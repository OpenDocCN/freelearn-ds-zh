- en: A balanced team solves all incoming tasks efficiently and effortlessly. Each
    team member complements others and helps others to find a solution with their
    unique capabilities. However, balanced teams do not just magically come into existence
    when a skillful leader assembles their elite squad. Finding team Zen is not a
    momentary achievement; you need to work to find it. It may seem that some teams
    are stellar performers while others are underwhelming. It is crucial to realize
    that team performance is not a constant state. The best teams can become the worst,
    and vice versa. Each team should work to improve. Some teams may need less work,
    while others will be harder to change, but no team is hopeless.

  zh: 一个平衡的团队能够高效、轻松地解决所有来临的任务。每个团队成员互相补充，利用各自的独特能力帮助他人找到解决方案。然而，平衡的团队并不会在一个技能高超的领导者组建精英小队时神奇地自然而然地形成。找到团队的“禅意”不是一时的成就；你需要付出努力才能找到它。看起来某些团队表现出色，而其他团队则令人失望。但关键是要意识到，团队表现并非恒定不变的。最优秀的团队也可能变得最糟，反之亦然。每个团队都应该努力改进。有些团队可能需要的工作较少，而另一些团队则更难改变，但没有团队是没有希望的。
- en: But what makes a balanced team? Each team member is unique in their soft and
    hard skill sets. Some people are a universal jack of all trades, while others
    are highly specialized in a single area of expertise. Also, we all have vast emotional
    differences. In a balanced team, everyone complements and augments each other.
    Each team member knows at what point they can participate to yield the best results.
    Balanced teams are self-organizing. They can efficiently plan and act without
    direct interventions from the team leader. The leader unites the team and makes
    it coherent, but the actual work process of a balanced team looks highly decentralized.
    The leader frequently takes part in teamwork and helps everyone reach a common
    goal. The team members have good relationships and want to advance themselves
    to new heights. Another feature of balanced teams is that they do not have a single
    point of failure. If someone is ill or has decided to move on, it is not a big
    deal regarding how the core team functions.

  zh: 那么，平衡的团队是什么样的呢？每个团队成员在软硬技能上都有独特之处。有些人是全能型的多面手，而其他人则在某一领域具有高度专业化的专长。此外，我们每个人在情感上也有很大的差异。在平衡的团队中，每个人都能够互补和增强对方的能力。每个团队成员都知道在何时参与能产生最佳的结果。平衡的团队是自组织的，它们能够高效地进行规划和行动，而无需团队领导的直接干预。领导者将团队凝聚在一起，使团队更加有序，但平衡团队的实际工作过程显得高度去中心化。领导者经常参与团队工作，并帮助大家达成共同目标。团队成员之间有着良好的关系，大家都希望不断提升自己，迈向新的高度。平衡团队的另一个特点是，它们没有单点故障。如果有人生病或决定离开，团队核心的运作也不会受到太大影响。

- en: In the first case, the team leader is the best expert in the team. They do most
    of the important work, while other team members work on the simplest delegated
    tasks. The team leader decomposes the task into many simple subtasks and assigns
    them to their team. No one sees the whole picture but them. The unwillingness
    to share important parts of the work and to involve the team in the task's decomposition
    process creates a strong imbalance. The team is very fragile and will not function
    properly without its leader. Employees in this team burn out quickly because they
    do not see the result of their work. Most of the tasks are boring and repetitive,
    so they seek challenges in another team, project, or company. This is a case of
    expertise imbalance in a team.

  zh: 在第一种情况下，团队负责人是团队中最优秀的专家。他们做大部分重要工作，而其他团队成员则负责最简单的委派任务。团队负责人将任务分解成许多简单的子任务并分配给团队成员。除了他们自己，没有人能看到全貌。不愿意分享重要的工作部分，也不愿意让团队参与任务分解过程，这种做法造成了强烈的失衡。这个团队非常脆弱，没有团队负责人，团队将无法正常运作。团队中的员工很快就会感到倦怠，因为他们看不到自己工作的成果。大部分任务枯燥重复，因此他们会寻求其他团队、项目或公司的挑战。这是团队中专业失衡的一个例子。
- en: In the second case, the team is building a very large project. The development
    has been going on for 3 years. The team leader and several data scientists who
    were working on the project from the start developed strong relationships and
    a team culture. However, not all of the team members stayed with them for the
    whole 3 years, so the team leader found several new experts eager to take on the
    project. However, these new team members found it hard to assimilate into the
    team. The **core team **unwillingly communicates with the **new team**. They find
    it hard to do so because of the cultural gap. It is a lot easier to interact with
    familiar people than with the **new team**. Thus, cultural imbalance has emerged.

- en: Just like when you're hiring staff to build a balanced team, you should look
    toward your goal. Without a goal, there is no reason for action, no balance, and
    no imbalance. For example, your goal could be *delivering solutions for problems
    using data science with a short time to market*. From this goal, the main characteristics
    of your team will arise. To successfully apply data science, you will need experts
    in the field. To do this with a short time to market, you will need good internal
    processes so that everyone works smoothly and reliably. The team will need to
    improve over time, and it will need to grow and last; this is the need for balance.

  zh: 就像在招聘人员以建立平衡的团队时一样，你应该着眼于目标。没有目标，就没有行动的理由，没有平衡，也没有失衡。例如，你的目标可能是*在短时间内利用数据科学交付问题解决方案*。从这个目标出发，团队的主要特点将逐渐显现。为了成功地应用数据科学，你需要该领域的专家。为了实现短时间交付，你还需要良好的内部流程，确保每个人都能顺畅可靠地工作。团队需要随着时间的推移不断改进，并且需要成长和持续发展；这就是平衡的需求。
- en: State your goals clearly and ensure all team members understand them so that
    everyone is on the same page about the definition of success. It would be impossible

- en: Another important component of each team is its roles. Roles define sets of
    activities that team members can perform. You may think you do not need roles
    because your team is agile and cross-functional, so everyone can and should be
    able to do everything. This may be crucial for small teams to survive while being
    adroit at what they do. But being cross-functional does not contradict having
    clearly defined roles. In fact, cross-functionality and size are different dimensions
    of a team, with the latter affecting the former through the number of roles each
    team member is performing.

    of. At first, you may be scared, but I assure you, they will surprise you. The
    tricky part of delegation is the task description step. Delegation will cause
    failure if you cannot describe what needs to be done correctly and without over-complicating
    the matter. To delegate effectively, you can make use of situational leadership.

    People with high commitment levels find their work interesting and are ready to
    try hard until the task is completed. A low commitment level, on the other hand,
    indicates that the person is not very interested in completing a task, finds it
    boring or repetitive, or is close to burning out. The other side of the coin is
    competence, which indicates the employee''s ability to handle tasks by themselves.
    Low competence indicates that the person has no or low prior experience in the
    area, regarding the task they need to complete. A high competency level indicates
    that the employee has all the necessary knowledge and experience to complete the
    task. Situational leadership helps you keep motivation levels stable while ensuring

    is empathy. Being empathetic means to understand your emotions, as well as other
    people's emotions. Our reactions are mostly irrational, and we often confuse our
    own feelings and emotions. For example, it is easy to confuse anger for fear;
    we can act angrily when in reality we are just afraid. Understanding your own
    emotions and learning to recognize others will help you understand people and
    see subtleties and motives behind their actions. Empathy helps us find the logic
    behind irrational actions so that we can react properly. It may be easy to answer
    with anger in regard to aggressive behavior unless you can understand the motives
    behind those actions. If you can see those motives, acting angrily may seem foolish
    in the end. Empathy is the ultimate conflict-resolution tool; it helps build trust

- en: Being empathetic is not an innate ability. Of course, some people are naturally
    more empathetic than others, but this does not mean that empathy can't be acquired.
    It is a skill, and like any other skill, it can be mastered if you work on it.
    To increase your empathy, start with yourself. Be aware of your own emotions throughout
    the day. If you encounter a complex situation, think through your actions and
    emotions. Try to understand which of your responses were adequate and which were
    not to see what caused them and what you felt at that moment. Sometimes, you will
    find mismatches between your feelings and your actions. Learn from them. Over
    time, you will start to understand emotions better and better. First, learn to

    The main idea behind it is that it does not matter whether you read a whole book
    in one day or a single informative tweet: all learning counts. You should aim
    to learn something new each day—even a small amount. In the end, you will not
    only move a bit closer to the goal of learning something but also develop a set
    of habits that will allow you to gain more and more knowledge without even noticing
    it. After a while, continuous learning will be a part of your life, developing
    a natural hunger for new, useful information, like a scheduler that optimizes
    your free time in the background and squeezes spare minutes you spend commuting
    and waiting in long store lines to help you progress toward something that really
    matters to you.'

- en: 'After creating the learning plan template, you can talk with everyone on your
    team to discover their professional goals. Ask them which areas they want to grow
    in and understand what interests them personally. Ask them to go through your
    learning plan template and write their approximate competency level in each topic
    and help them if they can''t do this alone. With this information, you will understand
    where each team member is now and where they want to go. You can then create a
    personal learning plan. I find simple task-tracking systems such as Trello to
    be a good tool for tracking learning goals—create shared boards for your teammates
    and create cards in meetings. As with any task, a learning plan is better if it''s
    defined in accordance with the SMART criteria. In particular, make sure it is
    realistic (reading 100 books a year may be a realistic goal for some people, but
    not for others) and time-bound. Each learning plan should have a deadline. At
    this deadline, you and your teammate should meet again and adjust the learning
    plan: decide on the next goal, create new cards, and delete obsolete goals. In
    your second meeting, you may discover that many learning plans have been unfinished.
    This means that you will need to adjust the amount of learning material for the
    next period. All that matters is that progress never stops, not how many learning
    cards have been completed.'

  zh: 在创建学习计划模板后，你可以与团队中的每个人交流，了解他们的职业目标。询问他们希望在哪些领域成长，并了解他们个人感兴趣的内容。请他们查看你的学习计划模板，并在每个主题中写下他们的大致能力水平，如果他们无法独立完成此任务，你可以帮助他们。有了这些信息，你将了解每个团队成员目前的状况以及他们的目标。接着，你可以为他们制定个人学习计划。我发现简单的任务跟踪系统，如Trello，是跟踪学习目标的好工具——为你的队员创建共享板块，并在会议中创建卡片。和任何任务一样，学习计划如果能根据SMART标准来定义会更好。特别是，要确保它是现实的（每年读100本书对某些人来说可能是现实的目标，但对其他人却不一定）并且具有时间限制。每个学习计划应该有一个截止日期。在这个截止日期，你和你的队友应该再次会面，并调整学习计划：决定下一个目标，创建新的卡片，并删除过时的目标。在第二次会议中，你可能会发现许多学习计划未完成。这意味着你需要调整下一阶段的学习材料数量。最重要的是，进步永远不能停止，而不是已经完成了多少学习卡片。
- en: Learning plans are worthless without planned time for research and education.
    Planned time can be personal, but you should not be confident that your team will
    educate itself only in their free time. Give them opportunities to learn in work
    hours too. It is common to have free gaps between projects or when waiting for
    someone to finish parts of the work you depend on. On rare occasions, some of
    your teammates could have several days of downtime, waiting for new tasks. Use
    this time wisely. You should communicate to your team that if they do not have
    any assigned tasks, they should learn according to their personal plan after reporting
    to you. In some cases, company policy can be against learning in the workplace.
    Try to communicate that learning is a long-term investment that will allow your
    team to perform better.

  zh: 学习计划没有为研究和教育规划时间是没有价值的。规划的时间可以是个人的，但你不应该指望你的团队仅仅在空闲时间自我教育。也要给他们在工作时间学习的机会。项目之间或者等待他人完成你依赖的工作部分时，通常会有空闲时间。在少数情况下，你的队员可能会有几天的空闲时间，等待新的任务。请明智地利用这段时间。你应该和你的团队沟通，如果他们没有分配到任务，在向你汇报后，他们应该按照个人计划进行学习。在某些情况下，公司政策可能反对在工作场所学习。你应该尝试沟通，让团队理解学习是一项长期投资，能够让他们更好地发挥。
- en: Another important component of forming a learning habit is to have compensation
    options for paid courses and books. Learning materials and online courses may
    be expensive. Your teammates may have other plans for their income than paying
    for books that will make them better at work. If someone understands that investing
    in education will have much greater returns, that's great, but not everyone will
    understand this from the start. People need to experience this process by themselves.
    They need to see that learning helps them to improve, both in terms of income
    and skills. Having corporate plans for compensating successfully finished courses
    or books is not expensive, and it will kick-start learning habits for your team.

- en: 'The last but not the least component, is a performance review. The sole purpose
    of a performance review is to share bidirectional feedback and have a clear view
    of individual progress. The number of ways you can try to track performance is
    infinite. Many companies use some kind of **key performance indicator** (**KPI**)
    system. A KPI is a single number that should be an adequate measure of your success.
    The total amount of sales in $ is a frequent KPI in sales departments. It may
    seem to be a good KPI at first. Sales departments should sell, right? Tying the
    department''s success to this number is akin to telling everyone: *All you should
    think of is selling more. Nothing else.* But this is a very short-term goal. The
    reality of sales departments is much more high-dimensional than a single number.
    If we transition to software development or data science departments, KPIs become
    even more cumbersome and complex. How will you measure a programmer''s or a data
    scientist''s performance? Maybe we can take a number of experiments, or a number
    of lines of code per day? All of these measures are utterly irrelevant to real
    success.'

  zh: 最后但同样重要的一个组成部分是绩效评审。绩效评审的唯一目的是共享双向反馈，并清晰地了解个人进展。你可以尝试跟踪绩效的方式有无数种。许多公司使用某种**关键绩效指标**（**KPI**）系统。KPI是一个单一的数字，应该能够充分衡量你的成功。销售部门常见的KPI是销售总额（以$为单位）。这看起来最初是一个好的KPI。销售部门的目标就是卖东西，对吧？把部门的成功与这个数字挂钩就像是在告诉大家：*你们只需要想着卖更多东西，其他的都不重要*。但这是一个非常短期的目标。销售部门的现实要比单一数字复杂得多。如果我们转到软件开发或数据科学部门，KPI变得更加繁琐和复杂。你如何衡量一个程序员或数据科学家的表现？也许我们可以用实验的数量，或者每天编写的代码行数？这些标准与真正的成功完全无关。
- en: In all honesty, I haven't seen a successful implementation of an individual
    KPI yet. KPIs work best for business processes, while personal KPIs are very one-dimensional
    and unrealistic. If you tie an individual's success to a single number, they will
    either end up fighting with the system or exploiting it. A better but more time-consuming
    way to track performance and set goals is by using performance reviews. A performance
    review is typically carried out once or twice a year.

    best expert in the team, Robert has carefully thought about how to delegate tasks
    using situational leadership so that the data scientists on his team will be motivated
    and will have room to grow and take on more complex tasks along the way.'

    and interview scenarios, as described in [Chapter 5](0f8f01a4-419c-44fe-abb1-f8ed6b6037fa.xhtml), *Conducting
    a Data Science Interview.* To facilitate the growth mindset, he defined learning
    plan templates for each team role based on his experience. He focused on roles
    instead of positions because some combined positions may split when the team grows,
    and role-based growth tracks will allow those splits to occur naturally. Robert
    also created a quick team leader guide where he stated the standards for task
    delegation based on situational leadership and the SMART criteria and set up a
    performance review schedule for each team.

  zh: 接下来，罗伯特为每个职位定义了工作流程，以便创建准确的职位描述和面试场景，如在[第5章](0f8f01a4-419c-44fe-abb1-f8ed6b6037fa.xhtml)《进行数据科学面试》中所描述的那样。为了促进成长型思维，他根据自己的经验为每个团队角色定义了学习计划模板。他专注于角色而不是职位，因为一些合并的职位可能会随着团队的增长而拆分，而基于角色的成长轨迹将使这些拆分自然发生。罗伯特还创建了一份快速团队领导指南，其中阐述了基于情境领导和SMART标准的任务分配标准，并为每个团队设立了绩效评审日程。

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we explored the complex topic of building and sustaining a
    team. First, we dived into the concept of team balance and looked at why it is
    crucial for a team's survival in the long term. Then, we learned about several
    leadership styles, including the situational leadership model and leadership by
    example. We then saw how we can create good task descriptions using the SMART
    criteria. We also mentioned empathy and active listening as the most important
    soft skills of a leader. We also explored the concepts of continuous learning
    and a growth mindset. Finally, we saw how a performance review process can help
    learning habits develop in your team.
