- en: Over the last several years, data in financial institutions has moved from being
    a risk that needs to be controlled to recognizing that data assets represent strategic
    sources of insight to be leveraged across the enterprise. The role of Chief Data
    and Analytics Officer (CDAO), therefore, has moved from being more focused on
    the defensive angle to data and analytics (preventing bad things from happening)
    to offensive (using data and insights to drive additive revenue and customer experiences
    to the company). This change has moved the CDAO into the role of being a trusted
    business executive and out of the back office.

    specializes in small business banking and prioritizes supporting small and medium-sized
    enterprises with customized solutions. Recently, *The Bank of the Midwest* has
    been under pressure from its primary regulator for some cash-handling malpractice

    the short-term cash position of the organization was full of inaccuracies. The
    primary regulator requested a full review of the report production, including
    all underlying systems and data flows, and a review of the company. This report
    is critical for banks because it compares their short-term assets (cash, convertible
    securities, and so on) and their short-term liabilities (deposits, short-term
    loans, and so on). By comparing the values, the bank is able to determine its

- en: As you reviewed the approach in this use case, in concert with the previous
    16 chapters, I hope it is abundantly clear that there is no single approach for
    data governance. Every company and every situation is unique. What works at one
    company won’t work for a similar company in the same industry. This is why I offered
    alternative options in this chapter and examples throughout the book to showcase
    what has and has not worked previously for me. Ultimately, any data professional
    will have successes and failures in their career. One of the hardest lessons to
    learn (for me) is that what was recommended this year may have been recommended
    in the past but now is effective because the company is facing new challenges
    or priorities. Thus, sometimes, just changing circumstances will allow for the
    same suggestion to work in your environment now, whereas it was rejected previously.
