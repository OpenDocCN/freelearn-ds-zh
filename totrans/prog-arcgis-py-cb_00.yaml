    *Fundamentals of the Python Language for ArcGIS*, will cover many of the basic
    language constructs found in Python. Initially, you''ll learn how to create new
    Python scripts or edit existing scripts. From there, you''ll get into language
    features, such as adding comments to your code, variables, and the built-in typing
    systems that makes coding with Python easy and compact. Furthermore, we''ll look
    at the various built-in data types that Python offers, such as strings, numbers,
    lists, and dictionaries. In addition to this, we''ll cover statements, including
    decision support and looping structures for making decisions in your code, and/or
    looping through a code block multiple times.'

    Map Documents and Layers*, will use the ArcPy mapping module to manage map document
    and layer files. You will learn how to add and remove geographic layers from map
    document files, insert layers into data frames, and move layers around within
    the map document. You will also learn how to update layer properties and symbology.'

    or update data from geographic data layers and tables. With the new ArcGIS 10.1
    Data Access module, geoprocessing scripts can create in-memory tables of data,
    called cursors, from feature classes and tables. You will learn how to create
