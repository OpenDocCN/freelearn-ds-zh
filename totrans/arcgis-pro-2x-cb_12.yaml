- en: ArcGIS Online is Esri’s GIS cloud solution. It allows you and your organization
    to easily share data, maps, tools, and applications that can then be accessed
    via the internet. Prior to ArcGIS Online, you were required to have a dedicated
    GIS web server, such as ArcGIS Server, to provide web-based content to your users.

- en: So, what is a cloud solution? The word Cloud is used a lot nowadays, but few
    really know what it is. Simply put, a cloud solution is one that leverages the
    internet to deliver a product. This can be in the form of hardware (servers),
    platforms (Windows, iOS, Linux), or software (Microsoft 365, Constant Contact,
    Salesforce).

- en: As a SaaS, ArcGIS Online provides the necessary tools to create interactive
    maps and apps, share and manage data, and integrate with other ArcGIS applications
    or other vendor solutions. ArcGIS Online also provides security that controls
    who can access your data. Like you own local network, ArcGIS Online requires users
    to log in to create, modify, or upload content. When you publish content in ArcGIS
    Online, you get to choose who you share it with. You can choose to share it with
    no one, which means only you can access it. You can opt to share it with the members
    of your organization, with part of a specific group, or you can choose to share
    content with everyone. This all assumes you are a Level 2 user. ArcGIS Online
    can even be integrated with your own local network security and logins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ArcGIS Online supports two user levels, Level 1 and Level 2\. Level 1 users
    are allowed to access and view content. So, they could view data shared via a
    web app with those in the organization or open a mobile application that allows
    them to view and query data. Level 1 users are not allowed to create, modify,
    upload, or share content. Those functions require you to be a Level 2 user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Level 2 users are permitted much greater access to ArcGIS Online content than
    Level 1\. Their access and capabilities are determined by the role assigned to
    their username. ArcGIS includes four basic user roles: viewer, user, publisher,
    and administrator. Each of these roles builds on the capabilities of the previous
    one. The view role limits the user to view only. So, they would be limited to
    the same basic access as a Level 1 user. The user role allows the user to edit
    features, add items, and share content. The publisher role allows users to publish
    hosted web maps as well as analyze the performance of layers in a web map. Administrators
    have the ability to manage other users, configure organizational settings, and
    manage ArcGIS Pro licenses.  You can also create custom roles that mix and match
    the capabilities of the four primary roles. To learn more about the different
    ArcGIS Online user roles, go to [http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/roles.htm](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/roles.htm).'

- en: Doing things in ArcGIS Online costs credits. Most things that you do in ArcGIS
    Online cost some amount of credits. This includes storing data, hosting applications,
    and using ArcGIS Online services. Some things cost very few credits, such as storing
    data. It only costs about 1.2 credits per month per 1 GB of data stored in ArcGIS
    Online. Other functions cost more, such as geocoding or reporting. It costs 40
    credits per 1,000 addresses you geocode. To learn more about credits and how they
    work, go to [http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/credits.htm](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/credits.htm).
    Credits are fairly cheap. You can get 1,000 credits for only $100.00.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each license of ArcGIS Pro includes one Level 2 ArcGIS Online user and 100 credits.
    The ArcGIS Pro license level does not matter. If an organization (that is, business,
    agency, governmental unit) is the owner of the licenses, then they are combined.
    So if a City were to have three licenses of ArcGIS Pro, they would then get three
    level 2 users and 300 credits. These would be renewed each year, as long as the
    ArcGIS Pro licenses software maintenance is renewed.

    can easily access a wealth of data, maps, and other services that expand the capabilities
    of your GIS. You will also find that much of the workflow between the two is very
    similar. This makes it much easier for users to shift back and forth between the
    two solutions.

    to ArcGIS Online. You will learn how to log in to your account and begin accessing
    content.  Then, you will learn how to create a very simple web map using existing
    ArcGIS Online data. Next, you will explore ArcGIS Online’s integration with ArcGIS
    Pro. You will learn how you bring data layers from ArcGIS Online into your own
    maps. Then, you will learn how to access demographic information from ArcGIS Online.
    Lastly, you will learn how to access some of the geoprocessing tools from ArcGIS
    Online.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ArcGIS Online is more than just data and maps. It also contains powerful analysis
    or geoprocessing tools as well. These tools can allow you to perform analysis
    that would normally require you to have an extension, such as calculate service
    areas, determine watersheds, and create elevation profiles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned, those types of analysis typically require an extension. For example,
    to calculate a service area, you would need the Network Analyst extension. However
    with ArcGIS Pro, you can access this functionality as a ready-to-use tool without
    an extension. These ready-to-use tools do use credits, and typically more credits
    than the Infographics tool. The amount of credits used by each tool is determined
    by a base level for the tool plus the additional options you select that add complexity
    to the analysis. For example, if you needed to calculate a service area based
    on a simple driving distance that would use less credits than one that was based
    on driving time, during a specified time period, that also took one-way streets
    and weight limits into account and avoided toll roads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While these tools do use credits, they may still be a cheaper option than getting
    one of the Esri ArcGIS Extensions. The list price for an ArcGIS Extension is $2,500.00
    for a single license of one extension, whereas the credits required for each analysis
    is a fraction of that number. So, unless you also need to create the data used
    in the analysis and maintain it, then ArcGIS Online tools may be a more sustainable
    financial option for you to consider.

    the concrete in the delivery trucks start to become unusable.

    of this data specifically for them. Luckily, with the ArcGIS Online ready-to-use
