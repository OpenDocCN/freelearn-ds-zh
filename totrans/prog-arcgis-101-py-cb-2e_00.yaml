    *Fundamentals of the Python Language for ArcGIS*, will cover many of the basic
    language constructs found in Python. Initially, you''ll learn how to create new
    Python scripts or edit existing scripts. From there, you''ll get into language
    features, such as adding comments to your code, variables, and the built-in typing
    systems that makes coding with Python easy and compact. Furthermore, we''ll look
    at the various built-in data-types that Python offers, such as strings, numbers,
    lists, and dictionaries. In addition to this, we''ll cover statements, including
    decision support and looping structures for making decisions in your code and/or
    looping through a code block multiple times.'

    document files, insert layers into data frames, and move layers around within
    the map document. The reader will also learn how to update layer properties and
    symbology.'
