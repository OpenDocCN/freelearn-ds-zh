    as we did in [*Chapter 7*](B14769_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160). With this practical
    application of iSAX, we have reached the last chapter of this book! Thank you
    for reading this book, which is a collaborative effort of lots of people and not
    just the author.

- en: Time series and time series data mining, in general, are hot topics both in
    academia and industry, mainly because nowadays, data usually comes in a time series
    manner. As if this were not enough, those time series contain a lot of data that
    we need to process quickly and accurately.

- en: Time series are everywhere! But time series tend to get larger and larger as
    we collect more data, more frequently. Therefore, we need ways to process and
    search large time series faster and faster in order to make useful deductions
    from the data.

- en: The iSAX index is here to help you search your time series data fast. I hope
    that this book has given you the necessary tools and knowledge to begin working
    with time series and subsequences, as well as the iSAX index in Python. However,
    the knowledge and the presented techniques are easily transferable to other programming
    languages, including but not limited to *Swift*, Java, C, *C++*, Ruby, Kotlin,
    *Go*, *Rust*, and *JavaScript*.

    indexing using the right amount of theory and practice so you can successfully
    work with time series and develop iSAX indexes.

    for answering SQL queries fast. Even if they are not directly connected to time
    series, you might want to have a look at them and adjust them in order to work
    with time series and subsequences.

    based on the SAX representation and tries to correct the disadvantages of iSAX.
    The name of the new index is **Dumpy**. The core logic behind Dumpy is the same
    as in iSAX, but it makes adjustments during the building of the index in order
    to have a better subsequence distribution inside the index.
