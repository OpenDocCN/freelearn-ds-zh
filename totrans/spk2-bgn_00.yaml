- en: 'The data processing framework named Spark was first built to prove that, by
    re-using the data sets across a number of iterations, it provided value where
    Hadoop MapReduce jobs performed poorly. The research paper *Mesos: A Platform
    for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center* talks about the philosophy
    behind the design of Spark. A very simplistic reference implementation built to
    test Mesos by the University of California Berkeley researchers has grown far
    and beyond to become a full blown data processing framework later became one of
    the most active Apache projects. It is designed from the ground up to do distributed
    data processing on clusters such as Hadoop, Mesos, and in standalone mode. Spark
    is a JVM-based data processing framework and hence it works on most operating
    systems that support JVM-based applications. Spark is widely installed on UNIX
    and Mac OS X, platforms and Windows adoption is increasing.'

- en: Spark provides a unified programming model using the programming languages Scala,
    Java, Python and R. In other words, irrespective of the language used to program
    Spark applications, the API remains almost the same in all the languages. In this
    way, organizations can adopt Spark and develop applications in their programming
    language of choice. This also enables fast porting of Spark applications from
    one language to another without much effort, if there is a need. Most of Spark
    is developed using Scala and because of that the Spark programming model inherently
    supports functional programming principles. The most basic Spark data abstraction
    is the resilient distributed data set (RDD), based on which all the other libraries
    are built. The RDD-based Spark programming model is the lowest level where developers
    can build data processing applications.

    When such a forward-looking step is taken with respect to the product road map,
    the requirement emerged to make the programming more high level for business users. 
    The Spark SQL library on top of Spark Core, with its DataFrame abstraction, was
    built to cater to the needs of the huge population of developers who are very
    conversant with the ubiquitous SQL.

- en: Data scientists use R for their computation needs. The biggest limitation of
    R is that all the data that needs to be processed should *fit* into the main memory
    of the computer on which the R program is running. The R API for Spark introduced
    data scientists to the world of distributed data processing in their familiar
    data frame abstraction. In other words, using the R API for Spark, the processing
    of data can be done in parallel on Hadoop or Mesos, growing far beyond the limitation
    of the resident memory of the host computer.

- en: In the present era of large-scale applications that collect data, the velocity
    of the data that is ingested is very high. Many application use cases mandate
    real-time processing of the data that is streamed. The Spark Streaming library,
    built on top of Spark Core, does exactly the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data at rest or the data that is streamed are fed to machine learning algorithms 
    to train data models and use them to provide answers to business questions. All
    the machine learning frameworks that were created before Spark had many limitations
    in terms of the memory of the processing computer, inability to do parallel processing,
    repeated read-write cycles, so on. Spark doesn't have any of these limitations
    and hence the Spark MLlib machine learning library, built on top of Spark Core
    and Spark DataFrames, turned out to be the best of breed machine learning library
    that glues together the data processing pipelines and machine learning activities.

- en: Graph is a very useful data structure used heavily in some special use cases.
    The algorithms used to process the data in a graph data structure are computationally
    intensive. Before Spark, many graph processing frameworks came along, and some
    of them were really fast at processing, but pre-processing the data needed to
    produce the graph data structure turned out to be a big bottleneck in most of
    these graph processing applications. The Spark GraphX library, built on top of
    Spark, filled this gap to make data processing and graph processing as chained
    activities.

- en: In the past, many data processing frameworks existed and many of them were proprietary
    forcing organizations to get into the trap of vendor lock-in. Spark provided a
    very viable alternative for a wide variety of data processing needs with no licensing
    cost; at the same time, it was backed by many leading companies, providing professional
    production support.
