<p>The title of the book you are reading is <em class="italic">Time Series Indexing</em>, which should hint at its contents.</p>
<p>The time series index discussed and explored in this book is called iSAX. iSAX is considered one of the best indexes for time series, which is the main reason for choosing it. Besides implementing iSAX and the SAX representation as Python 3 packages, this book shows how to work with time series at the subsequence level and understand the information presented in academic research papers.</p>
<p>But the book does not stop here as it presents Python scripts <a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>for getting to know your time series data better and code for visualizing time series data and iSAX indexes to better understand the data as well as the structure of a particular iSAX index.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for developers, researchers, and university students of any level that want to work with time series at the subsequent level and use a modern time series index in the process.</p>
<p>Although the presented code is in Python 3, once you understand the ideas and the concepts behind the code, the packages and scripts can easily be ported to any other modern programming language, such as Rust, Swift, Go, C, Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, and so on.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B14769_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">An Introduction to Time Series and the Required Python Knowledge</em>, is all about the fundamentals that you need to know to follow this book, including the importance of time series and how to set up a proper Python environment to run the code of the book and experiment with time series.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_02_MA.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing SAX</em>, explains SAX and the SAX representation and presents Python code for computing the SAX representation of a time series or a subsequence. It also presents Python scripts that calculate statistical quantities that can give a higher overview of a time series and plot histograms of your time series data.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">iSAX – The Required Theory</em>, presents the theory behind the construction and the use of the iSAX index and shows how to manually construct a small iSAX index step by step using lots of visualizations.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">iSAX - The Implementation</em>, is about developing a Python package for creating iSAX indexes that fit in memory and presents Python scripts that put that Python package into action.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor124"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Joining and Comparing iSAX Indexes</em>, shows how to use iSAX indexes created by the <code>isax</code> package and how to join and compare them. At the end of the chapter, the subject of testing Python code is discussed. Last, we show how to write some simple tests for the <code>isax</code> package.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Visualizing iSAX Indexes</em>, is all about visualizing iSAX indexes using various types of visualizations using the JavaScript programming language and the JSON format.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using iSAX to Approximate MPdist</em>, is about using iSAX indexes to approximately compute the Matrix Profile vectors and the MPdist distance between two time series.</p>
<p><a href="B14769_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conclusions and Next Steps</em>, gives you directions on what and where to look next if you are really into time series or databases by proposing classical books and research papers to study.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>This book requires a UNIX machine with a relatively recent Python 3 installation and the ability to install Python packages locally. This includes any machine running recent versions of macOS and Linux. All the code has been tested on a Microsoft Windows machine.</p>
<p>We propose that you use software for Python package, dependency, and environment management to have a stable Python 3 environment. We use Anaconda, but any similar tool is going to work fine.</p>
<p>Last, if you really want to make the best use of the book, then you need to experiment as much as you can with the presented Python code, create your own iSAX indexes and visualizations, and maybe port the code into a different programming language.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “We are going to perform our experiments using the following sliding window sizes: <code>16</code>, <code>256</code>, <code>1024</code>, <code>4096</code>, and <code>16384</code>.”</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
def query(ISAX, q):
    global totalQueries
    totalQueries = totalQueries + 1
    Accesses = 0
    # Create TS Node</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    # Query iSAX for TS1
    for idx in range(0, len(ts1)-windowSize+1):
        currentQuery = ts1[idx:idx+windowSize]
        found, ac = <strong class="bold">query(i1, currentQuery)</strong>
        if found == False:
            print("This cannot be happening!")
            return</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ ./accessSplit.py -s 8 -c 32 -t 500 -w 16384 500k.gz
Max Cardinality: 32 Segments: 8 Sliding Window: 16384 Threshold: 500 Default Promotion: False
OVERFLOW: 01111_10000_10000_01111_10000_01111_10000_01111
Number of splits: 6996
Number of subsequence accesses: 19201125</pre>
