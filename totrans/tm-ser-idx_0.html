<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>The title of the book you are reading is <em class="italic">Time Series Indexing</em>, which should hint at <span class="No-Break">its contents.</span></p>
<p>The time series index discussed and explored in this book is called iSAX. iSAX is considered one of the best indexes for time series, which is the main reason for choosing it. Besides implementing iSAX and the SAX representation as Python 3 packages, this book shows how to work with time series at the subsequence level and understand the information presented in academic <span class="No-Break">research papers.</span></p>
<p>But the book does not stop here as it presents Python scripts <a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>for getting to know your time series data better and code for visualizing time series data and iSAX indexes to better understand the data as well as the structure of a particular <span class="No-Break">iSAX index.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for developers, researchers, and university students of any level that want to work with time series at the subsequent level and use a modern time series index in <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
<p>Although the presented code is in Python 3, once you understand the ideas and the concepts behind the code, the packages and scripts can easily be ported to any other modern programming language, such as Rust, Swift, Go, C, Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B14769_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">An Introduction to Time Series and the Required Python Knowledge</em>, is all about the fundamentals that you need to know to follow this book, including the importance of time series and how to set up a proper Python environment to run the code of the book and experiment with <span class="No-Break">time series.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_02_MA.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing SAX</em>, explains SAX and the SAX representation and presents Python code for computing the SAX representation of a time series or a subsequence. It also presents Python scripts that calculate statistical quantities that can give a higher overview of a time series and plot histograms of your time <span class="No-Break">series data.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">iSAX – The Required Theory</em>, presents the theory behind the construction and the use of the iSAX index and shows how to manually construct a small iSAX index step by step using lots <span class="No-Break">of visualizations.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">iSAX - The Implementation</em>, is about developing a Python package for creating iSAX indexes that fit in memory and presents Python scripts that put that Python package <span class="No-Break">into action.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor124"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Joining and Comparing iSAX Indexes</em>, shows how to use iSAX indexes created by the <strong class="source-inline">isax</strong> package and how to join and compare them. At the end of the chapter, the subject of testing Python code is discussed. Last, we show how to write some simple tests for the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">isax</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> package.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Visualizing iSAX Indexes</em>, is all about visualizing iSAX indexes using various types of visualizations using the JavaScript programming language and the <span class="No-Break">JSON format.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Using iSAX to Approximate MPdist</em>, is about using iSAX indexes to approximately compute the Matrix Profile vectors and the MPdist distance between two <span class="No-Break">time series.</span></p>
<p><a href="B14769_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Conclusions and Next Steps</em>, gives you directions on what and where to look next if you are really into time series or databases by proposing classical books and research papers <span class="No-Break">to study.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>This book requires a UNIX machine with a relatively recent Python 3 installation and the ability to install Python packages locally. This includes any machine running recent versions of macOS and Linux. All the code has been tested on a Microsoft <span class="No-Break">Windows machine.</span></p>
<p>We propose that you use software for Python package, dependency, and environment management to have a stable Python 3 environment. We use Anaconda, but any similar tool is going to <span class="No-Break">work fine.</span></p>
<p>Last, if you really want to make the best use of the book, then you need to experiment as much as you can with the presented Python code, create your own iSAX indexes and visualizations, and maybe port the code into a different <span class="No-Break">programming language.</span></p>

<p>A block of code is set <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
def query(ISAX, q):
    global totalQueries

    Accesses = 0
    # Create TS Node</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set <span class="No-Break">in bold:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
    # Query iSAX for TS1
    for idx in range(0, len(ts1)-windowSize+1):
