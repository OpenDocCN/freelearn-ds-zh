    worksheet, it is time to start analyzing data. Data analysis and visualization
    go hand in hand in Tableau. Data visualization enables us to quickly understand
    and interpret the various trends in data. Tableau provides extensive options to
    slice and dice the data, and view it in different formats using visualizations,
    sets, filters, hierarchies, and so on. This chapter will detail each of these
    formats.

    Tableau based on your data. The graphs that are grayed out are those that can't
    be created with a combination of the chosen fields. To discover what is needed
    to generate a graph, you simply hover over it. For instance, in this case of the
    bar graph, we can see that, for horizontal bars, we need 0 or more Dimensions
    and 1 or more Measures. Similarly, if you hover over other charts, it will list
