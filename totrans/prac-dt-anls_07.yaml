    time series data. Then, we'll learn how to clean and join multiple datasets together
    using both SQL and DataFrames with Python. After that, we'll go back to data visualization
    and learn about the best practices when it comes to data storytelling. By the
    end of this section, you will understand the foundations of descriptive analytics.
