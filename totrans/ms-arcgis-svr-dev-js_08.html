They think it's a field for right-brain dominant artists. They treat color theory, typography, and whitespace as a foreign language. They long to push these tasks onto a web designer and focus on algorithms and API calls.</p><p>Many small firms, government agencies, and departments don't have the luxury of having a web designer on their staff, or even on call. These small organizations tend to consist of one or more people hired for their technical and analytical skills, while design skills are left as an afterthought. Maybe you're working for one of those right now.</p><p>While this chapter may not turn you into an instant web designer, it will help you use CSS to effectively lay out your web map applications.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How CSS is applied to an HTML document</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The different ways to position the map on a page</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to use Dojo's <code class="literal">dijit/layout</code> modules to style your page</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to add Bootstrap to the layout of your page</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec79"/>The inner workings of CSS</h1></div></div></div><p>As we mentioned<a id="id671" class="indexterm"/> in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Your First Mapping Application">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Your First Mapping Application</em>, the <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong> (<strong>CSS</strong>) tells the browser how to render an HTML page. As the browser scans through the HTML, it scans through all the <a id="id672" class="indexterm"/>applicable CSS styles from CSS files, as well as any overriding styling within the HTML, to see how it should render the element. CSS descriptions, such as color and font size, often cascade down from one element to its children unless specifically overridden. For example, the style applied to the <code class="literal">div</code> tag will also apply to the <code class="literal">p</code> tags inside it, as shown in the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm not red.&lt;/p&gt;
<strong>  &lt;div style="color:red;"&gt;</strong>
<strong>    &lt;p&gt;You caught me red-handed.&lt;/p&gt;</strong>
<strong>    &lt;p&gt;Me too.&lt;/p&gt;</strong>
<strong>  &lt;/div&gt;</strong>
  &lt;p&gt;I'm not red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><p>CSS works a little <a id="id673" class="indexterm"/>differently from most programming languages. In JavaScript, when you have a bug in part of your program, you can step through the code in your browser until you find the part that breaks. In CSS, however, the rules that define the look of an element can be stretched across multiple style sheets, and can even be written inside the element. The appearance of the element can also be impacted by elements both inside and out.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec117"/>Selector specificity</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id674" class="indexterm"/>browser decides how elements should be styled by comparing the selector types used to define the style. It applies weights based on the type and quantity of selectors used to define a style. Browsers have five basic ranks for CSS selectors, based on how specific they are. Technically, there is a zeroth selector when you use the <code class="literal">*</code> to select every element on the page but, compared to the other selectors, it has no value. Selector ranks are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By element (for example <code class="literal">h1</code>, <code class="literal">div</code>, or <code class="literal">p</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By element classes, attributes, and pseudo selectors. Some examples include:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">.email</code> or <code class="literal">.form</code> (classes)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">input[type='text']</code> (attributes)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">a:hover</code> or <code class="literal">p:first-child</code> (pseudo selectors)</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By IDs (for example <code class="literal">#main</code> or <code class="literal">#map-div</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By inline styles (<code class="literal">&lt;p style=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By styles marked <code class="literal">!important</code></li></ul></div><p>A common way to note specificity is to count the number of selectors in each category and separate them with a comma. A <code class="literal">p</code> selector gets a specificity of <code class="literal">1</code>, and a <code class="literal">p &gt; a</code> gets a specificity of <code class="literal">2</code>. However, a <code class="literal">p.special &gt; a</code> gets a specificity of <code class="literal">1,2</code>, because the class falls in a separate, higher category. A <code class="literal">#main</code> selector has a specificity of <code class="literal">1,0,0</code> while the inline style of a <code class="literal">p</code> tag earns a specificity of <code class="literal">1,0,0,0</code>. The powerful <code class="literal">!important</code> clause is the only thing that can override an inline selector, and it earns a specificity of <code class="literal">1,0,0,0,0</code>.</p><p>When comparing selector specificity, a single higher rank selector beats any number of lower rank selectors. In the case of a tie, the next lowest is compared. For example, let's take a look at the following HTML snippet:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;style&gt;
  .addr { background: red; }
  .start.blank { background: orange; }
  .help.blank.addr { background: yellow; }
  #citytxt { background: green; }
  input[type='text'] { background: blue; }
  input { background: purple; }
&lt;/style&gt;
…
&lt;input type="text" id="citytxt" class="addr start blank help" /&gt;</pre></div><p>What do you <a id="id675" class="indexterm"/>think the background color will be from this? The correct answer is green. The <code class="literal">#citytxt</code> rule is a third ranked selector, since it points to an individual element on the page. If we look at the selectors along with their specificity ranks, they look as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;style&gt;
  .addr { background: red; }               /* 0,1,0 */
  .start.blank { background: orange; }     /* 0,2,0 */
  .help.blank.addr { background: yellow; } /* 0,3,0 */
  #citytxt { background: green; }          /* 1,0,0 */
  input[type='text'] { background: blue; } /* 0,1,1 */
  input { background: purple; }            /* 0,0,1 */
&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div><p>So what happens when everything else is equal?</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec118"/>Equal selector specificity</h2></div></div></div><p>When<a id="id676" class="indexterm"/> two or more rules have equal selector specificity, the last one listed wins. This is another feature of the cascading effect of CSS. We always put the custom CSS after the Dojo and ArcGIS JavaScript API style sheets in our applications. Any style changes we make will then not be overridden by the other style sheets.</p><p>With the last in wins rule, we can undo any unintended side effects of CSS rules applied to our widgets. We don't always have to resort to using <code class="literal">!important</code> tags or writing inline styles that get lost in our code reviews. We can use the same strength of selector specificity, and get the result we want, as long as we put it after the old rule.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

We'll look at how they impact styles and further development negatively.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Next, we'll look into some good practices, such as using responsive design and normalizing style sheets.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We'll look at how to organize your style sheets to make them easier to extend and troubleshoot.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We'll cover how to position your map wherever your application needs it.</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec119"/>Styling don'ts</h2></div></div></div><p>Before<a id="id678" class="indexterm"/> I go too far with telling you what to do, let's go through a few things you should avoid. These bad design habits are typically picked up while working through beginner tutorials and copying and pasting single-page applications off the Internet:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Styling your elements inline: Trying to change the appearance of 20 or more paragraphs one by one is a pain.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Making everything important: The important clause allows you to override styles imposed by other widgets and imported style sheets, but don't get carried away.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Having lots of references to individual IDs: A few element ID references are fine but, if you want to reuse your CSS files on other pages, or in other projects, you want them as general as possible. Not everyone will be using your <code class="literal">#pink_and_purple_striped_address2_input</code> element.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Writing new changes to your CSS file at the bottom of your page: We all know that last in wins, but if you slap every new update at the bottom of the page, the file becomes a junk-drawer of unorganized CSS rules.</li></ul></div><p>Like any hard and fast rules, there are appropriate times to break them. But, by working within the bounds of these rules, you make it easier for yourself and others to maintain your applications.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec120"/>Responsive design</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id679" class="indexterm"/> <strong>responsive design</strong> movement has taken a firm hold on website development. Responsive design revolves around the idea that a website should be useable on a wide variety of screen sizes, from large monitors to mobile phone screens. This reduces the costs of maintaining multiple websites for desktop and mobile users.</p><p>On the surface, responsive design involves assigning percentage widths and heights instead of fixed sizes, but there is more. Fluid grid layouts support multiple columns on wider screens while collapsing down to a single column on narrow screens. Images at different resolutions can be served for tablets and screens with retina displays for crisper looking images. CSS media queries can change how elements are displayed at different sizes or across different media.</p><p>Maps created<a id="id680" class="indexterm"/> with the ArcGIS JavaScript API work well with responsive design layouts. The maps keep track of the size of their HTML container elements, and size changes, while updating their contents. While the map scale stays the same, the extent is recalculated, and new map tiles are requested for locations not previously stored in memory. These changes can be triggered by resizing the browser window in a desktop, or turning a tablet sideways in a mobile browser.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec121"/>Normalize.css</h2></div></div></div><p>It can<a id="id681" class="indexterm"/> be frustrating trying to make your application look good in your browser. Bringing in more browsers compounds the problem. Many browsers have unique rendering engines on different devices which make the same HTML elements look different on each device. Can't they all come to the same conclusion about how HTML elements should look?</p><p>Developers and designers often use a CSS file called <code class="literal">normalize.css</code> (<a class="ulink" href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/</a>). This style sheet styles HTML elements so that they all look similar on different browsers and devices. It cuts down on the guesswork when you are concerned about how a page will look.</p><p>The <code class="literal">normalize.css</code> file style is typically inserted as the first style sheet in the HTML document head. Any changes you make to your website's style will then be made after the normalize rules are applied, and are less likely to be overridden. Some CSS frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap, already incorporate <code class="literal">normalize.css</code> in their style sheets.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec122"/>Organizing your CSS</h2></div></div></div><p>As <a id="id682" class="indexterm"/>previously discussed in the list of things not to do with your styles, the<a id="id683" class="indexterm"/> greatest offenders involve using higher selector specificity than needed, and treating the style sheet like a junk drawer. By organizing your style sheet properly, you can cut down on both of these offenders, and make your application easier to style and maintain. Let's go through a few best practices.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec102"/>Organizing by selector specificity</h3></div></div></div><p>Current <a id="id684" class="indexterm"/>trends in web design call for CSS selectors to be organized from the lowest selector specificity to the highest. All your <code class="literal">div</code>, <code class="literal">h1</code>, and <code class="literal">p</code> tags might be put at the top of the page in your style sheet. After the appearances of the HTML elements are defined, you add various classes, selectors, and pseudo-selectors to describe how those would change the appearance of your elements. Finally, you could assign the appearances of an individual element by referencing its <code class="literal">id</code>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec103"/>Group by module</h3></div></div></div><p>Applications <a id="id685" class="indexterm"/>written with the ArcGIS JavaScript API can easily be organized by dijits, so why not arrange the style sheets by dijits as well? You can define the styling of individual dijits in the application after you define the style of your page. You can separate your CSS into logical sections using <code class="literal">/* comments */</code> between the module and dijit styles.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec104"/>A class for everything</h3></div></div></div><p>A common <a id="id686" class="indexterm"/>practice when organizing code for selector specificity is to assign CSS classes as much as possible. Your map dijits may have an <code class="literal">.open</code> class that sets the <code class="literal">width</code> and <code class="literal">height</code>. The same dijit may have a <code class="literal">.closed</code> class that hides the dijit. Using the <code class="literal">dojo/dom-class</code> module, you can add, remove, and toggle the classes you define, however you want:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">.open {
  width: 30%;
  height: 100%;
  display: block;
}
.closed {
  width: 0%;
  display: none;
}</pre></div><p>Using descriptive classes makes it easier to see what your application is doing, especially when you look at the page source. Descriptive classes are easier to reference in your style sheet.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec105"/>Media queries</h3></div></div></div><p>Media queries <a id="id687" class="indexterm"/>provide effective ways to create custom looks and responsive grids on different screens. You can change the look of your site depending on the media type (screen, print, projector, and so on), the screen width, and even the pixel depth (retina displays versus standard desktop screens).</p><p>One thing to consider when organizing your code is that media queries should be placed after normal selectors. You can then take advantage of the last in wins principal, and use the same selectors to show different results when the screen size changes. I've been guilty of not paying attention to where I placed my media queries, and wasted time troubleshooting why my transitions weren't occurring. Only later did I find, in the mess of CSS, where I had applied a rule after my media query that cancelled the effect.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec123"/>Positioning your map</h2></div></div></div><p>We can't always<a id="id688" class="indexterm"/> rely on other frameworks and style sheets to properly position our maps. Sometimes, we have to get our hands dirty with CSS and do it ourselves. We'll go through some styling scenarios for our maps, and look at what CSS rules we need to apply to the map element to position it properly. All examples assume that you're creating a map on a <code class="literal">div</code> element with the ID of "map".</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec124"/>The fixed-width map</h2></div></div></div><p>By <a id="id689" class="indexterm"/>default, a map is created with a specific width and height. The width and height can be any non-negative number, from a whole screen, to a narrow column. If a height is not assigned, a default <code class="literal">height</code> of <code class="literal">400px</code> is assigned to the map element. You can see a simple, non-responsive CSS style for the map here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  width: 600px;
  height: 400px;
}</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec125"/>Stretching the map to fullscreen</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, your <a id="id690" class="indexterm"/>map is more than just an important piece of the page. Sometimes, the map needs to take up the whole page. That is what this full screen size represents. This style works, assuming that the HTML and body tags have a width and height of <code class="literal">100%</code> as well. This full screen style can also be assigned to a map that is supposed to fill <code class="literal">100%</code> of the area in another element:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec126"/>Floating the map to the side</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes <a id="id691" class="indexterm"/>you don't want a full map. Sometimes you just want a small map on the side of the screen, showing the location of whatever content it's sharing the page with. You can then float the content off to the side. Floating an element to the right or the left lets other content fill in around it. This technique is typically used with photos and text, where the text flows around the photo. It works for a map as well:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  width: 30%;
  height: 30%;
  float: right;
}</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec127"/>Positioning the map top and center</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes<a id="id692" class="indexterm"/> you need to center your map in your layout. You have some text, and you just want the map to line up nicely in the middle. With this centering trick, you can horizontally center any block type element on a page. Here, you set the position to relative, and you assign a right and left margin of auto. The browser will automatically assign an equal number to the right and left margin, essentially centering it. But remember, this must be performed on a block element (like the map) with relative positioning. Remove any of these criteria, and the trick doesn't work, as shown in the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
/* just in case something sets the display to something else */
  display: block; 
  position: relative;
  margin: 0 auto;
}</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec128"/>Covering most of the page with the map</h2></div></div></div><p>If you need <a id="id693" class="indexterm"/>an almost full page effect, where you need to leave room for a title bar or a column to the right or left, you can use absolute positioning to stretch the map. Absolute positioning takes the element outside of the normal layout, and lets you position it wherever you want.</p><p>Once you assign absolute positioning to the map, you can use the top, bottom, left, and right values to stretch the map out. By assigning a value of <code class="literal">0</code> to the <code class="literal">bottom</code>, you're telling the browser to set the bottom edge of the element at the bottom of the page. By assigning a value of <code class="literal">40px</code> to the <code class="literal">top</code>, you are telling the browser to assign the top of the map element 40 pixels from the top of the page. By assigning both left and right values, you are stretching the map element out in both directions.</p><p>As a caveat, remember that absolutely positioned elements escape the bounds of their location, and will be positioned either on the whole page, or inside the first parent element that has relative positioning:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px; /* for a 40px tall titlebar */
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0; 
  right: 0;
}</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec129"/>Centering a map of known width and height</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, you <a id="id694" class="indexterm"/>need to put your map in the center of the page. You want to create a modal effect, where the map is centered both vertically and horizontally, kind of like a modal dialog. If you know the width and height of the map, you can pull this off easily. You assign absolute positioning to the map, and set the <code class="literal">top</code> and <code class="literal">left</code> edges of the map at <code class="literal">50%</code> of the page. This won't look right at first, until you assign the margins. The trick is to assign negative top and left margins, with values that are half the height and width of the map elements, respectively. What you get is a vertically and horizontally centered map that also works in older browsers:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  width: 640px;
  height: 480px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin: -240px 0 0 -320px;
}</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec130"/>Centering a map of unknown width and height</h2></div></div></div><p>If you <a id="id695" class="indexterm"/>implement percentages or other units into the styling of your map, you may not know at any one time how wide the map is. We can use absolute positioning to put the upper left corner of the element in the middle of the page, but how can the element be shifted so that it sits in the middle of the page? There is an easy way to center the map both vertically and horizontally when the width and height is variable. It requires a CSS3 transformation.</p><p>We can translate or move the element in any direction by using the CSS3 transformation. The first value moves it to the right or left, while the second value moves it up and down. Negative values signify translation to the left and up. We can apply width and height in pixels, or we can apply a percentage of the element's width to center it:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 60%;  /* any width is okay */
  height: 60%; /* any height is okay */
  <strong>-webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);</strong>
<strong>  -moz-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);</strong>
<strong>  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);</strong>
<strong>  -o-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);</strong>
<strong>  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); </strong>
<strong>    /* transform shifts it halfway back*/</strong>
}</pre></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"/>Tip</h3><p>CSS3 transformations are available in most modern browsers, with some slightly older ones requiring vendor prefixes. Internet Explorer 8 and earlier do not support these transformations.

The latest versions of Internet Explorer also have these in their developer tools.</p><p>Now that we've reviewed the tools we can use to test our layouts, let's look at the tools the ArcGIS JavaScript API provides to lay out our applications.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec82"/>Dojo layout</h1></div></div></div><p>Dojo uses<a id="id701" class="indexterm"/> its own framework to control the layout of the application. Dojo's layouts can be found in the <code class="literal">dijit/layout</code> modules. These modules can be used to implement full page applications with all their features implemented, by using the Dojo framework.</p><p>Dijits created with <code class="literal">dijit/layout</code> modules can be encoded directly in the HTML. These are encoded using the <code class="literal">data-dojo-type</code> attribute. Properties for these, including styling and behavior, are encoded in the <code class="literal">data-dojo-props</code> attribute of the element. These dijits can be loaded from HTML by using the <code class="literal">dojo/parser</code> module to parse the HTML.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip19"/>Tip</h3><p>Applications where the <code class="literal">dijit/layout</code> elements are loaded through HTML often break when <code class="literal">dojo/parser</code> doesn't have access to a <code class="literal">layout</code> module. Make sure that all the modules for the layout elements used in the HTML have been loaded in the <code class="literal">require()</code> or <code class="literal">define()</code> statement that calls the <code class="literal">parse()</code> method of the <code class="literal">dojo/parser</code> module. Check for misspellings, either in the module loaders, or in the HTML <code class="literal">data-dojo-type</code> attributes.</p></div></div><p>Layouts created with the <code class="literal">dijit/layout</code> modules can be divided into two classifications: <strong>Containers</strong> and <strong>Panes</strong>.

Containers come in a variety of shapes and functions. Some can show multiple panes at once, while others show one or a few at a time. In JavaScript, if you have access to the Container <code class="literal">dijit</code>, you can access the pane elements inside it by calling the container's <code class="literal">getChildren()</code> method.</p><p>Let's look at a few of the common containers.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec106"/>LayoutContainer</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">LayoutContainer</code> allow other panes to be positioned <a id="id704" class="indexterm"/>around a central pane.

Panes surrounding it are assigned region values of <code class="literal">top</code>, <code class="literal">bottom</code>, <code class="literal">right</code>, <code class="literal">left</code>, <code class="literal">leading</code>, or <code class="literal">trailing</code> to define their position in relation to the center pane. Multiple panes can have the same region attribute, such as two or three left panes. These will stack side by side to the left of the center pane.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec107"/>BorderContainer</h3></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id705" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">BorderContainer</code><a id="id706" class="indexterm"/> is derived from the <code class="literal">LayoutContainer</code>. As the name implies, it adds borders to section off the different panes in the application. <code class="literal">BorderContainers</code> can also provide <code class="literal">livesplitters</code>, which are draggable elements that let the user resize panes as they see fit.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec108"/>AccordionContainer</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id707" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">AccordionContainer</code> <a id="id708" class="indexterm"/>arrange and transition between panes using an accordion effectIn this arrangement, pane titles appear stacked on top of one another, and only one pane is visible at any time. The contents of the other panes are hidden by the accordion effect. When the user selects another pane within the <code class="literal">AccordionContainer</code>, the panes animate in a sliding motion, hiding the current pane and showing the selected pane.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec109"/>TabContainer</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id709" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">TabContainer</code> <a id="id710" class="indexterm"/>wi provides a tab-based organization of content. Tabs with the titles of the <code class="literal">ContentPane</code> enclosed describe the content, and clicking on those tabs removes the content visibility. The effect is similar to a Rolodex or a file folder, where you flip through tabs to view the content you need.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec133"/>Panes</h2></div></div></div><p>Panes<a id="id711" class="indexterm"/> in the <code class="literal">dijit/layout</code> modules provide a container in your <a id="id712" class="indexterm"/>application in which to put user controls and widgets. You can write HTML content or add other dijits. Panes can be encoded in HTML, or created with JavaScript and attached to their parent container. Let's look at a couple of the panes available in Dojo using the ArcGIS JavaScript API.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec110"/>ContentPane</h3></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id713" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">ContentPane</code><a id="id714" class="indexterm"/> tile is the most common pane inserted in a container. It can be inserted as a pane inside all the other containers, with the exception of the <code class="literal">AccordionContainer</code>. On the surface, they appear to be glorified <code class="literal">div</code> elements that also track size and relationship to other dijits around them. But a <code class="literal">ContentPane</code> tile can also downloads and displays content from other web pages. Setting the <code class="literal">ContentPane</code> tile's <code class="literal">href</code> property will download and display another web page's HTML content in a single pane in your application.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec111"/>AccordionPane</h3></div></div></div><p>One or more <code class="literal">AccordionPane</code><a id="id715" class="indexterm"/> panes are added within an <code class="literal">AccordionContainer</code> to display their<a id="id716" class="indexterm"/> content in a collapsible format. <code class="literal">AccordionPane</code> titles are stacked on top of each other and, as you click the titles, the content slides into view, covering the previously open <code class="literal">AccordionPane</code>. An <code class="literal">AccordionPane</code> otherwise exhibits the same functional behavior as a <code class="literal">ContentPane</code>.</p><p>Now that we've reviewed how the Dojo framework handles the application layout, let's look at using an alternative style framework.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec83"/>Bootstrap</h1></div></div></div><p>If you're<a id="id717" class="indexterm"/> looking for an alternative to Dojo's way of laying things out, you might consider Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a popular styling framework originally created by developers at Twitter. The story goes that the developers needed a way to release websites quickly, so they drafted a set of style sheets as a starting point for their projects. The styling templates proved very popular because they were easy to use and met the needs of most web developers. The template, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was later released in August 2011 as Bootstrap.</p><p>Bootstrap provides developers with responsive design styles that work well on both desktop and mobile browsers. Responsive grids can be fine-tuned to give you multi-column layouts that collapse to smaller sizes in smaller browser windows. Bootstrap provides stylish looking form elements, and buttons big enough for fat fingers on phone browsers. The framework provides easy to understand CSS classes, and the documentation and style sheets provide guidance on how to use the framework. From picture icons that can be understood across language barriers, to JavaScript plugins that create modal dialogs, tabs, carousels, and other elements we're used to on websites. Entire applications can be created using Bootstrap.</p><p>While Bootstrap styling doesn't require JavaScript libraries, all of the JavaScript plugins require jQuery to run. That is not very helpful for those of us using Dojo, but we do have an alternative.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec84"/>ESRI-Bootstrap</h1></div></div></div><p>Combining <a id="id718" class="indexterm"/>Bootstrap's ease of use and the compatibility with the ArcGIS JavaScript API, ESRI created ESRI-Bootstrap library (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js">https://github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js</a>). The style framework resizes maps and other elements just like Bootstrap, while many of the elements retain the same look and feel of a Bootstrap site. Dialogs don't run off the screen and elements respond to both mouse clicks and touches. Finally, ESRI Bootstrap can be used with either a combination of Dojo and jQuery, or Dojo alone.</p><p>We are going to add ESRI-Bootstrap on top of our Y2K application. You can use the <code class="literal">Dojo/jQuery</code> application we wrote in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Plays Well with Others">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Plays Well with Others</em>. We're going to use a pure Dojo application written in parallel with jQuery to show how you can add ESRI-Bootstrap to an application without jQuery.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec85"/>Restyling our app</h1></div></div></div><p>We<a id="id719" class="indexterm"/> recently let our intern create multiple copies of our application using other frameworks. While they were busy doing that, we decided to write the update using just the ArcGIS JavaScript API. The Y2K society checked out our app and approved our changes, but that wasn't all they had to say.</p><p>When we met with the Y2K society board, we found a critic in a new member of the board. They thought it looked okay, but it needed a more modern look. When asked for details, they showed us websites on their tablet that they thought looked good. All the sites we were shown had one thing in common, they were all built using Bootstrap. He managed to convince others on the board that our app needed to embrace this new style.</p><p>Going back to the drawing board, we looked at what ESRI had to offer. We decided to incorporate ESRI-Bootstrap into our application. It provides a modern feel.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec134"/>Adding ESRI-Bootstrap to our app</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's start <a id="id720" class="indexterm"/>by adding references to ESRI-Bootstrap to our application. The ESRI-Bootstrap <strong>Getting Started</strong> page tells us to download a ZIP file of the latest version published on GitHub. Click on the <strong>Download ZIP</strong> button on the right hand side of the GitHub page. Once downloaded, unzip the file.</p><p>We're primarily interested in the <code class="literal">bootstrapmap.js</code> and <code class="literal">bootstrapmap.css</code> files in the <code class="literal">src/js/</code> and <code class="literal">src/css/</code> folders, respectively. The rest of the files contain templates and samples that you can look at to see how they use Bootstrap with their maps. Copy these files into the <code class="literal">js</code> and <code class="literal">css</code> folders.</p><p>Next, we'll add the necessary references to the head tag of our <code class="literal">index.html</code> file. We can remove the <code class="literal">nihilo.css</code> external style sheet as we're no longer using the Dojo widgets to lay out our application, and add the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>…</strong>
<strong>&lt;link href="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" /&gt;</strong>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://js.arcgis.com/3.13/esri/css/esri.css" /&gt;
<strong>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/bootstrapmap.css" &gt;</strong>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/y2k.css" /&gt;
…</pre></div><p>Now that we have added the stylesheets, we need to add a reference to the Dojo version of bootstrap within our <code class="literal">dojoConfig</code> variable. The Dojo Bootstrap library, which covers features normally handled by jQuery, can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/xsokev/Dojo-Bootstrap">https://github.com/xsokev/Dojo-Bootstrap</a>, but we'll pull it from <a class="ulink" href="https://rawgit.com">https://rawgit.com</a>, which serves GitHub code directly. It should look as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">dojoConfig = {
<strong>     async: true,</strong>
  packages: [
    …
    {
      name: "d3",
      location: "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.4.12/"
    },
<strong>   {</strong>
<strong>      name: "bootstrap",</strong>
<strong>      location: "http://rawgit.com/xsokev/Dojo-Bootstrap/master"</strong>
<strong>   }</strong>
  ]
};</pre></div><p>Now that the head has been <a id="id721" class="indexterm"/>taken care of, it's time to overhaul the body.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec135"/>Bootstrapping our HTML</h2></div></div></div><p>Since <a id="id722" class="indexterm"/>ESRI-Bootstrap provides plenty of CSS styling and JavaScript, most of the work involves overhauling our HTML. We can start by removing the references to the Dojo layout widgets in the body of our main HTML page. You can remove the <code class="literal">class="nihilo"</code> from the <code class="literal">body</code> element, the <code class="literal">dijit/layout/BorderContainer</code> from the <code class="literal">#mainwindow div</code>, and all the <code class="literal">dijit/layout/ContentPane</code> references.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec112"/>Replacing the header with a navbar</h3></div></div></div><p>Our first job<a id="id723" class="indexterm"/> is to replace the header in the application. There are many ways you could start off a page like this but we'll use the Bootstrap <code class="literal">NavBar</code> in place of the header since the initial layout of the page was a full page app with no scrolling, You can see several examples of how to implement a <code class="literal">navbar</code> in HTML at <a class="ulink" href="http://getbootstrap.com">http://getbootstrap.com</a>.</p><p>We'll replace the header <code class="literal">div</code> with a <code class="literal">nav</code> element with the classes of <code class="literal">navbar</code> and <code class="literal">navbar-default</code> in the header. We'll add a <code class="literal">div</code> with the class of <code class="literal">container-fluid</code> inside that, since the size and appearance of its contents varies with different browsers. We'll add two <code class="literal">div</code> elements to the <code class="literal">container-fluid</code> div element. The first will have a class of <code class="literal">navbar-header</code>, and the second will have the classes of collapse and <code class="literal">navbar-collapse</code>.</p><p>We'll add a button to the <code class="literal">navbar-header</code> that will only appear when the browser is narrow enough. The button will have the classes of <code class="literal">navbar-toggle</code> and <code class="literal">collapsed</code>, plus a <code class="literal">data-toggle</code> attribute of collapse. This button will be floated to the far right when visible. The title of the map will go in a span next to the toggle button. This span will be given a class of <code class="literal">navbar-brand</code>.</p><p>We'll add the <a id="id724" class="indexterm"/>button that shows our <code class="literal">Census</code> dijit to the <code class="literal">navbar-collapse</code> div element. We'll add the <code class="literal">btn</code> classes (to make it a button), <code class="literal">btn-default</code> (to make it a default color), and <code class="literal">navbar-btn</code> (to make the button style fit in the <code class="literal">navbar</code>). When we are done, the HTML should look as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">…
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-default"&gt;
       &lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
      &lt;div class="navbar-header"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" 
         data-toggle="collapse" 
         data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1"&gt;
          &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Toggle navigation&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;span class="navbar-brand" &gt;Year 2000 Map&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse" 
        id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1"&gt;
        &lt;button id="census-btn" 
           class="btn btn-default navbar-btn"&gt;Census&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/nav&gt;
  …</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec113"/>Rearranging the map</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that <a id="id725" class="indexterm"/>the header has been redesigned, it's time to look at the rest of the page. We will want to pull the census widget location out of the map in order to incorporate a Bootstrap modal dialog. We can move the footer inside the map to make up the space lost in previous versions. We can define the map and related items below the header, as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>…</strong>
<strong>&lt;div class="modal fade" id="census-widget"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</strong>
<strong>&lt;div id="map"&gt;</strong>
<strong>  &lt;span id="footer"&gt;Courtesy of the Y2K Society&lt;/span&gt;</strong>
<strong>&lt;/div&gt;</strong>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="img/app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
…</pre></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec136"/>Restyling our app</h2></div></div></div><p>We'll <a id="id726" class="indexterm"/>need to manually restyle the page since we're removing all traces of Dojo's layout system. We can remove most of the styling references since they'll clash with the Bootstrap style. We'll keep the basic styling for the HTML and body tags, since they make the application a fullpage app. We'll also keep the styling for the <code class="literal">D3.js</code> graphs, but we can delete the rest of the styles.</p><p>We need to stretch the map from top to bottom and from end to end. If we don't, the map will be limited in its width and height. We can use absolute positioning to stretch the map across the page. We'll use the almost full page style we talked about earlier. Since the toolbar on the page is 50 pixels high (which you'll see when you experiment with the app), we'll set the top of the map to be <code class="literal">50px</code> from the top. The bottom, right, and left sides can positioned on the edges of the screen:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#map {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px; /* 50 pixels from the top */
  bottom: 0; /* all the way to the bottom */
  left: 0; /* left side 0 units from the left edge */
  right: 0; /* right side 0 units from the right edge */
}</pre></div><p>The other item we'll need to restyle is our footer element. We can position it at the bottom of the page, using the same technique we used on the map. We can also make the background semi-transparent, for a nice effect:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#footer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 5px; /* 5 pixels from the bottom */
  left: 5px; /* left side 5 pixels from the left edge */
  padding: 3px 5px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5); /* white, semitransparent */
}</pre></div><p>Once these styles have been applied, we can see a working example of our map. You can see an example of the map in the following picture:</p><div><img src="img/6459OT_08_01.jpg" alt="Restyling our app" width="826" height="542"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec137"/>Making our Census dijit modal</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that <a id="id727" class="indexterm"/>our page has been transformed into a Bootstrap application, we need to add the same to our <code class="literal">Census</code> dijit. We need to tap into Bootstrap's modal widgets to imitate the effect of our floating dialog.</p><p>Open the <code class="literal">Census.html</code> file in the <code class="literal">js/templates/</code> folder. In the base <code class="literal">div</code> element, add the classes <code class="literal">modal</code> and <code class="literal">fade</code>. The <code class="literal">modal</code> class tells Bootstrap that this will be a modal dialog, while <code class="literal">fade</code> describes how the element will hide and show. We'll also add a data-backdrop attribute to the element and set it to <code class="literal">static</code>. This will create the generic modal dialog that keeps the rest of the page from being clicked while it's open. In this case, we'll abandon the idea that closing the widget will turn off the map's click events:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div class="${baseClass} modal fade" 
  style="display: none;" data-backdrop="static"&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><p>We'll add several more <code class="literal">div</code> elements to the base <code class="literal">div</code> to define the modal and the heading. One level inside our modal class, we'll add a <code class="literal">div</code> element with the classes of <code class="literal">modal-dialog</code> and <code class="literal">modal-sm</code>. The <code class="literal">modal-dialog</code> class defines the style for the modal, while <code class="literal">modal-sm</code> makes the modal smaller. Removing <code class="literal">modal-sm</code> creates a dialog that stretches across larger screens.</p><p>We'll create a <code class="literal">div</code> with the class <code class="literal">modal-content</code> in the <code class="literal">div</code> with the <code class="literal">modal-dialog</code> class, and two <code class="literal">div</code> elements inside that, with the classes of <code class="literal">modal-header</code> and <code class="literal">modal-body</code>, respectively. We'll add our closing button and our title to the <code class="literal">modal-header</code> div. We'll add the text and select dropdowns for the rest of our dijit to the <code class="literal">modal-body</code> div:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div class="${baseClass} modal fade" 
  style="display: none;" data-backdrop="static"&gt;
  &lt;div class="<strong>modal-dialog modal-sm</strong>"&gt;
    &lt;div class="<strong>modal-content</strong>"&gt;
      &lt;div class="<strong>modal-header</strong>"&gt;
      …
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="<strong>modal-body</strong>"&gt;
      …
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><p>We'll replace<a id="id728" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">dijit</code> closing event with Bootstrap's modal closing event in the <code class="literal">modal-header</code> div. We'll add a class of <code class="literal">close</code> to the button, and a <code class="literal">data-dismiss</code> attribute of modal. Most Bootstrap examples also include ARIA attributes to handle screen readers and other accessibility tools, so we'll add an <code class="literal">aria-hidden</code> value of <code class="literal">true</code> so that screen-readers do not read aloud the <em>X</em> that we place in that. For the title, we'll surround the <code class="literal">Census</code> data in a span with the class of <code class="literal">modal-title</code>. It should look like the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">…
&lt;div class="<strong>modal-header</strong>"&gt;
  &lt;button type="button" class="close" 
    data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true"&gt;x&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;span class="<strong>modal-title</strong>"&gt;Census Data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
…</pre></div><p>We'll add our description paragraph to the <code class="literal">modal-body</code> div and format the select elements so that they appear as form elements. We'll add the class <code class="literal">form-group</code> to the <code class="literal">div</code> elements that surround our select dropdowns. This lines up the content and adds proper spacing and formatting. We'll replace the <code class="literal">b</code> tags with <code class="literal">label</code> tags, and add the <code class="literal">control-label</code> class. We'll add the <code class="literal">form-control</code> class to the select element. This stretches the <code class="literal">select</code> dropdown across the width of the dialog. Our HTML should look as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">…
&lt;div class="<strong>modal-body</strong>"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Click on a location in the United States to view 
    the census data for that region. You can also use 
    the dropdown tools to select a State, County, or 
    Blockgroup.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="<strong>form-group</strong>" &gt;
    &lt;label class="<strong>control-label</strong>"&gt;State Selector: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select class="<strong>form-control</strong>"
      data-dojo-attach-point='stateSelect' 
      data-dojo-attach-event='change:_stateSelectChanged'&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="<strong>form-group</strong>"&gt;
    &lt;label class="<strong>control-label</strong>"&gt;County Selector: &lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;select class="<strong>form-control</strong>" 
       data-dojo-attach-point='countySelect' 
      data-dojo-attach-event='change:_countySelectChanged'&gt;
     &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="<strong>form-group</strong>"&gt;
    &lt;label class="<strong>control-label</strong>"&gt;
      Block Group Selector: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select class="<strong>form-control</strong>" 
      data-dojo-attach-point='blockGroupSelect' 
      data-dojo-attach-event='change:_blockGroupSelectChanged'&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
…</pre></div><p>We'll add a<a id="id729" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">div</code> with the class of <code class="literal">modal-footer</code> to our <code class="literal">modal-body</code> div. Here, we can add another button to dismiss the dialog, just in case the user doesn't notice the <em>x</em> in the upper corner. We'll format the dismiss button by adding the classes <code class="literal">btn</code> and <code class="literal">btn-default</code>, affecting the shape and color, in that order. We'll also add our <code class="literal">data-dismiss</code> attribute and set it equal to <code class="literal">modal</code>. It should look as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">  …
    <strong>&lt;div class="modal-footer"&gt;</strong>
<strong>      &lt;button id="btnDismiss" type="button" </strong>
<strong>        class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal"&gt;</strong>
<strong>        Dismiss</strong>
<strong>      &lt;/button&gt;</strong>
<strong>    &lt;/div&gt;</strong>
  &lt;/div&gt;
  …</pre></div><p>Once the widget HTML is properly formatted, the application should look like the following image. Notice the dropdowns and buttons with wide spacing, which makes it easier to click on them on a smaller mobile device:</p><div><img src="img/6459OT_08_02.jpg" alt="Making our Census dijit modal" width="825" height="539"/></div><p>Now that the<a id="id730" class="indexterm"/> application is functionally complete, we can modify parts of it to create our own look and feel. Remember, Bootstrap was meant to be a starting point for creating a website. It doesn't have to be the end result. We can still change colors and other features to make the application our own.</p></div></div></div></div>
