<p>We live in an ever-changing world. New infrastructure is added, old infrastructure is removed, regulations change, new needs are discovered, and so on. Our GIS must be able to keep up with these changes so that it accurately reflects the world we live in as closely as possible. This means we must be able to quickly and easily make changes to our GIS data, both spatial and tabular.</p>
<p> ArcGIS Pro provides a wealth of tools and methods you can use to make updates to your data. The tools available to you and the types of data you can edit or update will largely depend on the license level you have. For example, if you only have a Basic license, you are not able to edit data in an SDE geodatabase. However, you can edit a shapefile or feature classes in a file geodatabase. Here is a quick list of the data formats you can edit and at which license level:</p>

<p>ArcGIS Pro does not support the personal geodatabase at all and most likely never will. Esri has decided to replace the personal geodatabase with the file geodatabase because it provides much better performance. ArcGIS Pro Basic will allow you to edit data stored in a file geodatabase as long as it is not part of a topology or geometric network.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro cannot edit any data that is included in a Geometric Network. However, ArcGIS Pro 2.1 does support the newer Utility Network which was just released in its initial version in December 2017. The Utility Network provides similar functionality to the Geometric Network but is designed to be used in conjunction with the Utility Network Management extension for ArcGIS Enterprise. So it appears that the Utility Network will completely replace the older Geometric Network model. You can learn more about the Utility Network and the Management extension by going to <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-utility-network-management/overview">https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-utility-network-management/overview</a>. </p>
<p>An ArcGIS Pro Basic license will not allow you to edit data stored in an SDE Geodatabase either. SDE stands for Spatial Database Engine and provides multiple user capability for a Geodatabase. SDE Geodatabases require you to have ArcGIS Enterprise (formerly known as ArcGIS Server). With a Basic license, you can only view data in an SDE Geodatabase but not edit it. For more information about the different types of geodatabases, go to <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geodatabases/types-of-geodatabases.htm">http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geodatabases/types-of-geodatabases.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Shapefiles and DBF tables can be edited without any restrictions at all license levels. CAD files and spreadsheets can only be viewed in ArcGIS Pro and cannot be edited without converting them to a different format.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to configure various editing options and use multiple tools. You will get to experience workflows for editing existing features as well as creating new features. Lastly, you will learn different methods for editing attributes and tables.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that ArcGIS Pro has an autosave feature for edits. This is something new in ArcGIS Pro and if enabled can reduce the need to remember to manually save.</p>
<p>When editing, you need to ensure you save your edits frequently to avoid losing work if your computer crashes, locks up, or loses power. Unlike other applications, ArcGIS Pro does not create a restorable copy of your edits. The only way to ensure your edits are persistent is to save them.</p>
<p>The reason for this is ArcGIS Pro never really works directly with the data you see in a map or table. Instead, ArcGIS Pro determines what features are visible and loads those into your computer memory. This will change as you move within a map or table. This allows ArcGIS to work with large datasets which would cause other applications to slow or crash. You never open or load the entire database at one time. You only see what you need. This also means your edits are only stored in your computer’s memory. They are not actually committed back to the source data until you save your edits. <strong>So make sure to save often!</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have the various editing options set, it is time to start actually editing data. Unlike the older ArcMap application that preceded ArcGIS Pro, there is no need to start and stop editing. You can start editing data at any time.  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will reshape the City Limit boundary to reflect a recent annexation. You will need to ensure the City Limits layer is editable, snappable, and selectable. You will then draw a sketch using various construction tools that will represent a change to the City Limits boundary.   </p>

<p>Another difference between ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro when editing is the number of workspaces you can edit at one time. A workspace is a location that stores data such as a geodatabase, folder, or web service. In ArcGIS Pro, you are not limited to editing data in a single workspace at a time.

<p>If you don’t enable the autosave feature in ArcGIS Pro, you will want to make sure you save often, otherwise you will lose any edits you have not saved if ArcGIS Pro or your computer crashes.</p>

<li>Save your project. If you are continuing to the next recipe, keep ArcGIS Pro open. If not, you may close ArcGIS Pro.</li>

<p>In this recipe, you reshaped the City Limits boundary for the City of Trippville so that it included a newly annexed parcel. The first thing you needed to do in order to perform this edit was to set which layer you wanted to have as selectable and editable. You did this through the lists in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> tab.</p>
<p>When editing data, remember that data can be selectable but not editable, editable but not selectable, both, or neither. If you need to edit a feature by first selecting it from the map, as you did in this recipe, you need the layer to be both selectable and editable. If you select the feature for editing using an <span class="packt_screen">Attribute</span> query, the layer does not need to be selectable. Setting a layer as selectable in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane only applies when performing an interactive selection in the map.</p>
<p>Using the Trace tool allowed you to edit the City Limit boundary so that it followed the parcel boundary exactly. The Trace tool automatically copies the geometry of the feature you are tracing to the new shape so it is an exact duplicate. This ensures your data is clean and accurate. It reduces errors such as overlaps and gaps which can impact the results of analysis and measurements.  </p>

<p>Polygons are not the only type of feature you may need to split. Lines often need to be split as you add other features to the same layer to maintain the correct connections. Lines often form a network used to travel across, such as roads, railroads, sidewalks, and trails. Travel is not limited to transportation. Utilities also use linear features to move water, sewer, electricity, and communications from one point to another. Other systems such as emergency dispatch systems rely on linear data from GIS as well. So, it is extremely important that we maintain these layers correctly.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, ArcGIS Pro 2.0 and earlier versions do not currently support geometric networks that are commonly used by utilities. If you have the Network Analyst extension, ArcGIS Pro will allow you to use, create, and maintain a Network Dataset. Esri has indicated that support for geometric networks will not be added in a future release of ArcGIS Pro. In ArcGIS Pro 2.1, they added support for the new Utility Network. <br/>
In this recipe, you will draw new sewer lines based on a scanned and georeferenced plot. Once you draw the new sewer lines, you will split them where they connect to manholes, as shown on the plot, so you can get accurate measurements of each section of sewer line between the manholes.</p>

<li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro before starting this recipe, you will need to start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>Editing.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter4\Editing</kbd> using the skills you learned in previous recipes. </li>
<li> In order to add the scanned plot, which will serve as the source data for adding the new sewer lines, you will need to add a folder connection to your project. In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Folders</span> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">Add Folder Connection</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<li>Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Forrest Park Subdivision.jpg</span> file and select <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span>. The file should now appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Content</span> pane as a layer in the map.</li>
<li>Right-click on the newly added <span class="packt_screen">Forrest Park Subdivision</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Zoom to Layer</span> from the context menu that appears, as shown in the following screenshot:

You are now zoomed in to the location of the subdivision. However, you are not able to see it because the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer is obscuring it. You will need to make a quick adjustment to the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer so you can see it.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane.</li>

</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">I find it helpful to close panes such as the <span class="packt_screen">Symbology</span> pane when I am done using them. This limits the number you have open and the amount of screen space they take up. It also helps keep them from becoming lost in a stack of panes, which often happens if you don’t manage the number of panes you have open. Another way to manage panes is to undock them and place them on a secondary monitor. This frees up screen space on your primary display while still making items easy to locate. I recommend that you keep the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> panes open at all times.</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now see the scanned plot you added to your map. It should appear in the location where a new subdivision is being built.

<div class="packt_infobox">Layer files allow you to add layers to a map, that already have their properties predefined. This includes properties such as symbology, labels, scale ranges, definition queries, and others. Layer files allow you to establish consistent display settings for layers so they look and behave the same way in multiple maps.<br/>
Layer files created in ArcGIS Pro have a <kbd>.lyrx</kbd> file extension. Those created in ArcMap have a <kbd>.lyr</kbd> file extension. ArcGIS Pro can make use of both. However, layer files created with ArcGIS Pro are version dependent. This means layer files created with ArcGIS Pro 2.0 are not compatible with previous versions but new versions of ArcGIS Pro can make use of layer files created with earlier versions.

<p>You now know how to split and reshape features, but not all edits you may need to make will be limited to these. Sometimes you need to combine two or more existing features together. This might be done to simplify a layer for easier analysis or to reflect a change to the real-world features, such as someone buying two adjacent parcels to combine them into a single parcel.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you have found a road centerline, which is split into many unnecessary segments. This is causing issues when trying to calculate the total length of each road. You need to merge these segments together.  </p>

<p>As you saw in this recipe, you merged three center line segments into one single segment. This simplifies the layer by reducing the total number of features, which makes it easier to analyze and maintain. The merge tool allows you to replace existing features or create a new feature while leaving the existing features in place. This option is accessed by clicking on one of the two tabs located at the top of the tool, Existing Feature or New Feature. The Existing Feature option replaces the selected features with a new feature that has the attributes of one of the selected features. The New Feature option creates a brand new feature and leaves the selected features in place as well. You can merge any type of feature as long as the features are in the same layer.</p>
<p>When using the Existing Feature option, as you did in this recipe, you get to select which selected feature the newly created feature will inherit. This is done by clicking on the feature in the Features to merge grid. The feature that is listed as preserved is the one that the new feature will inherit.  </p>

<p>ArcGIS Pro can be a very valuable tool for performing analysis. But the results of any analysis is only as good as the quality of the data used. The adage of garbage in, garbage out certainly applies.</p>
<p>So, it is extremely important that our data is as clean as possible. This means we need to remove unwanted gaps or overlaps within our data. ArcGIS Pro has several tools to help you clean up your data. One of those is the Align Features tool. This tool is available with all license levels.  </p>
<p>In <span> the previous </span>recipe, you located an area where two parcels overlap and where the City Limits are supposed to follow their common boundary. You will use the Align Features tool to fix this error in your data.</p>

<li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro before starting this recipe, you will need to start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>Editing.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter4\Editing</kbd> using the skills you learned in previous recipes.</li>
<li>Activate the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Bookmarks</span> button. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Align Features</span> bookmark to zoom into the area where the data error exists.</li>
<li>You should see the City Limits and a parcel boundary, which appear to create a sliver or gap. Turn off the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> so you can see the parcel boundaries by clicking on the checkbox next to the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer, as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><strong><img height="245" src="assets/591f5783-6766-462e-9e1c-e6b3488d3a50.png" width="296"/></strong></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now you need to determine whether this is a gap or overlap. In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, click on the List by Selection button located near the top of the pane. The icon looks like three polygons, with one of them being blue.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Make this the only selectable layer</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Choose the <span class="packt_screen">Select</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Do the two parcels overlap or have a gap between them?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">After clicking on both parcels, you should see that they overlap one another. Parcels should not overlap one another. Land owners tend to get upset if this happens. So you need to remove this overlap so that your data provides a more realistic representation of the parcel boundaries. The City Limits boundary should also follow the common boundary formed between the two parcels, so you will need to ensure it is adjusted as well:</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Clear</span> button located in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the ribbon. This will deselect all selected features.</li>
<li>Turn the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer back on so you can see it on the map. To do this, click on the <span class="packt_screen">List by Drawing Order</span> button at the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane. It is the first button on the left. Then, click on the box located to the left of the layer name.</li>
<li>Click on the List by Selection button at the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane.</li>
<li>Click on the box next to the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits Layer</span> so that the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> and <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer are both selectable, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see that both parcels and the City Limits are selected. If you are not sure, you can go back to the <span class="packt_screen">List by Selection</span> option in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane to verify. It will show you how many features in each layer you have selected.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>When editing, it is recommended to keep the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane on the List by <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> option as much as possible. This allows you to track how many features are on the layers you have selected. This information can stop you from accidentally editing or deleting features you do not intend to. This is a lesson I have learned the hard way. Remember, you cannot undo an edit once you have saved the edits you have performed.</p>

<ol start="23">
<li>Click on the northernmost intersection of the two parcels in question and the City Limit, as shown in the following screenshot shown after <em>step 24</em>. You should automatically snap to the intersection if you set your snapping locations properly.</li>
<li>Then click on each location, as shown in the following screenshot. When you get to the Endpoint, you may either double-click to finish the sketch or single click and press the <em>F2</em> key:</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you traced the alignment line correctly, all three features should have been edited so that they all now line up properly and there is no longer any overlap. So, this single tool allowed you to correct and edit three features on two different layers at one time. This is much more efficient than editing each one individually:</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Clear</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab to deselect all the features you have selected.</li>
<li>Using the <span class="packt_screen">Select</span> tool on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab, click on one of the two parcels you selected earlier. You should notice it now aligns with the adjacent parcel and no longer has an overlap. To verify the overlap is gone, click on the other parcel.</li>
<li>Clear your selection again using the same method as in <em>step 25</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Edits</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab in the ribbon to save the edits you just completed. When asked to confirm the save, click <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span>.</li>
<li>If you are not continuing to the next recipe, save your project and close ArcGIS Pro. If you are continuing, leave ArcGIS Pro and the editing project open.</li>

<p>Now that you have seen the Align Features tool in action, how does it work? It will adjust line and polygon features so that they share coincident locations. This means the vertices of the lines and polygons that are adjusted end up being in the same exact locations.</p>
<p>Selecting the features tells the tool which ones will be adjusted. Alignment Tolerance provides a value to account for the distance difference between the features you wish to adjust. It will only adjust the portions of the features that are within the tolerance distance you specify. This prevents you from making undesired changes to your data.</p>
<p>Then you can start drawing a sketch that represents the stitch line to which all selected items are adjusted. You can choose which side of the stitch line you wish to adjust and how to handle the end of the stitch line.</p>
<p>The Align Feature tool automatically defaults to using the Trace construction tool. This allows you to easily follow an existing feature exactly, because you are tracing its form. This is what you did in the recipe. However, you can use any of the construction tools, such as Line, Perpendicular, or any of the Curve tools to create the stitch line.</p>
<p>Once you create the stitch line, ArcGIS Pro will automatically adjust the selected features to match the stitch line. It will either extend or trim line features and subtract or add to polygon features.</p>

<p>So far, you have been editing existing features. You have realigned, reshaped, merged, and split them. Now it is time to look at how these features were created to begin with. We will start with the simplest of features, a point.</p>
<p>A point identifies an object at a single location. It is stored and located using a single coordinate pair. A coordinate pair consists of one <em>x</em> and one <em>y</em> coordinate. It is also possible for a point to have a <em>z</em> coordinate that normally represents its elevation.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create several new point features. You will start by adding the manholes that are in the new subdivision you were looking at in the recipe on splitting lines earlier in this chapter.  </p>

<p>Now we will move onto creating Line features. These are more complicated because they require multiple vertices. At minimum, a line requires two vertices: a beginning and an ending. It is not uncommon for a Line feature to have multiple vertices. This is called a polyline.</p>
<p>As far as ArcGIS is concerned, a line and polyline are the same thing. They are stored together in the same feature classes and the tools used to create them are the same. So you will see the term line and polyline used interchangeably within ArcGIS. This is not true of all applications, such as AutoCAD. </p>
<p>Line features stored in a geodatabase feature class can also include curved segments. These segments are stored and created as arcs. Not all data storage formats support arcs. Shapefile is a good example of one that does not support arcs. Instead of using arcs, shapefile typically uses multiple very short straight segments to simulate the arc. When displayed to scale, these short straight segments appear to be a curve. Geodatabases and CAD formats (DWG, DXF, and DGN) do support true arcs.</p>
<p>There are many construction techniques for creating line features. You can simply digitize the vertices by clicking with your mouse, you can specify exact measurements, or enter coordinates. Which method will work best <span>will depend on the source data you have and its quality.</span></p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create several new Line features that represent the street centerlines for the new Forrest Park Subdivision. You will use various construction techniques to do this.   </p>

<p>The QB next to the direction stands for <strong>Quadrant Bearing</strong>. This is a type of measurement commonly used by surveyors and engineers to identify direction. Quadrant Bearings divide the compass into four quadrants, north-east, south-east, south-west, and north-west. Then, the direction within that quadrant is measured based on the angle from either due north or due south to a maximum of 90 degrees. So, a feature heading directly due east could be identified as either north 90 east or south 90 east.  Typically, the measurements are shown using degrees, minutes, and seconds as opposed to decimal degrees. In the example used in this recipe, 47 is the degrees, 6 is the minutes, and 50 is the seconds within the north-west quadrant.</p>

<p>You can select multiple features using several methods. The first is to click on each individual feature while holding down your <em>Shift</em> key. The other is to draw a rectangle by clicking in one location and dragging a box while holding down your mouse button. This will normally select all features that are either inside or touched by the rectangle you create. If you click on the drop-down arrow located below the <span class="packt_screen">Select</span> tool, you can choose to create other shapes including, a polygon, circle, line, or lasso (free hand), or trace existing features.  </p>

<p>ArcGIS Pro contains several buffer tools. The one you have just used is the edit Buffer tool. It will create new polygon or line features depending on which template is selected. This tool only creates new features on existing layers. In addition to the edit Buffer tool, there are several buffer geoprocessing tools, which are most often used when performing spatial analysis. These include Buffer, Multi-ring Buffer, and Graphic Buffer. The Buffer and Multi-ring Buffer create completely new polygon feature classes and do not actually edit any existing layers. </p>

<p>You've learned how to create point and line features using ArcGIS Pro. It is now time to learn how to create polygon features. Polygons are very similar to polylines in that they consist of multiple vertices. The big difference is that a polygon must form a closed figure and a polyline does not.</p>
<p>A polygon is constructed with a minimum of four vertices. This may seem confusing, as a triangle is a polygon but only has three sides. So why are four vertices required? Well, that is because the polygon must be closed. So, the first and last vertices are in the exact same location. When creating new polygons in ArcGIS Pro, the software automatically does this. So, you never have to worry about whether your polygon is closed or not.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create polygons that represent building footprints. You will use several different methods to do this. Many will be similar to the methods you used to create lines.    </p>

<p>Before starting this recipe, you will need to have completed the <em>Configuring editing options</em> recipe. It is recommended that you complete the <em>Creating new line features</em> recipe as well, though it is not required. However, completing that recipe will help teach you some of the tools and skills you will also need to create new polygons. This recipe can be completed with all licensing levels of ArcGIS Pro. You will also need to ensure you have internet access in order to make use of the Esri provided basemaps.</p>

<p>You now know how to create new polygon features that are not connected or adjacent to other polygons. How do you create new polygon features that are adjacent to other existing polygon features? You would want to construct these in a way that would not create gaps or overlaps between the new polygon and existing ones. Using the Autocomplete tool is one way to successfully do this.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a new parcel polygon located just outside the City Limits of Trippville. The City Council is considering annexing this parcel and wants to see how it relates to the existing city limits. You will create the new parcel using the Autocomplete tool.    </p>

<p>When creating polygons that represent features such as parcels, political boundaries, emergency response boundaries, and others, it is important to create them in such a way to ensure they do not have overlaps and gaps. The Autocomplete tool is a great way to ensure the new polygons you create follow existing boundaries exactly. This means they do not have gaps or overlaps.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you created a new parcel polygon by defining three of four sides using traditional methods you learned in other recipes in this chapter. The fourth side was automatically created because the Autocomplete tool traces the boundary of the adjoining existing parcel automatically.</p>
<p>When using the Autocomplete tool, you need to ensure the sketch you create starts and ends by touching or crossing the boundary of the existing adjacent polygon. If your sketch does not touch or cross the existing adjacent boundary, the tool will fail to create a new polygon.</p>

<p>In the previous recipes in this chapter, you learned how to edit and create new spatial features. However, that is only half of the data. Each feature also has attribute information linked to it. It is equally important to ensure you keep the attributes up to date.  </p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro provides multiple methods you can use to update the attributes associated with features in your GIS. In this recipe, you will learn how to us the Attribute pane to update the values associated with features. You will update the attributes for the road centerlines you added in previous recipes.</p>

<p>Generally, it is best to update the attribute values for new features as you create them. That way, you do not forget to make the necessary updates to the attributes, which are just as important in a GIS as in the spatial data.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have now edited attribute values for individual features in the Attributes pane. What if you have several features which all need to be assigned the same attribute value? You can do them individually just as you have been, but there is a more effective way. You will now learn how to do that by updating the pipe material for the sewer pipes you created in a previous recipe:</p>
<ol start="19">

<li>Click at a location to the south-east of all the sewer lines in the new subdivision and then drag your mouse pointer to the north-west while holding down your mouse button. Release it once you have drawn a rectangle that encompasses all the sewer lines you drew in the previous recipe, as illustrated in the following diagram:</li>

<ol start="25">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Attributes</span> pane, you should see four features selected in the top panel. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Sewer Line</span> located above the four selected features in the top panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Attributes</span> pane.</li>

<p>In the last recipe, you learned how to update attribute values using the Attributes pane. You experienced editing attributes for individual features and multiple features. This is just one way you can edit attributes.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro also allows you to edit attributes directly in the table when you view the attribute table of the entire layer. Like the Attributes pane, you can edit individually or for multiple features at one time. When editing attributes for individual features, the workflow is very similar to editing in the Attributes pane. To edit the values for multiple features, you will need to use a new tool, Calculate Field.</p>
<p>The Calculate Field tool is very powerful. It allows you to create expressions or formulas that are used to calculate the values, which are then populated into the field. These expressions can be very simple or complex. Complex expressions must be written using Python. Python is the primary scripting language for ArcGIS.    </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will update attributes for individual features in the Table view. You will then use the Calculate Field tool to calculate the length in miles for the new roads you drew in previous exercises.</p>

<li>Click on one of the sewer lines you added in the <em>Splitting a line feature</em> recipe.</li>
<li>While holding down your <em>Shift</em> key, click on the remaining sewer lines you created in the <em>Splitting a line feature</em> recipe until they are all selected, as shown in the following diagram. You should have four sewer lines selected:</li>

<li>In the table view, right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Material</span> field name. Select <span class="packt_screen">Calculate Field</span> from the menu that appears, as shown in the screenshot. This opens the <span class="packt_screen">Calculate Field</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane:</li>

<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Input Table</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">Sewer Lines</span>. It should automatically be set because you evoked the tool from that table.</li>
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Field Name</span> is set to <kbd>MATERIAL</kbd>. Again, this should automatically be set.</li>
<li>Under <span class="packt_screen">Expression</span>, below the <span class="packt_screen">Fields</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Helpers</span> panels, locate where it says <span class="packt_screen">MATERIAL =</span> and the cell below that. Type the following into the cell: <kbd>"DI”</kbd>. Your <span class="packt_screen">Calculate Field</span> tool should look like the following screenshot:</li>

<ol start="29">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Validate</span> button located at the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane. It should look like a green check mark.</li>
<li>If the validation says <span class="packt_screen">Expression is valid</span>, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Run</span> button. If the validation gives you an error, review the error and fix it. The most common error is not including the double quotation marks around the DI value.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>If you run the Calculate Field tool without any features selected, it will populate new values for all records in the table based on the value or expression you inputted into the tool. In this recipe, you had four sewer lines selected, so only those four had their material values changed. If you had not selected those four and had run the Calculate Field tool, it would have changed the material value for all the sewer lines in the layer to DI.</p>
</div>
<ol start="31">
<li>You should see the material value for each selected sewer line change from <span class="packt_screen">PVC</span> to <span class="packt_screen">DI</span>. Save your edits if the values changed correctly.</li>
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you know how to populate a simple value into multiple features, it is time to look at a way to create a simple expression. You will calculate the length of each road segment in miles using the shape length field as the base. This field shows the length of each segment in US feet.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Clear</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab on the ribbon.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Street_Centerlines</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute</span> Table. The attribute table for the layer should open in the table view.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Leng_Miles</span> field in the table view and select the <span class="packt_screen">Calculate Field</span> tool from the menu that appears.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You will notice that the field already contains values. However, this is not a default field; you want to ensure the values are current and correct.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Input Table</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">Street_Centerline</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">Field Name</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">Leng_Miles</span>. This should be automatically set because you right-clicked on the <span class="packt_screen">Leng_Miles</span> field in the <span class="packt_screen">Street_Centerlines</span> table.</li>
<li>Locate the cell below <span class="packt_screen">Leng_Miles =</span>. It should be below the <span class="packt_screen">Fields</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Helpers</span> panel. Type in the following: <kbd>!Shape_Length!/5280</kbd>. This will divide the value in the <span class="packt_screen">Shape_length</span> field for each feature by 5,280, which is the number of feet in a mile.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>When creating expressions, syntax is extremely important. In this expression, the shape length field is identified as such using exclamation marks. To help reduce the risk of syntax errors, you could just locate the <span class="packt_screen">Shape_Length</span> field in the <span class="packt_screen">Fields</span> panel and double-click on it to add it to the expression with the proper syntax.

<li>Validate your expression by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Validate</span> button located near the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
<li>If the validation is successful, click the <span class="packt_screen">Run</span> button. If the validation returns an error, fix it and revalidate.</li>
<li>Activate the <span class="packt_screen">Select</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab on the ribbon.</li>
<li>Select the street center line for Oak Place.</li>
<li>In the table view, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Show Selected Records</span> button located at the bottom.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now see only the record in the table for Oak Place. The value for the <span class="packt_screen">Leng_Miles</span> field is now populated with a value of approximately half a mile. It was populated by the Calculate Field tool you just ran. The tool not only populated the value for the new roads you added in previous recipes, but it also updated the values for all the street centerlines in the layer:</p>
