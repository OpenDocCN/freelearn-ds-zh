- en: Apache Storm is a powerful framework for creating complex workflows that ingest
    and process huge amounts of data. With its generic concepts of spouts and bolts,
    along with simple deployment and monitoring tools, it allows developers to focus
    on the specifics of their workflow without reinventing the wheel.

- en: However, Storm is written in Java. While it supports other programming languages
    besides Java, the tools are incomplete and there is little documentation and few
    examples.

- en: One of the authors of this book created Petrel, the first framework that supports
    the creation of Storm topologies in 100 percent Python. He has firsthand experience
    with the struggles of building a Python Storm topology on the Java tool set. This
    book closes this gap, providing a resource to help Python developers of all experience
    levels in building their own applications using Storm.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Acquainted with Storm"), *Getting
    Acquainted with Storm*, provides detailed information about Storm''s use cases,
    different installation modes, and configuration in Storm.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The Storm Anatomy"), *The Storm Anatomy*,
    tells you about Storm-specific terminologies, processes, fault tolerance in Storm,
    tuning parallelism in Storm, and guaranteed tuple processing, with detailed explanations
    about each of these.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Introducing Petrel"), *Introducing Petrel*,
    introduces a framework called Petrel for building Storm topologies in Python.
    This chapter walks through the installation of Petrel and includes a simple example.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Example Topology – Twitter"), *Example Topology
    – Twitter*, provides an in-depth example of a topology that computes statistics
    on Twitter data in real time. The example introduces the use of tick tuples, which
    are useful for topologies that need to compute statistics or do other things on
    a schedule. In this chapter, you also see how topologies can access configuration
    data.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Persistence Using Redis and MongoDB"), *Persistence
    Using Redis and MongoDB*, updates the sample Twitter topology for the use of Redis,
    a popular key-value store. It shows you how to simplify the complex Python calculation
    logic with built-in Redis operations. The chapter concludes with an example of
    storing Twitter data in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, and using its aggregation
    capabilities to generate reports.'

    teaches practical skills that will make developers more productive using Storm.
    You learn how to use Petrel to create automated tests for your spout and bolt
    components that run outside of Storm. You also see how to use a graphical debugger
    to debug a topology running inside Storm.'
