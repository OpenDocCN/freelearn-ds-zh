    the analytical power ArcGIS Pro brings to the table. You have seen how it can
    be used to find features that are near one another and calculate those distances
    in addition to other attributes. But what if you are not looking to find just
    the closest feature or calculate how far features are from one another? What if
    you want to determine whether there are any spatial clusters in your data, to
    see whether there is some pattern or possible point of origin?

- en: This type of analysis is often called Cluster or Hot Spot analysis. It uses
    various methods to determine the spatial distribution of data and associated values,
    so you can see clusters, determine center points, directional distribution, and
    more. This is done by calculating spatial statistics that can be weighted by other
    attributes, such as size, total amounts, or counts.

    These are all stored in the Spatial Statistics toolbox and divided between five
    different toolsets, including Analyzing Patterns, Mapping Clusters, Measuring
    Geographic Distributions, Modeling Spatial Relationships, and Utilities. All but
    a couple of the tools in this toolbox work with the core ArcGIS Pro product at
    all license levels. This means that even with a Basic license, you can perform
    some pretty amazing analysis.

    statistics and hot spot analysis tools that are in ArcGIS Pro. You will perform
    a hot spot analysis to determine which areas in a city have experienced the most
    damage or loss due to crime. This will help the city determine where it might
    want to focus law enforcement activities.

    geographic distribution of our data, one of the first things many of these tools
    do is determine a center of mass for the data. From there, it can compare nearby
    features looking for clusters, determine area concentrations of data, look at
    directional distribution, and more.

    be a powerful analytical tool. This can allow us to strategically locate new facilities,
    pick a central meeting place, plan a reaction to events, and more. There are three
    types of centers we can calculate: mean, feature, and median.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mean Center is the easiest to calculate. It is simply the average of all
    the *x* and *y* coordinates for all features in the layer you are analyzing. The
    result is the mean center. This can be useful in tracking movement or shifts over
    time, such as population shifts from urban to suburban areas. You might also use
    this to locate a good place to hold a meeting that would be centrally-located
    for all attendees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Median Center is sometimes referred to as the Minimum Distance center. Simply
    put, it is the coordinate pair that represents the location closest to all features
    in a given layer. Areas will automatically be weighted by the number of features
    present. Those with a large number of features will pull the median center toward
    them more than those with fewer features. This can be useful in locating new facilities
    that may rely on other structures for support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Center Feature locates an existing feature that is closest to all other
    features. This might be helpful if you are looking for a location that would be
    centrally-located to other facilities. For example, you are planning training
    for firefighters. You want to hold it at an existing fire station because they
    have the equipment you need for the training. The Center Feature would allow you
    to locate the fire station that would be closest to the other stations.

    As you have seen, this can be very useful to help locate new structures, event
    sites, and so on. It can also be used to compare two sets of data to see whether
    there is a shift or movement over time. But what if you need to know what feature
    within a group is the most central? Can you do that?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can do this using the Center Feature tool. This tool is in the Spatial Statistics
    Tools toolbox and the Measuring Geographic Distributions toolset. The Central
    Feature tool identifies the most central feature in a point, line, or polygon
    in the input feature class. It does this by calculating the distances from the
    centroid of each feature to every other feature’s centroid. Once that has been
    calculated, the tool selects the feature that has the shortest distance to all
    other features and copies it to a new output feature class. The shortest distance
    calculation will honor Z (elevation) coordinates as well, if they exist. Like
    the Mean and Median Center tools, you can also use a Weight and Case field if
    desired. This tool works best with a projected coordinate system. Use of a geographic
    coordinate system can skew the results due to the inconsistency of the units.
    To learn more about the specifics of how this tool calculates the center feature,
    go to [http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-central-feature-spatial-statistics-works.htm](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-central-feature-spatial-statistics-works.htm).

- en: It would appear that the Police Chief is correct. The data does show that the
    concentration of crimes does shift toward the commercial district, mall, and interstate
    area. You can see that the distribution for Zone 1W contracts and shifts southeast
    toward the commercial district located along Roosevelt Highway that runs through
    the middle of the City. The same is true for Zone 3 that contracts along Shannon
    Parkway, another major commercial thoroughfare. Zone 2 actually expands toward
    both Shannon Parkway and Roosevelt Highway during the last half of the year. 
    The concentration for Zone 1E stays about the same size but certainly shifts south
    toward the intersection of US Highway 29, Scarborough Road, and Stonewall Tell
    Road. This is another major artery with a lot of commercial development.

    to be correct. You can now provide him with the data he needs to take to the City
    Council, so they can make an informed decision about the distribution of police
    resources.
