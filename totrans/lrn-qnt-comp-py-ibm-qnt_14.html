    <h1 id="_idParaDest-226" class="chapterTitle">Appendix A: Resources</h1>
    <p class="normal">In addition to this book, there are many other resources available that I highly recommend you use to get a deeper understanding of quantum computing and where to find the latest research. As you will notice, quantum technology is evolving at a very rapid pace, so much that it was rather difficult to keep up as this book was written. Believe it or not, it took longer to update and keep up with the updates for this edition than it took to write the first edition! But believe me, it was well worth the wait, as the current state of quantum has not only changed how we program but how we build and run circuits. Things which were challenging in the past such as creating circuits at the gate level are now much easier using primitives and other features of the Qiskit Runtime.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following resources should help guide you to understanding not only the fundamentals and the technology, but will keep you up to date with the latest features and releases. In fact, Qiskit 1.0, which was released during the writing of this book, has so much that it would likely need a book all on its own! The contents of this appendix is far from an exhaustive list of resources, but it does have key links and information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">IBM Quantum Learning Platform</strong>: This is where you can find a variety of learning resources for all levels: <a href="https://learning.quantum.ibm.com"><span class="url">https://learning.quantum.ibm.com</span></a>. Here, you will find various learning materials, tutorials, and online courses, which include topics beyond quantum<a id="_idIndexMarker1517"/> computing, including an introduction to quantum cryptography. All courses are perfect for beginners and experienced researchers and developers; each course walks you step by step from the basics all the way up to advanced topics.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">The documentation</strong>: The link for the full documentation is <a href="https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/"><span class="url">https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/</span></a>. This is the main documentation page for all the topics discussed in this book. This link is one you’ll want to bookmark as it will be your guide and at times a great time-saver to help you migrate code to new versions or to get familiarity with new features.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">The Qiskit GitHub repository</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker1518"/>GitHub repository link for Qiskit is <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit"><span class="url">https://github.com/Qiskit</span></a>. This is the Qiskit GitHub repository where you will find the open-source code for Qiskit. Like most other open-source GitHub projects, you can fork and contribute to the open-source project by either mitigating any issues or implementing a design request. You can also submit requests for enhancements or issues <a id="_idIndexMarker1519"/>you may find. If it is your first time, it is recommended to work on issues labeled <em class="italic">good first issue</em>.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Qiskit Slack community</strong>: The link to join the Qiskit Slack community is <a href="https://qisk.it/join-slack"><span class="url">https://qisk.it/join-slack</span></a>. This is the Qiskit community’s worldwide Slack channel. It is here where the real<a id="_idIndexMarker1520"/> fun begins! You’ll not only find quantum researchers, professors, students, and quantum enthusiasts, but you’ll also find various channels that discuss all aspects of quantum and Qiskit, from hardware to software, to practically any quantum project you can think of. This is where you can meet others like you who are either just getting started or looking to advance their knowledge.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Quantum Algorithm Zoo</strong>: As the welcome page indicates, <em class="italic">this site is a comprehensive catalog of quantum algorithms</em>. It provides details about the algorithm type, speedup, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker1521"/>description of the algorithm. They are grouped by types such as <em class="italic">algebraic and number-theoretic</em>, <em class="italic">oracular</em>, <em class="italic">approximation and simulation</em>, and several others. This is very useful should you want to get a quick overview of an algorithm and how it works. The link for this page is <a href="http://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/"><span class="url">http://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/</span></a>.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Arxiv: Quantum Physics</strong>: This is an open-access documentation repository for scholarly papers and articles, at <a href="https://arxiv.org/archive/quant-ph"><span class="url">https://arxiv.org/archive/quant-ph</span></a>. This resource is for articles<a id="_idIndexMarker1522"/> that specifically cover the topic of quantum physics, a topic that also includes many quantum computation papers.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">IBM Quantum Network quantum papers</strong>: This resource provides a list of all research papers that were published by the<a id="_idIndexMarker1523"/> IBM Quantum research team and <strong class="keyWord">IBM Quantum Network</strong> partners and members: <a href="https://ibm.biz/quantum-network-arxiv"><span class="url">https://ibm.biz/quantum-network-arxiv</span></a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal-one">The link is to an <strong class="keyWord">AirTable</strong>, an online <a id="_idIndexMarker1524"/>hybrid spreadsheet database, which lists the industry domains to which a given project is relevant, such as <em class="italic">finance</em>, <em class="italic">optimization</em>, <em class="italic">chemistry</em>, <em class="italic">machine learning</em>, <em class="italic">error mitigation</em>, <em class="italic">quantum utility</em>, and so on. It also lists the name of the company and which quantum computers they used during their research. Arxiv links to all the papers listed are also included. This is a great resource to have to ensure you keep up to speed on the latest research and the wider quantum research landscape.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">The Qiskit YouTube channel</strong>: The URL for this channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Qiskit"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/Qiskit</span></a>. This is the official Qiskit YouTube channel, on which there <a id="_idIndexMarker1525"/>are several series on research and development with frequently scheduled uploads to keep viewers up to date on the latest content and research from the IBM quantum research team, and IBM Quantum Network partners and members.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">SciRate</strong>: This site (<a href="https://scirate.com/"><span class="url">https://scirate.com/</span></a>) gathers the top-rated Arxiv papers in each category, including quantum<a id="_idIndexMarker1526"/> physics. It’s a good resource should you have time to read what most people are reading about from Arxiv.</li>
