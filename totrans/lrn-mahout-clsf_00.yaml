- en: Thanks to the progress made in the hardware industries, our storage capacity
    has increased, and because of this, there are many organizations who want to store
    all types of events for analytics purposes. This has given birth to a new era
    of machine learning. The field of machine learning is very complex and writing
    these algorithms is not a piece of cake. Apache Mahout provides us with readymade
    algorithms in the area of machine learning and saves us from the complex task
    of algorithm implementation.

- en: 'The intention of this book is to cover classification algorithms available
    in Apache Mahout. Whether you have already worked on classification algorithms
    using some other tool or are completely new to the field, this book will help
    you. So, start reading this book to explore the classification algorithms in one
    of the most popular open source projects which enjoys strong community support:
    Apache Mahout.'
