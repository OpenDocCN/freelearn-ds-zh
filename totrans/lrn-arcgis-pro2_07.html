                    Creating and Working with Projects
                </header>
      <article>
        <p><strong>ArcGIS Pro</strong> has reintroduced the concept of projects to Esri users. Esri first introduced the concept of managing your <strong>Geographic Information System</strong> (<strong>GIS</strong>) using project files with their <strong>ArcView </strong><strong>GIS</strong> application. ArcView GIS used projects to manage map layouts, views, tables, data connections, and more all within a single <kbd>.apr</kbd> file. This allowed us to access everything associated with a project from a single location.</p>
        <p>When Esri released ArcGIS in 1999, the previously described method was dropped. In its place, Esri decided to use separate files called <strong>map documents</strong> (<kbd>.mxd</kbd> files) for <strong>ArcMap</strong>. A map document contains a single map with one or more data frames. So, for each map you need, you will have to create a separate map document. If you also had to create 3D maps, you would need another separate file called a scene (<kbd>.sxd</kbd>). All of this means you often have tens to hundreds of files to manage and keep track of, which makes management much harder.</p>
        <p><strong>ArcGIS Pro projects</strong> greatly simplify GIS management. Now, projects allow you to consolidate all of the resources needed to complete a project in a single place. So, this chapter will help you learn that you no longer need to search for the correct map document. You just need to open the ArcGIS Pro project file for the project that you are interested in and all the maps, data connections, layouts, tools, and more will appear there. This chapter will also help you to locate services much faster. Also, after completing this chapter, you will be able to create your own project and templates.</p>
        <p>In this chapter, you will learn how to work with projects. This will include the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Working with an ArcGIS Pro project</li>
          <li>Creating a new project and project templates</li>
          <li>Creating custom project templates</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="uuid-5cc38f6a-f00c-46c8-8962-aae807d21761">Technical requirements</h1>
        <p>To complete the exercises in this chapter, you will need access to <strong>ArcGIS Pro 2.6</strong> or higher. Any license level for the software will suffice. </p>
        <h1 id="uuid-6afcd830-6155-40d0-847a-f2a1e2d2ab2d">Working with an ArcGIS Pro project</h1>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro utilizes project files in place of map documents and scenes to access GIS data, make maps, perform analysis, and share work. Project files have a <kbd>.aprx</kbd> file extension and include all the GIS resources that are needed for a given project. Projects can be created and shared on your local network so that others in the project team can quickly access the resources that they need to complete their assigned tasks.</p>
        <p>This section will help you learn how to create a new project with Esri templates by working through a hands-on exercise.</p>
        <p>Each project will have components and resources that are associated with each specific project. Some of these components and resources will be common to multiple projects, while others will be unique to individual projects. So, just because a component or resource is linked to one project, does not mean it cannot be used in another project.</p>
        <p>Projects also have their own terminology associated with them. It will be important to understand this terminology when working with projects. We will now begin by exploring the terminology associated with projects and some of the components or resources that can be included in a project.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-50c804ec-9738-43e8-a292-4827f27a76f2">Understanding project terminology</h2>
        <p>Like the ArcGIS Pro application, projects in ArcGIS Pro have a vocabulary associated specifically with them. We will quickly define some of these terms so that you can begin to understand what they mean as you will come across them throughout this book, hear about them at conferences, see them in Esri publications, and so on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project item</strong>: A project item is any item, component, or resource stored within an ArcGIS Pro project. Project items include maps, scenes, folder connections, database connections, ArcGIS Server connections, <strong>Web Map Service</strong> (<strong>WMS</strong>) connections, toolboxes, locators, and more. These items are accessed within ArcGIS Pro from the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane or the catalog view.</li>
          <li><strong>Portal</strong>: A portal in ArcGIS Pro refers to a connection to either <strong>ArcGIS Online</strong> or <strong>Portal for ArcGIS</strong>. ArcGIS Online is Esri's cloud solution for storing and accessing GIS resources, including maps, data, and applications. Portal for ArcGIS provides the same functionality as ArcGIS Online but is installed and hosted on your organization's local infrastructure. Portal for ArcGIS is also part of <strong>ArcGIS Enterprise</strong>, formerly called <strong>ArcGIS Server</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Portal item</strong>: A portal item is any item that is accessed via a designated portal. Portal items might include web maps, feature layers, tile layers, layer packages, map packages, and project packages.</li>
          <li><strong>Project package</strong>: A project package is similar to a layer or map package. It bundles or zips all items associated with a project into one consolidated file. A project package can be used to share projects with others that may not be connected to your network or to archive a project. The project package will have a <kbd>.ppkx</kbd> file extension and can be stored in a local folder or uploaded to your portal.</li>
          <li><strong>The <kbd>Home</kbd> folder</strong>: The <kbd>Home</kbd> folder refers to the folder where the project file is stored. The <kbd>Home</kbd> folder is where ArcGIS Pro creates project-specific content unless the user specifies a different location. The <kbd>Home</kbd> folder can only be changed by saving a project to a different folder. The default home folder for new projects is <kbd>C:\Users\%user name%\Documents\ArcGIS\Projects</kbd>.</li>
          <li><strong>Default geodatabase</strong>: The default geodatabase is used by the geoprocessing tools as the automatic default workspace for the resulting output items of the tools. This means new feature classes resulting from the use of analysis, conversion, and other tools will automatically be saved to the default geodatabase unless you specify a different location. Any geodatabase can be used as the default geodatabase. When a new project is created, ArcGIS Pro will automatically create a new geodatabase file for the project in the <kbd>Home</kbd> folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that you understand some of the terms associated with a project, it is time to look at how to manage one. As you will see, a single ArcGIS Pro project can contain a large number of items. In the next section, you will learn how to use the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane to manage and access these items.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-5de95558-3159-4b26-abad-f65cfade5f1c">Using the Catalog pane</h3>
        <p>When you open a project or create a new project in ArcGIS Pro, the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane will be one of the first things you see. By default, it will be located on the right-hand side of the ArcGIS Pro interface, opposite the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane.</p>
        <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane consists of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> tab</li>
          <li>The <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab</li>
          <li>The <span class="packt_screen">Favorites</span> tab</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will look at these elements in the following sections.</p>
        <h4 id="uuid-56eb5e27-f78c-4011-9327-4e27a2e88a14">The Project tab</h4>
        <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane provides access to the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span>items. From there, you can access maps, scenes, folder connections, layouts, database connections, and other elements that are associated with the project, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/d5649fec-e580-4a64-9bf1-cf3c31ecfabd.png" style="width:56.83em;"/>
        </p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">The <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, shown in the previous screenshot, contains three tabs at the topâ€”<span class="packt_screen">Project</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Favorites</span>. The <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> tab allows you to access project items that are eitherstored within the project, such as maps or layouts, or that you have established a connection to for the project, such as a folder, database, or web connection. It should be mentioned that ArcGIS Pro does not support personal geodatabases. However, files, workgroups, and enterprise geodatabases are supported.</p>
        <p>We will now move on to the <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab section.</p>
        <h4 id="uuid-3bb611ec-9a4b-4a9b-96d8-86c8b943c111">The Portal tab</h4>
        <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab provides access to connections that you have established to either ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. From this tab, you will be able to access content that has been published and content that you have permission to use. This can include web maps, feature layers, and web apps. The <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab has four buttons located on it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="packt_screen">My Content</span>: The first button is <span class="packt_screen">My Content</span>. This allows you to access content that was created by you in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. This might include web maps, web scenes, the dashboard, layer packages, and more:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/3eca2bb5-6d45-4c5f-a25f-ceef136751d0.png" style="width:37.00em;"/>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="packt_screen">Gr</span><span class="packt_screen">oups</span>: The second button is <span class="packt_screen">Groups</span>. This button allows you to see the various groups that you are a member of and the content shared to these groups:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/402b0ae0-efe2-4693-821b-5580f6a78f2a.png" style="width:33.00em;"/>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="packt_screen">All Portal</span>: The next button is <span class="packt_screen">All Portal</span>. This allows you to see content shared with you in all the portals that you have connected other than your primary portal. If you are connected to ArcGIS Online, this includes any data that has been published in ArcGIS Online and shared with everyone. Because of the amount of data that can be available, when you click on this button, the content area will appear blank. So, you must search for content for it to appear. The following screenshot shows the <span class="packt_screen">All Portal</span> tab:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/39be88e5-2c1e-47ca-b6da-3475df75d733.png" style="width:27.67em;"/>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="NormalPACKT"><span class="packt_screen">Living Atlas</span>: The last button is <span class="packt_screen">Living Atlas</span>. Esri's <span class="packt_screen">Living Atlas</span> feature provides data that you can access that can only be posted from authoritative sources:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/0b4405e2-3fb3-4462-979a-100fabd92276.png" style="width:28.00em;"/>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">General ArcGIS Online content can be published by anyone with an account, but only vetted contributors are allowed to publish data to <span class="packt_screen">Living Atlas</span>. This makes it a great starting point if you are looking for data that you can have some level of trust in.</p>
        <p>We will now move on to the <span class="packt_screen">Favorites</span> tab section.</p>
        <h4 id="uuid-023c006c-cff0-4d44-91f6-3e5de918701c">The Favorites tab</h4>
        <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Favorites</span> tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane allows you to store connections to databases, folders, and servers that you use on a regular basis across multiple projects. This provides easy access to these resources from ArcGIS Pro and the ability to quickly add them to your current active project.</p>
        <p>For example, if your organization has a primary GIS database that it uses for all its projects, then you might want to add it as a favorite so that you can easily add it to new projects as you start them. The following screenshot shows some examples of favorite connections:</p>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/89674df1-6d2f-41c9-b29a-66939f8bdfbf.png" style="width:33.92em;"/>
        </p>
        <p>As you can see from the preceding screenshot, favorites are stored as part of your user profile, just like your <kbd>Documents</kbd> folder in <strong>Windows</strong>. If your organization uses roaming profiles, then your ArcGIS favorites will follow you from one computer to another within your network.</p>
        <p>If your organization only uses local profiles, which is fairly common, then your favorites will only be available on the computer that you are using when you add the resource to your favorites. As of ArcGIS Pro 2.5 and earlier, there is no way to share favorites with others or through an entire organization. </p>
        <p>Once an item has been added to your favorites, you can also choose to have that item automatically added to any new project that you create. This means that it will automatically appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane and the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> tab for each new project that you create. </p>
        <p>Now that you have learned some of the terms associated with a project and have been introduced to the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, it is time for you to see it in action.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-ed758937-bff8-4159-aac5-b6a34651f1b0">Exercise 5A â€“ Using the Catalog pane</h2>
        <p>In this exercise, you will work to create a map that shows the floodplains and drainage basins for Union City. You will need to use the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane to establish several connections, including a geodatabase and server to access additional information that is needed to create the map. You will start with an existing project that is included with the data that you downloaded, which already contains a basic map.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-916a2747-cea8-447f-a8a4-b7b9274cb671">Step 1 â€“ Opening and saving a project</h3>
        <p>In this step, you will open an existing project and then save it. This will be the project you will continue to work with during this exercise:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro</span>. Again, remember that you will need an internet connection and access to ArcGIS Online.</li>
          <li>Using the skills you have learned in past chapters, open the ArcGIS Pro <kbd>Exercise 5A</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\IntroArcPro\Chapter5</kbd>.</li>
          <li>Then, save the project as <kbd>%your name% Ex5A</kbd> (for example, <kbd>Tripp Ex5A.aprx</kbd>). Save the project in the same location as the one you opened in the previous step.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have successfully opened the correct project and saved it, you should see the following visual:</p>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/3b388389-b7f1-446c-9bca-c36c84d8769a.png" style="width:68.25em;"/>
        </p>
        <p>Now, let's continue with the exercise and move on to the next step, where you will use the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane to explore the project you just opened.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-f37e247d-8ce2-46be-85f9-4070a2c63af1">Step 2 â€“ Navigating the Catalog pane</h3>
        <p>Now that you have opened the project, you should see the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane located on the right-hand side of the ArcGIS Pro interface. In this step, you will see what content is already available in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, click on the small arrowhead located on the left-hand side of <span class="packt_screen">Maps</span> to expand that section.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What do you see listed under <span class="packt_screen">Maps</span>? </em></div>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> section under the same pane.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What do you see listed under the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> section? </em></div>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Expand the ArcGIS Pro <kbd>Exercise 5A</kbd> geodatabase to see which feature classes it contains.</li>
          <li>Compare the layers in the map to the feature classes in the geodatabase for the project.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>Does the map contain all the layers that reference all the feature classes in the geodatabase? Does the project geodatabase contain feature classes that represent the floodplains or drainage basins? </em></div>
        <ol start="5">
          <li>Expand the remaining sections within the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane to see the rest of the project items you currently have access to.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What other items are currently available in this project? </em></div>
        <ol start="6">
          <li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane. By default, you start on the <span class="packt_screen">My Content</span> list.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="7">
          <li>Explore the portal items that are available to you in <span class="packt_screen">My Content</span> list by moving your pointer over some of them.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_infobox">It is possible that you may see nothing if you have never published any content to ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. Later in this book, you will publish a map and project to ArcGIS Online. These items will then show up in your portal and the <span class="packt_screen">My Content</span> list.</div>
        <ol start="8">
          <li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Groups</span> button located on the <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab to see what groups you are a member of or have access to.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What groups do you see?</em></div>
        <p>Again, you may see nothing here if you have not created groups for your organization in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS before. As your organization makes more use of these technologies, expect the list of groups to grow.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-0d28803f-e6f1-43ae-bd0c-186780a2f2d8">Step 3 â€“ Adding a database connection</h3>
        <p>In this step, you will add a connection to another geodatabase that contains additional data you need for this project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click back on the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane.</li>
          <li>Right-click on <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add Database</span>, as in the following screenshot:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/824f298f-2f27-4941-8f0b-9ab5beb34d24.png" style="width:18.92em;"/>
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Select Existing Geodatabase</span> window, navigate to <kbd>C:\Student\IntroArcPro\Databases</kbd>. Select <kbd>UnionCity.gdb</kbd> and click <span class="packt_screen">Open</span>. You should now see the <kbd>UnionCity</kbd> geodatabase in the<span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span>pane located below <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro Exercise 5A project geodatabase</span>. The <kbd>UnionCity</kbd> geodatabase contains additional layers that you will need to add to your map.</li>
          <li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">UnionCity</span> geodatabase so that you can see what feature classes it contains. Select the<span class="packt_screen">Floodplains</span>feature class.</li>
          <li>Holding down your<em>Ctrl</em>key, select the<span class="packt_screen">Watersheds</span>feature class. </li>
          <li>Right-click on one of the two selected feature classes and choose the <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span>option.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your map should look similar to the map shown in the following screenshot: </p>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/ae6ade60-8c8e-4917-9310-b2e90739ed95.png" style="width:71.00em;"/>
        </p>
        <p>You have just added two layers from a different geodatabase to your map after you made the connection to it.</p>
        <div class="packt_tip">Your colors may be different, depending on what colors ArcGIS Pro assigned to the new layers you added. Remember that ArcGIS Pro assigns a random color to new layers added to the map.</div>
        <p>Although the layers are now visible on the map, you will need to make some adjustments to the layers to improve the readability of the map.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-07cb8d6d-3d91-41b5-a642-81abb9c192a3">Step 4 â€“ Adjusting the layers</h3>
        <p>In this step, you will make changes to the symbology and layer orders so that the map is easier to read. First, you will make changes to the layer draw order:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Watersheds</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane located on the left-hand side of the ArcGIS Pro interface.</li>
          <li>While holding your left mouse button down, drag the <span class="packt_screen">Watersheds</span> layer so that it is below the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer in your layer list.</li>
          <li>Now, drag the <span class="packt_screen">Floodplains</span> layer so that it is below the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer but above the <span class="packt_screen">Watersheds</span> layer, as in the following screenshot:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/029a28ff-fd87-4412-a6c6-a2d5aee98d74.png" style="width:46.08em;"/>
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Floodplains</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Zoom to Layer</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you have the layers of the drawing in the order you want them, it is time to work on the symbology for each. You will need to add a new style to your project first that contains the symbol for the floodplains.</p>
        <ol start="5">
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, right-click on <span class="packt_screen">Styles</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Add</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add Style</span>, as in the following screenshot:</li>

        <h1 id="uuid-7246caba-ff09-4984-93ed-2d3600dd466d">Creating a new project and project templates</h1>
        <p>As you have seen, projects are the very core of ArcGIS Pro. They contain all the things that a user needs to complete various GIS tasks. So far, the projects that you have used have already been created for you. They have included maps, three-dimensional scenes, and various connections. <em>So, how do you create a new project from scratch?</em></p>
        <p>In this section, you will learn how to create a new project using one of the Esri-provided templates. Then, you will learn how to create your own template that you can use to create new projects.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-8a5936c9-cec6-4ec0-9b59-cc1275ddcb3d">Creating a new project with Esri templates</h2>
        <p>When you open ArcGIS Pro, you have the option to open an existing project or create a new one. If you choose to create a new one, you first select a template. The template automatically generates content and connections within the new project that is created. The template can create maps, scenes, layouts, folder connections, database connections, and more.</p>
        <p>In addition to what is created by the template, a new project-specific file geodatabase and toolbox are created in the <kbd>Home</kbd> folder. Remember that the <kbd>Home</kbd> folder is the folder that contains the new project that is created by us. Your new project will set these as the default geodatabase and toolbox used by the new project automatically.</p>
        <p>Esri has already created some templates that you can use to begin creating new projects as soon as you install ArcGIS Pro. This includes four templates, each with a specific use in mind. They are as follows:</p>

        <p>In this step, you will connect to the Union City geodatabase that you used in the last exercise. You will then set up your scene to use the <strong>Digital Elevation Model</strong> (<strong>DEM</strong>) in that geodatabase as the elevation surface. The elevation surface serves as the ground level or height that all the other layers are overlaid onto within the three-dimensional views provided in a scene:</p>

        <p>So, in this section, you have learned how to create a new project using Esri's <kbd>Local Scene</kbd> template and how to build out the scene with layers and a local elevation surface. <em>But how do you create your own project templates for use by ArcGIS Pro users in your organization?</em> We will investigate that next. </p>
        <h1 id="uuid-1738528a-8246-4951-95d3-83f99daf37dc">Creating custom project templates</h1>
        <p>In the last exercise, you saw how useful a template can be to start a new project. In this section, you will learn how to create a custom project template.</p>
        <p>Templates can standardize all the projects that you or your organization create in ArcGIS Pro so that they access the correct databases, contain the appropriate styles, and have the proper layout elements. Project templates are really specialized versions of a project package that can be used to create new projects. They have a <kbd>.aptx</kbd> file extension.</p>
        <p>Project templates can be saved to several locations. You can save them to your computer, a network share, ArcGIS Online, or Portal for ArcGIS. Where you save them will help determine who can use them.</p>
        <p>Project templates saved to your computer generally can only be used by you. This can limit their value to an organization. However, since they are stored locally on your computer, they can be better suited for your personal use. This is because they can contain connections to local resources that exist on your computer, which others may not have access to. Also, if you include connections to secure data sources or files, you do not have to worry about whether other users will have permission to also access those locations.</p>
        <p>Project templates you save to a network shareâ€”for example, a folder on your file server or to ArcGIS Onlineâ€”can be used by others in your organization when creating new projects, assuming they have sufficient privileges to access the location. This allows you to standardize projects created by ArcGIS Pro users throughout your organization, which has several advantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Templates can ensure you're using common map layouts, which include standard title blocks, north arrows, logos, and legal disclaimers.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Templates can ensure everyone accesses the correct data sources, folders, styles, and toolboxes.</li>
          <li>Templates can ensure data and files are saved to the proper locations by standardizing a common project structure.</li>
          <li>Templates can ensure everyone uses the correct basemap when creating maps or scenes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The preceding points are just a few of the advantages of using templates within an organization. If you are going to save your templates to ArcGIS Online, there is a security concern that you need to make sure to pay careful attention to, which is who you choose to share with.</p>
        <p>If your organization has enabled sharing outside your organization, it is possible that others who are not in your organization will access your templates. When you create and save a template to ArcGIS Online, you are asked about who you wish to share the template with. If you select everyone, then you will be sharing your template with any users that have access to ArcGIS Online. That includes those who are not part of your organization. This means ArcGIS Pro users who are not affiliated with your company or group will be able to use your template. This also means they will be able to see everything you included in the template, such as database connections, logos, folder connections, layouts, and more. Access to your templates could represent a security breach waiting to happen if you are not careful. So, when you save a template to ArcGIS Online, make sure to pay attention to who you choose to share it with.</p>
        <p>Let's work on another exercise next that helps us create a custom template.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-22da32db-875b-4c66-af9b-b61e368c1a98">Exercise 5C â€“ Creating a custom project template</h2>
        <p>Now that you understand why you would want to create custom project templates, let's look at the how to do so. In this exercise, you will create a custom project template that you will save to your computer. This template will include a map, database connections, and more. Once you create the template, you will then create a new project that uses the template.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-361820d3-b56e-4bfa-9296-122a763c43af">Step 1 â€“ Creating a project</h3>
        <p>All templates start as a project. So, to create a new template, you must first have a project that contains all the standard settings you wish to include in the template. So, we will start this step by creating a new project using the <kbd>Catalog</kbd> template, which provides you with a blank slate upon which you can build your template:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro</span>.</li>
          <li>On the right-hand side in the ArcGIS Pro start page, select the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> project template.</li>
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Create a New Project</span> window, name your project <kbd>%Your Name% Ex5C</kbd> and set your location to <kbd>C:\Student\IntroArcPro\My Projects</kbd>.</li>
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, right-click on <span class="packt_screen">Database</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Add Database</span>.</li>
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Select Existing Geodatabase</span> window, navigate to <kbd>C:\Student\IntroArcPro\Databases</kbd> and then select the <kbd>Trippville_GIS.gdb</kbd> file to add it as a connected database.</li>
          <li>Using the skills you have learned, add the <kbd>ESRI.stylx</kbd> style to the project.</li>
          <li>Save your project.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We will now move on to the next section, which describes the next step.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-479aa556-fa67-42bc-87ec-59d0716b3f68">Step 2 â€“ Setting up a default map in the template</h3>
        <p>Now that you have opened a new project and established some default connections to databases and styles, you will now create a default map that will be included in the template. You will configure a basemap and then set a default view extent:</p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, right-click on <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">New Map</span>. This will add a new map to your project.</li>
          <li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> group tab in the ribbon, click on the small drop-down arrow under <span class="packt_screen">Basemap </span>and select <span class="packt_screen">Imagery</span>.</li>
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, expand the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> folder and the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS</span> geodatabase that are you connected to.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Base</span> feature dataset and right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">City_Limit</span> feature class, then select <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">Your map should zoom to the new <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer you just added, so it should look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/6cdc465f-8b59-4cf9-90b5-5a5fe33141a7.png" style="width:67.25em;"/>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">Remember that the color for the <span class="packt_screen">City_Limit</span> layer may be different in your map because ArcGIS Pro assigns a random color to new layers unless you add the new layer using a layer file.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">Adding the <span class="packt_screen">City</span><span class="packt_screen">_Limit</span> layer also assigns the coordinate system you wish to use for the map and in your template. Just as with ArcMap, the first layer you add to a map in ArcGIS Pro assigns the coordinate system to the map. Now, you will set the view extents, which will be the default for this map in your project.</p>
        <ol start="5">
          <li>Right-click on <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane and select <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span>.</li>
          <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Map Properties</span> window, select <span class="packt_screen">Extent</span> from the left-hand side pane.</li>
          <li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Use a Custom extent</span> tab in the right-hand side panel.</li>
          <li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Current visible extent</span> option located under <span class="packt_screen">Get extent from</span>. This will set your map so that when you select the <span class="packt_screen">Zoom Full extent</span> button, it will take you to this zoom scale. Then, click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> to apply the setting.</li>
          <li>Using the skills that you learned in <a href="5ff05154-4302-4ef5-8ef9-d14ca8d5bb24.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Navigating the Ribbon Interface</em>, make the following changes to the <span class="packt_screen">City_Limit</span> layer:
<ul><li>Set the symbology to a hollow fill.</li><li>Set the outline to <span class="packt_screen">Mars Red</span>.</li><li>Set the outline width to <kbd>2</kbd> pt.</li><li>Rename the layer <kbd>City Limits</kbd><span class="packt_screen">.</span></li></ul></li>
          <li>Save your project.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have created a simple map that will be part of the template you are working to create. This means anyone that uses the template will start with this map in their project.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-7b0082a8-7569-4735-972f-4e136b188ef4">Step 3 â€“ Adding a layout from an existing map document</h3>
        <p>There is one last thing to add to your project before you save it as a template. We want to add the layout that we have been using in the map documents we created with <strong>ArcMap</strong>, which is another Esri application. This will allow our maps to look the same, regardless of whether they are created in ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap:</p>

The <span class="packt_screen">Analyze</span> button will automatically take you to the <span class="packt_screen">Message</span> tab in the pane. You should not see any errors or warnings. If you do, correct them, as recommended by ArcGIS Pro.</li>
          <li>Once you have no errors in the <span class="packt_screen">Messages</span> tab, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> button in the pane. If you are asked whether you want to save your project, click <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span>. </li>

        <p>We will now move on to the last step of the exercise.</p>
        <h3 id="uuid-2f0d3ccb-f083-47f2-b056-4e93716937d5">Step 5 â€“ Creating a new project using a custom template</h3>
        <p>Now that you have created a custom project template, you need to know how to use it when you create a new project. In this step, you will use the project template you just created to create a new ArcGIS Pro project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start ArcGIS Pro.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>In the ArcGIS Pro start page, click on <span class="packt_screen">Select another project template</span>, located on the lower-right-hand side, as shown:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/d020b4a0-0f8a-42d7-83c7-c024a965ceb7.png" style="width:58.33em;"/>
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Select the template you created in the previous step. It should appear in the right panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Create New Project From Template</span> window. Then, click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
          <li>Name your new project <kbd>%your name% template test</kbd>.</li>
          <li>Set the save location to <kbd>C:\Student\IntroArcPro\My Projects</kbd> and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">Your new project should open with a map that looks very familiar. You should see the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer with the <span class="packt_screen">Imagery</span> basemap.</p>
        <ol start="6">
          <li>Take some time to explore the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane. Look at what connections, maps, layouts, and styles are present.</li>
          <li>When you are done exploring your new project, save it and close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have just created a new project using your own custom template.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-eeaaaaf1-b9fc-47a3-a38e-85506bb0aaeb">Word of warning</h2>
        <p>When creating custom templates using ArcGIS Pro, there is something you should know that happens if your template references data or folders that are located on mapped drives. A <strong>mapped drive</strong> is one that is referred to by a drive letter, such as the <kbd>C:</kbd> drive, which is normally the local drive on your computer, or the <kbd>M:</kbd> drive, which is located on a network file server. </p>
        <p>While using ArcGIS Pro, it is preferred that you don't use mapped drives, especially when creating templates. It's preferred that you use a <strong>Universal Naming Convention</strong> (<strong>UNC</strong>) path. <em>So, what is a UNC path?</em> This is what IT people use to connect mapped drive letters to a folder on their server. A UNC path looks something like <kbd>\\GIS_Server\GIS_Data_folder</kbd>. <kbd>GIS_Server</kbd> is the name or IP address for the server on your network. <kbd>GIS_Data_Folder</kbd> is a share created by the server administrator on that server to allow others on the network to access the files contained within it.</p>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro's preference for UNC paths makes sense for data that resides on a server because it is not uncommon for different people in an office to use different drive letters to reference the same location on a server. For example, I might have <kbd>\\GIS_Server\GIS_Data_folder</kbd> mapped to the <kbd>M:</kbd> drive because I think GIS is mapping, so I think it makes sense to map the GIS data to the <kbd>M:</kbd> drive. However, my colleague may map the same server location to the <kbd>G:</kbd> drive for GIS. However, if I used the UNC path instead, it would be the same location for both of us.</p>
        <p><em>So, what happens if you create a template that references mapped drives?</em> Well, when you create a new project based on the template, ArcGIS Pro will actually create copies of your data. It does this without any warning and unless you look closely at your layer sources, you will not notice that this has happened. To learn more about this, visit <a href="https://youtu.be/tyu439Uownk">https://youtu.be/tyu439Uownk</a>.</p>
        <p>It should be mentioned that if you are referencing an Enterprise/SDE database or web services, this duplication will not happen.</p>
        <h1 id="uuid-53da055b-53fa-458d-b859-f8669b2cf69e">Summary</h1>
        <p>In this chapter, you learned how important projects are when using ArcGIS Pro. They are the very core of the application. You have seen how they contain all the items associated with a project, including database connections, maps, styles, toolboxes, layouts, server connections, and more. By having all of these in a project, it is much easier to access the resources that you will need to perform GIS work in ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <p>You now know how to create new projects using the Esri-provided templates, as well as custom ones that you can create. Once you create a project, you also know how to add new resources to the project so that you are able to perform the required GIS functions to complete tasks. As you have seen, a project is not limited to a single database, map, folder, or style. You can choose to make as many connections as you wish so that you are able to access whatever datasets, tools, and symbology that you need.</p>
        <p>Because a single project can contain multiple connections and other items, it is important to manage all the items included in the project to ensure the project runs effectively and provides access to the most relevant data. The <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane in ArcGIS Pro provides the tools and methods to access, add, view, or remove those resources. This will ensure the project performs efficiently. </p>
        <p>Lastly, you learned how a project template can be used to make creating new projects more efficient by preconfiguring various project items. You have the option to use one of the predefined ArcGIS Pro templates, or you can create your own custom templates.</p>
        <p>You now have the skills and understanding for creating maps, scenes, and projects. The next chapter will take you through how to create layouts so that you can present your work in a professional manner.</p>
