- en: In this chapter, we will be taking a tour of three of the standard CUDA libraries
    intended for streamlined numerical and scientific computation. The first that
    we will look at is **cuBLAS**, which is NVIDIA's implementation of the **Basic
    Linear Algebra Subprograms** (**BLAS**) specification for CUDA. (cuBLAS is NVIDIA's
    answer to various optimized, CPU-based implementations of BLAS, such as the free/open
    source OpenBLAS or Intel's proprietary Math Kernel Library.) The next library
    that we will look at is **cuFFT**, which can perform virtually every variation
    of the **fast Fourier transform** (**FFT**) on the GPU. We'll look at how we can
    use cuFFT for filtering in image processing in particular. We will then look at
    **cuSolver**, which can perform more involved linear algebra operations than those
    featured in cuBLAS, such as **singular value decomposition** (**SVD**) or Cholesky
    factorization.

    as our gateway to CUDA—PyCUDA. While PyCUDA is a very powerful and versatile Python
    library, its main purpose is to provide a gateway to program, compile, and launch
    CUDA kernels, rather than provide an interface to the CUDA libraries. To this
    end, fortunately, there is a free Python module available that provides a user-friendly
    wrapper interface to these libraries. This is called Scikit-CUDA.

    Scikit-CUDA, it is conveniently compatible with PyCUDA; Scikit-CUDA, for instance,
    can operate easily with PyCUDA's `gpuarray` class, and this allows you to easily
    pass data between our own CUDA kernel routines and Scikit-CUDA. Additionally,
    most routines will also work with PyCUDA's stream class, which will allow us to
    properly synchronize our own custom CUDA kernels with Scikit-CUDA's wrappers.

    wrappers for the proprietary CULA library, as well as for the open source MAGMA
    library. Both have a lot of overlap with the functionality provided by the official
    NVIDIA libraries. Since these libraries are not installed by default with a standard
    CUDA installation, we will opt to not cover them in this chapter. Interested readers

    Let's spend a moment discussing BLAS. BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines)
    is a specification for a basic linear algebra library that was first standardized
    in the 1970s. BLAS functions are broken down into several categories, which are
    referred to as *levels*.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Level 1 BLAS functions consist of operations purely on vectors—vector-vector
    addition and scaling (also known as *ax+y* operations, or AXPY), dot products,
    and norms. Level 2 BLAS functions consist of general matrix-vector operations
    (GEMV), such as matrix multiplication of a vector, while level 3 BLAS functions
    consist of "general matrix-matrix" (GEMM) operations, such as matrix-matrix multiplication.
    Originally, these libraries were written entirely in FORTRAN in the 1970s, so
    you should take into account that there are some seemingly archaic holdovers in
    usage and naming that may seem cumbersome to new users today.

- en: cuBLAS is NVIDIA's own implementation of the BLAS specification, which is of
    course optimized to make full use of the GPU's parallelism. Scikit-CUDA provides
    wrappers for cuBLAS that are compatible with PyCUDA `gpuarray` objects, as well
    as with PyCUDA streams. This means that we can couple and interface these functions
    with our own custom CUDA-C kernels by way of PyCUDA, as well as synchronize these
    operations over multiple streams.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with a basic level-1 *ax + y* (or AXPY) operation with cuBLAS. Let's
    stop for a moment and review a bit of linear algebra and think about what this
    means. Here, *a* is considered to be a scalar; that is, a real number, such as
    -10, 0, 1.345, or 100\. *x* and *y* are considered to be vectors in some vector
    space, ![](img/47a6873c-3e1b-4b3c-95e8-d1a3a4f796eb.png). This means that *x*
    and *y* are n-tuples of real numbers, so in the case of ![](img/d0e81dc7-0fa8-4bce-a264-941fee2e3ad7.png),
    these could be values such as `[1,2,3]` or `[-0.345, 8.15, -15.867]`. *ax* means
    the scaling of *x* by *a*, so if a is 10 and *x* is the first prior value, then
    *ax* is each individual value of *x* multiplied by *a;* that is, `[10, 20, 30]`.
    Finally, the sum *ax + y* means that we add each individual value in each slot
    of both vectors to produce a new vector, which would be as follows (assuming that
    *y* is the second vector given)—`[9.655, 28.15, 14.133]`.

    right over as the scalar parameter. We then hand the underlying C pointer of the
    `x_gpu` array to this function using the `gpudata` parameter. Then we specify
    the **stride** of the first array as 1: the stride specifies how many steps we
    should take between each input value. (In contrast, if you were using a vector
    from a column in a row-wise matrix, you would set the stride to the width of the

    Another thing to keep in mind is that if the output of a function is a single

    for computing *AB*. Let''s take a single column of *A* and multiply it by *B*:
    this will amount to *k* multiplies and *k - 1* adds for each of the *m* rows in
    *A*, which means that this is *km + (k-1)m* total operations over *m* rows. There
    are *n* columns in *B*, so computing *AB* will total to *kmn + (k-1)mn = 2kmn
    - mn* operations. Now, we use *alpha* to scale *AB*, which will be *m**n* operations,
    since that is the size of the matrix *AB*; similarly, scaling *C* by *beta* is
    another *m**n* operation. Finally, we add these two resulting matrices, which
    is yet another *mn* operation. This means that we will have a total of *2kmn -
    mn + 3mn = 2kmn + 2mn = 2mn(k+1)* floating point operations in a given GEMM operation.'

    large, so we will represent this in terms of GFLOPS – that is, how many billions
    (10⁹) of operations that can be computed per second. We can compute this by multiplying
    the FLOPS value by 10^(-9).

    more advanced linear algebra operations than cuBLAS, such as the Singular Value
    Decomposition, LU/QR/Cholesky factorization, and eigenvalue computations. Since
    cuSolver, like cuBLAS and cuFFT, is another vast library, we will only take the
    time to look at one of the most fundamental operations in data science and machine
    learning—SVD.

- en: SVD takes any *m* x *n* matrix *A*, and then returns three matrices in return—*U*,
    *Σ*, and *V*. Here, *U* is an *m* x *m* unitary matrix, *Σ* is an *m* x *n* diagonal
    matrix, and *V* is an *n* x *n* unitary matrix. By *unitary*, we mean that a matrix's
    columns form an orthonormal basis; by *diagonal*, we mean that all values in the
    matrix are zero, except for possibly the values along its diagonal.

- en: The significance of the SVD is that this decomposes *A* into these matrices
    so that we have *A = UΣV^T* ; moreover, the values along the diagonal of *Σ* will
    all be positive or zero, and are known as the singular values. We will see some
    applications of this soon, but you should keep in mind that the computational
    complexity of SVD is of the order O(*mn²*)—for large matrices, it is definitely
    a good idea to use a GPU, since this algorithm is parallelizable.

    library from Scikit-CUDA; we have to keep many details in mind here, such as when
    to use column-major storage, or if an input array will be overwritten in-place.
    We then look at how to perform one- and two-dimensional FFTs with cuFFT from Scikit-CUDA,
    and how to create a simple convolutional filter. We then showed you how to apply
    this for a simple Gaussian blurring effect on an image. Finally, we looked at
    how to perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) on the GPU with cuSolver,
    which is normally a very computationally onerous operation, but which parallelizes
    fairly well onto the GPU. We ended this chapter by looking at how to use the SVD
    for basic PCA.
