			<p>Learning Tableau has never been easier, thanks to this practical introduction to storytelling with data. <em class="italic">The Tableau Workshop</em> breaks down the analytical process into five steps: data preparation, data exploration, data analysis, interactivity, and distribution of dashboards. Each stage is addressed with a clear walk-through of the key tools and techniques you'll need, as well as engaging real-world examples, meaningful data, and practical exercises to give you valuable hands-on experience.</p>
			<p>As you work through the book, you'll learn Tableau step by step, studying how to clean, shape, and combine data, as well as how to choose the most suitable charts for any given scenario. You'll load data from various sources and formats, perform data engineering to create new data that delivers deeper insights, and create interactive dashboards that engage end users.</p>
			<p>All concepts are introduced with clear, simple explanations and demonstrated through realistic example scenarios. You'll simulate real-world data science projects with use cases such as traffic violations, urban populations, coffee store sales, and air travel delays.</p>
			<p>By the end of this Tableau book, you'll have the skills and knowledge to confidently present analytical results and make data-driven decisions.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Conventions</h2>
			<p>Code words in text form, database and collection names, file and folder names, shell commands, and user input use the following format: "There are also other <strong class="source-inline">File</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Edit</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Flow</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Server</strong> menu options at the top. The purposes of the <strong class="source-inline">File</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Edit</strong> options are self-explanatory. The <strong class="source-inline">Flow</strong> menu can be used to run the flow and the <strong class="source-inline">Server</strong> menu has the option to sign in and publish the flow on Tableau Server." </p>
			<p>Often at the beginning of chapters, key new terms will be introduced. In these cases, the following formatting will be used: "Understanding <strong class="bold">aggregations</strong> is the most fundamental concept you need to keep in mind when working with Tableau." </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Minimum Hardware Requirements</h2>
			<p>For an optimal experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Processor: Dual core or better</li>
				<li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li>
				<li>Storage: 10 GB available space</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Minimum Software Requirements</h2>
			<p>Unlike hardware requirements, software requirements can be challenging to list because Tableau releases new updates to their software every 3-6 months and there are new features added with these new releases. But considering the exercises/activities planned in this book, we expect the following to be required at minimum: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tableau Desktop 2020.1 or above</li>
				<li>Tableau Prep 2020.1 or above</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This book was written and reviewed using Tableau versions 2020.1.x. Though new versions of Tableau are frequently released, the steps used for the exercises and activities in this book are unlikely to change with the version changes. Any known differences at the time of publication will be noted within the text as relevant.</p>
