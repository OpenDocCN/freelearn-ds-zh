<p>As you have begun to see, ArcGIS Pro is a powerful tool for visualizing data. However, you have only begun to scratch the surface. One of the things that makes ArcGIS Pro so powerful is its ability to make use of many different data types and formats.</p>
<p>Unlike other programs, such as Word, Excel, or even AutoCAD, ArcGIS Pro is not limited to a single file type. Based on your experience with previous recipes you have learned that ArcGIS Pro makes use of project with a <kbd>.aprx</kbd> file extension. In the projects, you accessed a<span> </span><span>file</span><span> geodatabase to add new layers to a map and you were able to import a map file with a</span> <kbd>.mapx</kbd> <span>file extension. These are just three of the many different files you can bring into ArcGIS Pro. You will encounter many more the longer you use ArcGIS Pro.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, you will begin to explore some of the various data formats you can use with ArcGIS Pro, and their limitations. You will start with the two basic data categories, Raster and Vector, to ensure you have a good foundational understanding of GIS data. From there, you will learn how to create Esri data storage types, such as a Geodatabase and shapefile. Next, you will see how to access non-Esri CAD formats so they can be added to your maps. Finally, you will explore the use of traditional tabular data in ArcGIS Pro.   </p>

<p>GIS data can generally be categorized as either being Raster or Vector. Within those categories, there are many specific formats. In an ArcGIS Pro project, you will often combine both raster and vector data together in order to create maps, edit data, and perform analyses. So, what is the difference between these two data categories? How do I make use of this data in ArcGIS Pro?</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will explore vector and raster data by adding them to a map. You will perform various steps to help you gain a better understanding of how they work within ArcGIS Pro.</p>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>All rasters consist of cells that are assigned a numeric value. You can think of them as being similar to a spreadsheet. The value assigned to each cell can represent different properties depending on the purpose of the raster. In the case of a color aerial photo, such as the one you have been working with in this recipe, the value assigned to the cell equals the color for each band to be displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><span>: </span>How many bands does Terrain: Hillshade have?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<ol start="24">
<li>Activate the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab.</li>
<li>Click a cell in the <span class="packt_screen">Terrain: Hillshade</span> layer to access the information linked to the cell.</li>
<li>Review the information presented. Compare it to the information you saw when you did the same thing for the Aerial Photo layer.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="27">
<li>Close the information window when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the Terrain layer you added was a good bit different than the Aerial Photo layer even though they are both rasters. The Aerial Photo layer has three bands, where the Terrain has a single band. The Terrain also has more information attached to each cell than the Aerial Photo. That is because the terrain was created to do more than just present a picture. It is designed so you can determine the elevation of an area and perform analysis based on the elevation. You will get a chance to do that later in this book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now, you will look more closely at vector data. The majority of the data you will work with will most likely be stored as a vector, meaning it will be either a point, line, or polygon.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Full Extent</span> button to see the entire map.</li>
<li>Turn off the <span class="packt_screen">Terrain: Hillshade</span> layer by clicking the check box located next to the layer name.</li>

</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Feature Datasets are organizational units in a geodatabase. They act similarly to folders on your computer. They allow you to store related feature classes in a common container within the geodatabase so that you can easily find them. All feature classes stored within a feature dataset share the same coordinate system. This allows the feature classes stored in the feature dataset to take part in a topology and geometric network. Feature datasets only exist in geodatabases. You will not find them in other GIS data formats, such as shapefiles.</p>

<br/>
<strong><br/>
Answer</strong><span>:</span></div>
<ol start="37">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Information</span> window.</li>
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer in the table of contents. Select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span> from the menu that appears:</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span> open at the bottom. This is another way to view attributes associated with a vector layer.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a difference between the fields you saw when using the Explore tool and what you see in Attribute Table?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see the same fields of information in both the Explore tool information window and the attribute table. However, how the information is presented is quite different. The attribute table presents data for all features in the layer in a tabular format. The information window only presents the information about one feature at a time.  </p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>All vector layers will have a database table of attributes attached to it. This attribute table will include a combination of Default fields and User Defined fields. Default fields are those created and maintained by the software. They will vary depending on the type of data and the format. User defined fields are those columns created by software users and must be manually maintained.</p>

<li>Look at the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels attribute table</span> you have opened. It should say <span class="packt_screen">1 of 8,129 selected</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>If it still says <span class="packt_screen">0 of 8,129 selected</span>, you did not select a parcel. This might be due to the Layer not being set as selectable.

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this recipe, you learned how to add raster and vector data to a map. First, you opened an existing project that already contained a map with a single raster layer, this was the aerial color photograph. You then zoomed into that layer using a bookmark to examine it further. Bookmarks allow you to return to specific locations within a map by storing the extents and scale of your map view at the time you create the bookmark. This allows you to easily return to a specific location on the map. There is no limit on the number of bookmarks that are contained within a project. </p>
<p>Once you zoomed into the location using the bookmark, you used the Explore tool to access information linked to a cell within the aerial photo to discover it included three bands. A different numeric value was assigned to the cell for each band, allowing the true color to be displayed in ArcGIS Pro. The information is presented in an HTML window that displays the attributes associated with the cell, feature, or features being identified. This functionality also allowed you to access the information from the parcels layer, which was a vector dataset. From this, you were able to see that vector and raster datasets can have different attributes that can be customized based on their purpose. </p>
<p>In the recipe, you added a raster layer that represented the terrain or elevation. This came from the Esri Living Atlas as a web service which is hosted by Esri's ArcGIS Online. Rasters and vectors can both be published as web services. These are typically accessed through a REST point connection. <strong>REST</strong> stands for <strong>Representational state transfer</strong>. These types of connections provide <span>interoperability</span> across the web along with good performance. </p>
<p>Finally, you added the parcels vector layer to your map and explored it. When you added it to your map, the parcel polygons were displayed in the map view. ArcGIS Pro does this by reading the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for each vertex that makes up the boundary of each parcel. This was demonstrated when you selected a parcel and displayed its vertices using the <span class="packt_screen">Vertices</span> button on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab.   </p>
<p>These coordinates are typically stored in a real-world coordinate system that allows it to be displayed with other layers in the correct location on the Earth. The <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for each vertex are referred to as a coordinate pair. Each pair describes a unique location. In the case of a polygon, no fewer than four coordinate pairs are required to fully describe the location and shape of a polygon. A line only requires a minimum of two, and a point only one. You will learn more about real-world coordinate systems later in this book. </p>
<p>In addition to the spatial component of the parcels layer, you were able to view the associated attribute table. You saw how selecting features in the map also changed what records were selected in the attribute table, demonstrating the one-to-one relationship between features shown in the map and records listed in the attribute table.This showed you that vector data includes two components: spatial/geometry and attributes.</p>
<p>The link between the spatial features and the records in the table is automatically done within the data itself using the <strong>ObjectID</strong> or <strong>FeatureID</strong> (sometimes called <strong>FID</strong>) for each feature.  </p>

<p>As we have mentioned, there are many GIS data storage formats. However, the Geodatabase is the preferred storage format for ArcGIS Pro. It has many advantages over other formats such as shapefiles, coverages, or DWG files.</p>
<p>First, it can store tabular, raster, and vector data in a single database. This makes it easier to manage and access all your GIS data because it is in one place.</p>
<p>Second, it allows for data validation using topologies, geometric networks, domains, and subtypes. This allows you to find and correct errors in your data.</p>
<p>Third, geodatabases are scalable, so they can grow as your organization does. There are several types of geodatabases. Each is designed to support varying sizes of organizations.  So, as you grow, so can your geodatabase.</p>
<p>In the previous recipes, you made use of existing geodatabases. You used the data contained in them to create various maps. In this recipe, you will learn the basics skills needed to create a new geodatabase.   </p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You just created your first geodatabase using ArcGIS Pro. It was a file geodatabase. If you remember from the previous chapter, a file geodatabase is one of three basic types of geodatabases that exist.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>The file geodatabase is designed to be used by small organizations with only one or two primary users. It stores information within multiple files that are contained in a single folder with a <kbd>.gdb</kbd> extension. By default, a file geodatabase can store up to 1 TB per feature dataset, contained within the geodatabase plus at the root of the database. A feature dataset is similar to a folder on you computer used to store related files. A feature dataset is used to group related feature classes within the geodatabase. The total amount of data that can be stored per feature dataset can be changed to 4 or 256 TB using a configuration keyword. To learn more about configuration keywords for a geodatabase file, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/configuration-keywords-for-file-geodatabases.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/configuration-keywords-for-file-geodatabases.htm</a>.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you have created a new database, you need to create items that will actually hold your data. This will include feature classes and feature data sets. We will start with a simple feature class.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">MyGeodatabase.gdb</span> you just created. You can do this from the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> view or pane.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>If you are trying to create the new feature class from the Catalog pane, you may need to expand the Databases folder so you can see the new file geodatabase you just created.</p>
</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Go to the <span class="packt_screen">New</span> option in the menu and select <span class="packt_screen">Feature Class</span> from that:</li>

<ol start="10">
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane should appear on the right side, with the feature class location already filled in. Name the new feature class <kbd>Side_Walks</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Feature class names in a geodatabase have some limitations you should be aware of. They must start with a letter. Though the name can contain a number, it cannot start with one. Also, the name cannot contain spaces or special characters. The only exception is an underscore. The length of the name is limited by the operating system of the computer where you are storing the geodatabase file.  However, I generally recommend keeping them as short as possible to avoid potential issues if you ever need to convert the database to another format.</p>

<ol start="11">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Geometry</span> type by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Polyline</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>

</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see the new feature class you just created. This is only the first part of creating a new feature class. The second part is defining the attributes you want to keep and associating it with the features you will store in the new feature class. So now you will create some attribute fields. </p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Side_Walks</span> feature class you just created. Go to <span class="packt_screen">Design</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Fields</span>, as shown here:</li>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What default fields were automatically created when you created the new feature class?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<ol start="18">
<li>Click where it says <span class="packt_screen">Click here to add a new field.</span></li>

</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">Database fields also have several limitations. The first is the name, it has the same limitations as the name of a feature class. Also, you must designate a data type. Field types typically include: Text or String, Long Integer, Short Integer, Single or Float, Double, Date, Blob, Guid, and Raster. To learn more about these different field types, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/arcgis-field-data-types.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/arcgis-field-data-types.htm</a>.</div>

<p>In this recipe, you learned how to create a new file geodatabase. You then created a new feature class within the geodatabase you created. Once you created the new feature class, you added several attribute fields to the attribute table associated with the feature class you created.</p>
<p>You then learned how to create a new feature dataset in your geodatabase. As you may recall from the previous recipe, feature datasets are an organizational unit in a geodatabase. They allow you to group related feature classes together so they are easier to find and so they can take part in a topology. Remember, all feature classes stored in the same feature dataset will have the same coordinate system. You will learn more about coordinate systems later in this book.</p>
<p>Once you created the new feature dataset, you added new feature classes within it using the skills you learned earlier in the recipe, this included creating several attribute fields.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While geodatabases are the primary format for ArcGIS Pro, Shapefiles are probably the most common GIS data format you will encounter. It has become the default data sharing format because so many GIS applications are able to make use of them. This includes QGIS, AutoCAD Map 3D, MapInfo, Map Window, and Manifold. In addition, most high-grade GPS/GNSS units are also able to input or export shapefiles. This makes them very versatile when you need to share data between different platforms.</p>
<p>They do, however, have some limits. First, shapefiles can only store a single feature class. This means a shapefile will only contain either points, lines, or polygons. It is not able to contain a mix of feature types. Second, shapefiles are built on old technology. They were developed in the 1990s for use with Esri’s now-discontinued ArcView GIS application. A shapefile uses dBase tables to store its attributes. This greatly limits the amount of data that can be stored, as well as the number of fields and field names. Lastly, shapefiles do not have the native ability to validate the data they contain, unlike the geodatabase.</p>
<p>But due to their popularity and versatility, you may often need to create new shapefiles. In this recipe, you will learn how to create a new shapefile.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you created a new shapefile that will be used to store information about street signs. You used the Create Feature Class geoprocessing tool to generate the new shapefile. After you created the new shapefile, you added attribute fields to the table that will store additional information about the street signs.</p>

<p>A lot of data that ends up in GIS is often created first by engineers, surveyors, and landscape architects.  They will often use a computer-aided drafting or design software, commonly referred to as CAD. There are two major CAD applications, AutoCAD and Microstation, with several smaller competitors. These will generally produce files that are referred to as drawings.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro does allow you to add these drawings to your map. Once added, you can adjust display properties, perform queries, and even import the CAD data into your GIS data.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to add a CAD file to a map. Once added, you will learn how to adjust some display properties. Later in <a href="c610a092-e03b-4e0c-a492-c300a817f8b8.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Converting Data</em>, you will learn how to import CAD data into GIS.  </p>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>CAD files will have one of three file extensions: DWG, DXF, or DGN. Like shapefiles and geodatabase feature classes, they too are vector data.</p>
<p>DWG is the native format for Autodesk’s AutoCAD-based product line. This includes AutoCAD, Map 3D, and Civil 3D. DWG files can also be created using other competitor applications, such as IntelliCAD or TurboCAD.</p>
<p>DXF files are also an AutoCAD format. They are used to share data with other CAD applications that do not natively use the DWG format.</p>
<p>DGN is the native format for Bentley’s Microstation product line. Microstation is the primary competitor to AutoCAD. In the United States, Microstation is used by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>As far as ArcGIS Pro is concerned, these files all work the same. So the workflow you will examine using a DWG file will also apply to DXF and DGN files.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you added an entire AutoCAD drawing file to your map by dragging and dropping it from the Catalog map into your map view. Once you added the drawing file to your map, you explored some of the layers that were added in the Contents pane by zooming to one of the newly added layers and expanding the contents of the group layers.</p>
<p>You then changed the symbology of one of the newly added drawing file layers by clicking on the symbology beneath the layer and making adjustments to the color and width in the Symbology pane.</p>
<p>Lastly, you used the Explore tool to access attribute information about one of the parcel lines. You saw that even though the drawing file was created in another application, AutoCAD, it still has attributes just like a shapefile or Geodatabase feature class.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to get data from outside sources that is nothing more than a table with some information that includes <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> data. This may come from a surveyor, someone that collected data with their smartphone, or some other source. The data might be a spreadsheet, a text file, CSV file, or even a database table.</p>
<p>If the data includes coordinates for the location, you can turn these into points within a map. This is called an event layer. The coordinates can be in any known coordinate system as long as they are all the same, meaning that all coordinates for all the records in the table must be listed in the same coordinate system.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will plot the locations of crimes from a standalone database table. This table has several records, each of which has a latitude and longitude coordinate. You will use that information to plot the location.   </p>

<p>The layer you created is still linked to the original table. So, if the table changes, so does the layer. This same process works with spreadsheets, CSV files, and text files, as long as they are formatted similarly. The coordinates do not have to be latitude and longitude. They can be in any real-world coordinate system, such as State Plane, UTM, or WGS 84 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere, as long as you know what it is.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you created points in a map showing the location of crimes using a standalone database table. You did this by first adding the table into your map by right-clicking it in the database and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span>.</p>
<p>Once you added the table to the map, you viewed the table to ensure it included the coordinate values for each record. This was as simple as opening the table and looking at the data it contained.</p>
<p>Lastly, you right-clicked the table in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane and selected <span class="packt_screen">Display XY Data</span>. This opened the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane with the <span class="packt_screen">Make XY Event Layer</span> tool. Because your table used several default fields, it automatically populated the required variables. Once this tool ran, a new point layer appeared in the map showing the actual location of the crimes from the table.</p>

<p>In the previous recipe, you saw how data can be in something other than a traditional GIS format. It can be a standalone table which contains X and Y coordinates along with other information. That can then be turned into points on a map. X and Y coordinates are not the only way we identify a location.</p>
<p>Another even more common way to show a location is with an address. This is how postal carriers knew where the mail needed to be delivered well before the days of GPS. ArcGIS Pro can also use an address to identify a location. This is called geocoding.    </p>
<p>Simply put, geocoding is the process of converting an address or series of addresses into a location on a map or in a GIS. In this recipe, you will learn how to geocode addresses within ArcGIS Pro. This will include determining reference data in your GIS, creating an address locator, and finally geocoding an inspections spreadsheet.  </p>

<li>Before you start ArcGIS Pro, you will need to examine the spreadsheet of inspections you will be geocoding. Open Windows File Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>You should see an icon that resembles a file folder in a folder on your task bar at the bottom of your display. This will open File Explorer.</p>
</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>In <span class="packt_screen">File Explorer</span>, expand <span class="packt_screen">Desktop</span> and <span class="packt_screen">This PC</span> or <span class="packt_screen">My Computer</span>, depending on the version of Windows you are using, located in the area on the left side of <span class="packt_screen">File Explorer</span>.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">C:\</span> Drive so you can see its contents in the area on the right. It may be labeled as <span class="packt_screen">OS</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Local Drive</span>:</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">This spreadsheet represents an export from a permitting and inspections system that is outside of your GIS. That system does not have the ability to display data on a map, but the City Manager wants to see where inspections have been completed within the city. As you can see, the spreadsheet does include the address where the inspection took place. You will use that to geocode the location of each inspection on to a map.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have just added the spreadsheet you examined to your map so that you can geocode it. Before you geocode the data in the spreadsheet, you will first need to create a locator. Geocoding in ArcGIS Pro requires three components if you are using all your own data. You will need the table you want to geocode, reference data in your GIS that has address information, and a Locator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Reference data is typically road centerlines, address points, or parcel polygons. Address points typically provide the greatest level of accuracy. This is followed by parcel polygons. The least accurate is road centerlines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <strong>Locator</strong> is the translator between your source data and the data you are trying to geocode. It provides basic settings and options required to geocode. There are several styles of locators that are dependent on your reference data and how the address information is formatted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">So, before you can create your locator, you must first identify your source data. This will be a GIS layer that already contains address information.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Since there is no address point layer in the Trippville geodatabase, you know that will not be your reference data. You do have parcel polygons, so right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane and select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span>.</li>
<li>Examine the attribute table for the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer to determine whether it has address data.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does the Parcels layer contain address information?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Parcels layer does include some address information. It has a street name, street number, and street suffix. However, not all parcels have complete information. Also, it is missing other information that is included in an address, such as zip code, city, and state. Since the information attached to the parcels is incomplete, it is not well-suited to be your reference layer. It's time to look at the street centerlines to see whether they have more complete address information.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels attribute table</span>.</li>
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Street Centerline</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span>.</li>
<li>Review the <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span> for the <span class="packt_screen">Street Centerline</span> layer. You may need to scroll over to see all the data fields.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the Street Centerline address data more complete than the Parcels layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Street Centerline layer does have more complete address information. It has address ranges for both the left and right sides of the road. It also has fields for the road name and type. In addition, it has fields for the zip code and city on the left and right sides of each road. This is enough information to create complete addresses. So the Street Centerlines layer is the best choice as your reference layer, even if it might not produce the most accurate data points. Now you are ready to create your locator.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span> for the <span class="packt_screen">Street Centerlines</span> layer.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>

</ol>
<div class="InformationBoxPACKT packt_infobox">The style you select is dependent on the geometry of the reference data and how the address information is formatted in the table. For example, the US Address Dual Range style only works with reference data that is a line or polyline feature class, and requires fields that identify starting and ending addresses for the right and left sides of the road. Other styles have other requirements.

<p>In this recipe, you geocoded a spreadsheet of inspections that had been exported from a Permitting and Inspections system which was external to your GIS. To do this, you first had to determine a reference layer. The reference layer is a GIS layer that contains address data. You examined your parcels and street centerline layers to determine which one would be the best reference layer. You determined that the street centerlines layer was best due to the completeness of the address information.</p>
<p>You then created a new locator that allowed you to use the centerlines as your reference. You used the <span class="packt_screen">Create Address Locator</span> geoprocessing tool found in the <span class="packt_screen">Geocoding</span> toolbox.</p>
<p>Once the locator was created, you were able to geocode the inspections spreadsheet. This created a new point layer in your map showing the locations of the inspections. One of the inspections did not match when you ran the initial geocoding. This was due to a misspelled name. You corrected this in the <span class="packt_screen">Rematch Addresses</span> window, matching it to the correct location.</p>
