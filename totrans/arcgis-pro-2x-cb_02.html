                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As you have begun to see, ArcGIS Pro is a powerful tool for visualizing data. However, you have only begun to scratch the surface. One of the things that makes ArcGIS Pro so powerful is its ability to make use of many different data types and formats.</p>
<p>Unlike other programs, such as Word, Excel, or even AutoCAD, ArcGIS Pro is not limited to a single file type. Based on your experience with previous recipes you have learned that ArcGIS Pro makes use of project with a <kbd>.aprx</kbd> file extension. In the projects, you accessed a file geodatabase to add new layers to a map and you were able to import a map file with a <kbd>.mapx</kbd> file extension. These are just three of the many different files you can bring into ArcGIS Pro. You will encounter many more the longer you use ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will begin to explore some of the various data formats you can use with ArcGIS Pro, and their limitations. You will start with the two basic data categories, Raster and Vector, to ensure you have a good foundational understanding of GIS data. From there, you will learn how to create Esri data storage types, such as a Geodatabase and shapefile. Next, you will see how to access non-Esri CAD formats so they can be added to your maps. Finally, you will explore the use of traditional tabular data in ArcGIS Pro.   </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding Raster and Vector data to a map </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>GIS data can generally be categorized as either being Raster or Vector. Within those categories, there are many specific formats. In an ArcGIS Pro project, you will often combine both raster and vector data together in order to create maps, edit data, and perform analyses. So, what is the difference between these two data categories? How do I make use of this data in ArcGIS Pro?</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will explore vector and raster data by adding them to a map. You will perform various steps to help you gain a better understanding of how they work within ArcGIS Pro.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For this recipe, you will need to ensure that you have installed both the book sample data and ArcGIS Pro software. An ArcGIS Pro Basic license level will be sufficient for this recipe. It is recommended that you complete Chapter 1 or have previous experience using ArcGIS Pro before beginning this recipe. </p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Navigate to <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter2\RasterVector</kbd> by clicking on <kbd>C:\</kbd> in the area on the left of the Open Project window. Then double-click the Student, ArcGISProCookbook, Chapter2, and RasterVector folders.</li>
<li>Select the RasterVector.aprx project file and click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The project will open with a single aerial photograph. An aerial photograph is one example of raster data and is one of the most common you will use.  </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Select the Map tab in the ribbon and then click the small arrowhead located under Bookmarks.</li>
<li>Select the Raster 1 bookmark to zoom into to a specific location in the map.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your map should now zoom in very closely to the aerial you were just viewing:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-784 image-border" height="447" src="img/67cc418e-c40c-488a-9092-e6dfc49b2fd0.png" width="634"/></div>
<p>Pixelated Image due to zoom scale</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The aerial now looks like a series of individual squares. These are called cells, though many people mistakenly refer to them as pixels.</p>
<div><p>All rasters consist of cells that are assigned a numeric value. You can think of them as being similar to a spreadsheet. The value assigned to each cell can represent different properties depending on the purpose of the raster. In the case of a color aerial photo, such as the one you have been working with in this recipe, the value assigned to the cell equals the color for each band to be displayed.</p>
</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Activate the Explore tool on the Map tab in the Navigate group.</li>
<li>Click one of the cells in the Aerial Photo to see what information is linked to the cell you selected:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-785 image-border" height="494" src="img/7c3c1a8d-d96f-493c-88e8-ad77ac8d4b52.png" width="564"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the cells store information. In this case, it stores the values used to display the Red, Green, and Blue bands stored in the photo. When these three bands are overlapped, you are able to see the true color.</p>
<div><p>Rasters can have a single band or multiple bands. Bands are similar to layers. Most aerial photographs have three bands: Red, Green, and Blue. However, some will also have infrared bands if they are multispectral. Those additional bands allow you to extract information such as vegetation and impervious surfaces.   </p>
</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>Close the information window by clicking the small X in the upper-right corner.</li>
<li>Right-click the Aerial Photo layer in the Contents pane and select Properties.</li>
<li>Click Source in the right-hand side of the Layer Properties window.</li>
<li>If needed, expand the Data Source option by clicking the small arrowhead.</li>
<li>Look at the Dataset cell in the presented table.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the dataset listed in the table for the Aerial Photo layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<ol start="15">
<li>Click OK when done.</li>
</ol>
<p>The source for the Aerial Photo layer was 152380.sid. This is what is commonly called a <strong>Mr. SID</strong> file. Rasters come in many formats, Mr. SID is just one. Other common raster formats include: <strong>Joint Photographic Experts Group</strong> (<strong>JPEG</strong>/<strong>JPG</strong>), <strong>Portable Network Graphic</strong> (<strong>PNG</strong>), <strong>Tag Image File Format</strong> (<strong>TIFF</strong>), and <strong>ERDAS Imagine</strong> (<strong>IMG</strong>).</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Right-click the Aerial Photo layer in the Contents pane and select Zoom to Layer.</li>
<li>In the Catalog pane located on the right side of the ArcGIS Pro interface, click the Portal tab located at the top of the pane next to Project.</li>
<li>Click the Living Atlas button, as shown here:</li>

<ol start="19">
<li>In the Search cell, type <kbd>DEM</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Digital Elevation Model</strong> (<strong>DEM</strong>) is a raster format commonly used to represent changes of elevation along the ground.</p>
</div>
<ol start="20">
<li>Right-click Terrain: Hillshade and select Add to Current Map:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-787 image-border" height="308" src="img/3cca68d9-66ca-44c1-8a2e-e3431253e85d.png" width="267"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have just added a raster layer that comes from a web service hosted in Esri's ArcGIS Online living atlas. Data in the Living Atlas is available to everyone for use in ArcGIS Pro and other GIS applications.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Click the Full Extent button located in the Map tab in the Navigate group. It looks like a small globe. This takes you to the full extent of the map. You will see more of the new Terrain layer you just added.</li>
<li>Now you will take a closer look. In the Map tab, click the arrowhead located under Bookmarks and select DEM Zoomed:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-788 image-border" height="310" src="img/68d1e086-87b6-4223-b791-00be5fee6298.png" width="443"/></div>

<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: How many bands does the Aerial Photo have?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How many bands does Terrain: Hillshade have?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<ol start="24">
<li>Activate the Explore tool in the Map tab.</li>
<li>Click a cell in the Terrain: Hillshade layer to access the information linked to the cell.</li>
<li>Review the information presented. Compare it to the information you saw when you did the same thing for the Aerial Photo layer.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="27">
<li>Close the information window when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the Terrain layer you added was a good bit different than the Aerial Photo layer even though they are both rasters. The Aerial Photo layer has three bands, where the Terrain has a single band. The Terrain also has more information attached to each cell than the Aerial Photo. That is because the terrain was created to do more than just present a picture. It is designed so you can determine the elevation of an area and perform analysis based on the elevation. You will get a chance to do that later in this book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now, you will look more closely at vector data. The majority of the data you will work with will most likely be stored as a vector, meaning it will be either a point, line, or polygon.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Click the Full Extent button to see the entire map.</li>
<li>Turn off the Terrain: Hillshade layer by clicking the check box located next to the layer name.</li>
<li>In the Catalog pane, select the Project tab at the top of the pane.</li>
<li>Expand the Databases folder so you see the two geodatabases connected to the project.</li>
<li>Expand Trippville_GIS.gdb so you can see its contents.</li>
<li>Expand the Base Feature Dataset in the Trippville_GIS geodatabase.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>Feature Datasets are organizational units in a geodatabase. They act similarly to folders on your computer. They allow you to store related feature classes in a common container within the geodatabase so that you can easily find them. All feature classes stored within a feature dataset share the same coordinate system. This allows the feature classes stored in the feature dataset to take part in a topology and geometric network. Feature datasets only exist in geodatabases. You will not find them in other GIS data formats, such as shapefiles.</p>
</div>
<ol start="34">
<li>Select the Parcels feature class and then drag and drop it into the map view.</li>
<li>Click the arrowhead under Bookmarks on the Map tab and select Parcels.</li>
<li>Activate the Explore tool on the Map tab and click one of the parcels displayed in the map.</li>
</ol>
<div><strong>Question</strong>: What fields of information are linked to the parcels?<br/>
<br/>
<strong><br/>
Answer</strong>:</div>
<ol start="37">
<li>Close the Information window.</li>
<li>Right-click the Parcels layer in the table of contents. Select Attribute Table from the menu that appears:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-789 image-border" height="206" src="img/a697382e-f252-4deb-b362-3bea30c1c532.png" width="203"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see Attribute Table open at the bottom. This is another way to view attributes associated with a vector layer.</p>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a difference between the fields you saw when using the Explore tool and what you see in Attribute Table?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see the same fields of information in both the Explore tool information window and the attribute table. However, how the information is presented is quite different. The attribute table presents data for all features in the layer in a tabular format. The information window only presents the information about one feature at a time.  </p>
<div><p>All vector layers will have a database table of attributes attached to it. This attribute table will include a combination of Default fields and User Defined fields. Default fields are those created and maintained by the software. They will vary depending on the type of data and the format. User defined fields are those columns created by software users and must be manually maintained.</p>
</div>
<ol start="39">
<li>Activate the Select tool in the Map tab.</li>
<li>Double-click one of the Parcels in the map.</li>
<li>Look at the bottom of the Parcels attribute table you have opened. It should say 1 of 8,129 selected.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>If it still says 0 of 8,129 selected, you did not select a parcel. This might be due to the Layer not being set as selectable. Try going to the List by Selection button in the Contents pane and verifying that the Parcels layer is set to be a selectable layer.</p>
</div>
<ol start="42">
<li>Click the Show selected records button located to the left:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-790 image-border" height="162" src="img/3d646ef7-a3c2-4281-b17e-f5ba9f918c4e.png" width="201"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Only a single record should be displayed now because you only have a single parcel selected.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>Click the Select tool again.</li>
<li>Click the upper-left side of the map and draw a rectangle similar to the following image:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-791 image-border" height="427" src="img/6ef47cd9-f8fc-4669-a9e1-b8e183d7b2f9.png" width="591"/></div>
<p>Selection window location</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>Look at the Parcels attribute table now. You should see an additional records appear in the table now that they are selected.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When working with vector data there is a one-to-one relationship between features in the map and records in the attribute table.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>Click the Clear button located on the Map tab in the Selection group to deselect all selected features.</li>
<li>Close the attribute table by clicking the small X located next to the word Parcels in the small tab at the top of the table.  </li>
<li>Now click the Edit tab in the ribbon.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="49">
<li>Activate the Select tool on the Edit tab.</li>
<li>Click one of the small parcels located along the road. The parcel should now be selected.</li>
<li>Click the Vertices button located in the Tools window on the Edit tab in the ribbon.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>If the selection disappears when you click the Vertices button, then the parcels layer is most likely not set to be an editable layer. To verify, click the List by Editing button in the Contents pane.</p>
</div>
<ol start="52">
<li>Notice the change in the display of the parcel. You should now see the vertices that form the parcel polygon.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Vector data is stored using the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> coordinates of the vertices that form the feature. As you have seen, each of those features is then linked to additional attributes that are stored in the attribute table. So, all vector data includes two components, geometry, and attributes. A group of vector data that shares the same geometry (point, line, or polygon) and the same attribute table is called a <strong>feature class</strong>.</p>
<div><p>Like rasters, there are several types of vector files that you may encounter while using ArcGIS Pro. Some of the most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geodatabase feature class</strong>: Stored in one of several types of geodatabases. Displayed as a gray icon in the Catalog pane. Is the preferred storage format for ArcGIS Pro.</li>
<li><strong>Shapefiles</strong>: Esri format that stores a single feature class. Is made up of multiple files including SHP, DBF, SHX, and others. Displayed with a green icon in the Catalog pane.</li>
<li><strong>AutoCAD drawing</strong>: Has a DWG file extension and stores multiple feature classes.</li>
<li><strong>AutoCAD drawing exchange file</strong>: Has a DXF file extension and stores multiple feature classes. Displayed with a blue icon with a compass in the Catalog pane.</li>
<li><strong>Microstation drawing</strong>: Has a DGN file extension and stores multiple feature classes. Displayed with a blue icon with a compass in the Catalog pane.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol start="53">
<li>Zoom to the full extent and save your project.</li>
<li>If you are not continuing to the next recipe, close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, you learned how to add raster and vector data to a map. First, you opened an existing project that already contained a map with a single raster layer, this was the aerial color photograph. You then zoomed into that layer using a bookmark to examine it further. Bookmarks allow you to return to specific locations within a map by storing the extents and scale of your map view at the time you create the bookmark. This allows you to easily return to a specific location on the map. There is no limit on the number of bookmarks that are contained within a project. </p>
<p>Once you zoomed into the location using the bookmark, you used the Explore tool to access information linked to a cell within the aerial photo to discover it included three bands. A different numeric value was assigned to the cell for each band, allowing the true color to be displayed in ArcGIS Pro. The information is presented in an HTML window that displays the attributes associated with the cell, feature, or features being identified. This functionality also allowed you to access the information from the parcels layer, which was a vector dataset. From this, you were able to see that vector and raster datasets can have different attributes that can be customized based on their purpose. </p>
<p>In the recipe, you added a raster layer that represented the terrain or elevation. This came from the Esri Living Atlas as a web service which is hosted by Esri's ArcGIS Online. Rasters and vectors can both be published as web services. These are typically accessed through a REST point connection. <strong>REST</strong> stands for <strong>Representational state transfer</strong>. These types of connections provide interoperability across the web along with good performance. </p>
<p>Finally, you added the parcels vector layer to your map and explored it. When you added it to your map, the parcel polygons were displayed in the map view. ArcGIS Pro does this by reading the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for each vertex that makes up the boundary of each parcel. This was demonstrated when you selected a parcel and displayed its vertices using the Vertices button on the Edit tab.   </p>
<p>These coordinates are typically stored in a real-world coordinate system that allows it to be displayed with other layers in the correct location on the Earth. The <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for each vertex are referred to as a coordinate pair. Each pair describes a unique location. In the case of a polygon, no fewer than four coordinate pairs are required to fully describe the location and shape of a polygon. A line only requires a minimum of two, and a point only one. You will learn more about real-world coordinate systems later in this book. </p>
<p>In addition to the spatial component of the parcels layer, you were able to view the associated attribute table. You saw how selecting features in the map also changed what records were selected in the attribute table, demonstrating the one-to-one relationship between features shown in the map and records listed in the attribute table.This showed you that vector data includes two components: spatial/geometry and attributes.</p>
<p>The link between the spatial features and the records in the table is automatically done within the data itself using the <strong>ObjectID</strong> or <strong>FeatureID</strong> (sometimes called <strong>FID</strong>) for each feature.  </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a new Geodatabase</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As we have mentioned, there are many GIS data storage formats. However, the Geodatabase is the preferred storage format for ArcGIS Pro. It has many advantages over other formats such as shapefiles, coverages, or DWG files.</p>
<p>First, it can store tabular, raster, and vector data in a single database. This makes it easier to manage and access all your GIS data because it is in one place.</p>
<p>Second, it allows for data validation using topologies, geometric networks, domains, and subtypes. This allows you to find and correct errors in your data.</p>
<p>Third, geodatabases are scalable, so they can grow as your organization does. There are several types of geodatabases. Each is designed to support varying sizes of organizations.  So, as you grow, so can your geodatabase.</p>
<p>In the previous recipes, you made use of existing geodatabases. You used the data contained in them to create various maps. In this recipe, you will learn the basics skills needed to create a new geodatabase.   </p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You just created your first geodatabase using ArcGIS Pro. It was a file geodatabase. If you remember from the previous chapter, a file geodatabase is one of three basic types of geodatabases that exist.</p>
<div><p>The file geodatabase is designed to be used by small organizations with only one or two primary users. It stores information within multiple files that are contained in a single folder with a <kbd>.gdb</kbd> extension. By default, a file geodatabase can store up to 1 TB per feature dataset, contained within the geodatabase plus at the root of the database. A feature dataset is similar to a folder on you computer used to store related files. A feature dataset is used to group related feature classes within the geodatabase. The total amount of data that can be stored per feature dataset can be changed to 4 or 256 TB using a configuration keyword. To learn more about configuration keywords for a geodatabase file, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/configuration-keywords-for-file-geodatabases.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/configuration-keywords-for-file-geodatabases.htm</a>.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you have created a new database, you need to create items that will actually hold your data. This will include feature classes and feature data sets. We will start with a simple feature class.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Right-click the MyGeodatabase.gdb you just created. You can do this from the Catalog view or pane.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>If you are trying to create the new feature class from the Catalog pane, you may need to expand the Databases folder so you can see the new file geodatabase you just created.</p>
</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Go to the New option in the menu and select Feature Class from that:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795 image-border" height="271" src="img/485ab1a3-1fa6-4842-9b5c-331cfb553589.png" width="749"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>The Geoprocessing pane should appear on the right side, with the feature class location already filled in. Name the new feature class <kbd>Side_Walks</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>Feature class names in a geodatabase have some limitations you should be aware of. They must start with a letter. Though the name can contain a number, it cannot start with one. Also, the name cannot contain spaces or special characters. The only exception is an underscore. The length of the name is limited by the operating system of the computer where you are storing the geodatabase file.  However, I generally recommend keeping them as short as possible to avoid potential issues if you ever need to convert the database to another format.</p>
</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Set the Geometry type by selecting Polyline from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Accept all the other defaults and verify that your Create Feature Class tool looks like the following image:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-796 image-border" height="361" src="img/1f701cc8-4c96-49c0-8093-0a1b98bc7b88.png" width="268"/></div>
<ol start="13">
<li>Once you have verified that you have the correct settings, click Run.</li>
<li>When the tool finishes, close the Geoprocessing pane.</li>
<li>In the Catalog pane, expand MyGeodatabase.gdb so you can see its contents.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see the new feature class you just created. This is only the first part of creating a new feature class. The second part is defining the attributes you want to keep and associating it with the features you will store in the new feature class. So now you will create some attribute fields. </p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Right-click the Side_Walks feature class you just created. Go to Design and select Fields, as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797 image-border" height="266" src="img/b48bdf54-f45d-43d5-968d-54e6ba48eb87.png" width="265"/></div>
<ol start="17">
<li>The Design view will open in the middle of the interface. Notice that some fields have already been created. These are the default fields for a polyline geodatabase feature class.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What default fields were automatically created when you created the new feature class?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<ol start="18">
<li>Click where it says Click here to add a new field.</li>
<li>In the Field Name cell, type <kbd>Street</kbd>.</li>
<li>Click in the Alias cell and type <kbd>Street Sidewalk Follows</kbd>.</li>
<li>Click in the Data type cell and choose Text from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Click in the Length cell and replace <kbd>255</kbd> with <kbd>50</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Database fields also have several limitations. The first is the name, it has the same limitations as the name of a feature class. Also, you must designate a data type. Field types typically include: Text or String, Long Integer, Short Integer, Single or Float, Double, Date, Blob, Guid, and Raster. To learn more about these different field types, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/arcgis-field-data-types.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/arcgis-field-data-types.htm</a>.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Click the New Field button located in the Changes group in the Fields tab in the ribbon. This is another way to add a new field.</li>
<li>Fill in the following properties:
<ul>
<li>Field Name: <kbd>Install_Date</kbd></li>
<li>Alias: <kbd>Date Sidewalk was installed</kbd></li>
<li>Data Type: <kbd>Date</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using these skills, try adding another field for pavement type. It should be a text field that is limited to 15 characters:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798 image-border" height="159" src="img/dc80d49b-9df4-4635-9b0d-7c22281ba5b8.png" width="368"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your design view should look similar to this. Your field name for the pavement type and alias may be different, but that is acceptable as long as the length is the same.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Click the Save button, located in the ribbon on the Fields tab, to save the new fields you have created to the feature class.</li>
<li>Close the Design view by clicking the small X located on the tab above the view with Fields: Side_Walks.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="28">
<li>Use the skills you learned in previous recipes to add a new map, and then add the new feature class you just created to the map.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The new feature class should appear in the Contents pane. However, nothing is displayed because it is empty. Later in this book, you will learn how to edit the layer to create new features in it. Now you will learn how to add a new feature dataset to your geodatabase.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>In the Catalog pane, right-click MyGeodatabase.gdb. Go to New and select Feature Dataset:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="30">
<li>In the Geoprocessing pane, the Create Feature Dataset tool should appear. The output should already be defined as <kbd>MyGeodatabase</kbd>. Name your new feature dataset <kbd>Property</kbd>.</li>
<li>Accept the default for the Coordinate System. It should be set to <kbd>WGS_84_Web_Mercator_Auxilary_Sphere</kbd>. This is the coordinate system used by most online mapping systems, including Google Earth, ArcGIS Online, and Bing Maps.</li>
<li>Click Run to create the new feature dataset.</li>
<li>Close the Geoprocessing pane when complete.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now see the new feature dataset appear in your <kbd>MyGeodatabase</kbd> database. It is identified in the geodatabase with three squares that overlap one another. This is the common icon for a feature dataset.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It is empty, so you will create a couple new feature classes in it that you will populate with some features later in the book:</p>

<li>Feature Class Type: <kbd>Polyline</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using the same method you did for the Side_Walks feature class, add the following attribute fields:

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Challenge your skill<br/>
Using the skills you have learned, create another new feature class in the same feature dataset, called Parcels. It should be a polygon feature class. Once you create the new feature class, add the fields for Mapped Acres and Square Feet. Both should be float field types.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, you learned how to create a new file geodatabase. You then created a new feature class within the geodatabase you created. Once you created the new feature class, you added several attribute fields to the attribute table associated with the feature class you created.</p>
<p>You then learned how to create a new feature dataset in your geodatabase. As you may recall from the previous recipe, feature datasets are an organizational unit in a geodatabase. They allow you to group related feature classes together so they are easier to find and so they can take part in a topology. Remember, all feature classes stored in the same feature dataset will have the same coordinate system. You will learn more about coordinate systems later in this book.</p>
<p>Once you created the new feature dataset, you added new feature classes within it using the skills you learned earlier in the recipe, this included creating several attribute fields.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a new Shapefile</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>While geodatabases are the primary format for ArcGIS Pro, Shapefiles are probably the most common GIS data format you will encounter. It has become the default data sharing format because so many GIS applications are able to make use of them. This includes QGIS, AutoCAD Map 3D, MapInfo, Map Window, and Manifold. In addition, most high-grade GPS/GNSS units are also able to input or export shapefiles. This makes them very versatile when you need to share data between different platforms.</p>
<p>They do, however, have some limits. First, shapefiles can only store a single feature class. This means a shapefile will only contain either points, lines, or polygons. It is not able to contain a mix of feature types. Second, shapefiles are built on old technology. They were developed in the 1990s for use with Esri’s now-discontinued ArcView GIS application. A shapefile uses dBase tables to store its attributes. This greatly limits the amount of data that can be stored, as well as the number of fields and field names. Lastly, shapefiles do not have the native ability to validate the data they contain, unlike the geodatabase.</p>
<p>But due to their popularity and versatility, you may often need to create new shapefiles. In this recipe, you will learn how to create a new shapefile.</p>

<p>You need to have completed the previous recipes in this chapter before you can begin this one. You will also need to have ArcGIS Pro and the sample data installed. An ArcGIS Pro Basic license should be sufficient for completing this recipe.   </p>

<p>In this recipe, you created a new shapefile that will be used to store information about street signs. You used the Create Feature Class geoprocessing tool to generate the new shapefile. After you created the new shapefile, you added attribute fields to the table that will store additional information about the street signs.</p>

<p>A lot of data that ends up in GIS is often created first by engineers, surveyors, and landscape architects.  They will often use a computer-aided drafting or design software, commonly referred to as CAD. There are two major CAD applications, AutoCAD and Microstation, with several smaller competitors. These will generally produce files that are referred to as drawings.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro does allow you to add these drawings to your map. Once added, you can adjust display properties, perform queries, and even import the CAD data into your GIS data.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to add a CAD file to a map. Once added, you will learn how to adjust some display properties. Later in <a href="c610a092-e03b-4e0c-a492-c300a817f8b8.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Converting Data</em>, you will learn how to import CAD data into GIS.  </p>

<p>You will need to ensure that both ArcGIS Pro and the book sample data are installed. This recipe can be completed with an ArcGIS Pro Basic license.</p>
<p>This recipe is not based on previous recipes. So, you are not required to have completed any previous recipes before starting this one.  </p>

<li>Locate the Subdivision_NAD83.dwg file. It should have a blue icon with a compass on it.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>CAD files will have one of three file extensions: DWG, DXF, or DGN. Like shapefiles and geodatabase feature classes, they too are vector data.</p>
<p>DWG is the native format for Autodesk’s AutoCAD-based product line. This includes AutoCAD, Map 3D, and Civil 3D. DWG files can also be created using other competitor applications, such as IntelliCAD or TurboCAD.</p>
<p>DXF files are also an AutoCAD format. They are used to share data with other CAD applications that do not natively use the DWG format.</p>
<p>DGN is the native format for Bentley’s Microstation product line. Microstation is the primary competitor to AutoCAD. In the United States, Microstation is used by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>As far as ArcGIS Pro is concerned, these files all work the same. So the workflow you will examine using a DWG file will also apply to DXF and DGN files.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you added an entire AutoCAD drawing file to your map by dragging and dropping it from the Catalog map into your map view. Once you added the drawing file to your map, you explored some of the layers that were added in the Contents pane by zooming to one of the newly added layers and expanding the contents of the group layers.</p>
<p>You then changed the symbology of one of the newly added drawing file layers by clicking on the symbology beneath the layer and making adjustments to the color and width in the Symbology pane.</p>
<p>Lastly, you used the Explore tool to access attribute information about one of the parcel lines. You saw that even though the drawing file was created in another application, AutoCAD, it still has attributes just like a shapefile or Geodatabase feature class.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to get data from outside sources that is nothing more than a table with some information that includes <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> data. This may come from a surveyor, someone that collected data with their smartphone, or some other source. The data might be a spreadsheet, a text file, CSV file, or even a database table.</p>
<p>If the data includes coordinates for the location, you can turn these into points within a map. This is called an event layer. The coordinates can be in any known coordinate system as long as they are all the same, meaning that all coordinates for all the records in the table must be listed in the same coordinate system.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will plot the locations of crimes from a standalone database table. This table has several records, each of which has a latitude and longitude coordinate. You will use that information to plot the location.   </p>

</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see six different fields. Most important are the two at the end, Lat and Long. These are the coordinates that identify the location of each crime. You will now use those to create points in your map that show the location.</p>

<p>The layer you created is still linked to the original table. So, if the table changes, so does the layer. This same process works with spreadsheets, CSV files, and text files, as long as they are formatted similarly. The coordinates do not have to be latitude and longitude. They can be in any real-world coordinate system, such as State Plane, UTM, or WGS 84 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere, as long as you know what it is.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you created points in a map showing the location of crimes using a standalone database table. You did this by first adding the table into your map by right-clicking it in the database and selecting Add to Current Map.</p>
<p>Once you added the table to the map, you viewed the table to ensure it included the coordinate values for each record. This was as simple as opening the table and looking at the data it contained.</p>
<p>Lastly, you right-clicked the table in the Contents pane and selected Display XY Data. This opened the Geoprocessing pane with the Make XY Event Layer tool. Because your table used several default fields, it automatically populated the required variables. Once this tool ran, a new point layer appeared in the map showing the actual location of the crimes from the table.</p>

<p>In the previous recipe, you saw how data can be in something other than a traditional GIS format. It can be a standalone table which contains X and Y coordinates along with other information. That can then be turned into points on a map. X and Y coordinates are not the only way we identify a location.</p>
<p>Another even more common way to show a location is with an address. This is how postal carriers knew where the mail needed to be delivered well before the days of GPS. ArcGIS Pro can also use an address to identify a location. This is called geocoding.    </p>
<p>Simply put, geocoding is the process of converting an address or series of addresses into a location on a map or in a GIS. In this recipe, you will learn how to geocode addresses within ArcGIS Pro. This will include determining reference data in your GIS, creating an address locator, and finally geocoding an inspections spreadsheet.  </p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">This spreadsheet represents an export from a permitting and inspections system that is outside of your GIS. That system does not have the ability to display data on a map, but the City Manager wants to see where inspections have been completed within the city. As you can see, the spreadsheet does include the address where the inspection took place. You will use that to geocode the location of each inspection on to a map.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>Geocoding.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter2</kbd>.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have just added the spreadsheet you examined to your map so that you can geocode it. Before you geocode the data in the spreadsheet, you will first need to create a locator. Geocoding in ArcGIS Pro requires three components if you are using all your own data. You will need the table you want to geocode, reference data in your GIS that has address information, and a Locator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Reference data is typically road centerlines, address points, or parcel polygons. Address points typically provide the greatest level of accuracy. This is followed by parcel polygons. The least accurate is road centerlines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <strong>Locator</strong> is the translator between your source data and the data you are trying to geocode. It provides basic settings and options required to geocode. There are several styles of locators that are dependent on your reference data and how the address information is formatted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">So, before you can create your locator, you must first identify your source data. This will be a GIS layer that already contains address information.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Since there is no address point layer in the Trippville geodatabase, you know that will not be your reference data. You do have parcel polygons, so right-click the Parcels layer in the Contents pane and select Attribute Table.</li>
<li>Examine the attribute table for the Parcels layer to determine whether it has address data.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: Does the Parcels layer contain address information?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Parcels layer does include some address information. It has a street name, street number, and street suffix. However, not all parcels have complete information. Also, it is missing other information that is included in an address, such as zip code, city, and state. Since the information attached to the parcels is incomplete, it is not well-suited to be your reference layer. It's time to look at the street centerlines to see whether they have more complete address information.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Close the Parcels attribute table.</li>
<li>Right-click the Street Centerline layer and select Attribute Table.</li>
<li>Review the Attribute Table for the Street Centerline layer. You may need to scroll over to see all the data fields.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the Street Centerline address data more complete than the Parcels layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Street Centerline layer does have more complete address information. It has address ranges for both the left and right sides of the road. It also has fields for the road name and type. In addition, it has fields for the zip code and city on the left and right sides of each road. This is enough information to create complete addresses. So the Street Centerlines layer is the best choice as your reference layer, even if it might not produce the most accurate data points. Now you are ready to create your locator.</p>

<li>Close the Attribute Table for the Street Centerlines layer.</li>
<li>Click the Analysis tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click the Tools button to open the Geoprocessing window.</li>

<ol start="22">
<li>In the Create Address Locator tool, set the Address Locator Style to US Addresses – Dual Ranges by selecting it from the drop-down list.</li>
</ol>
<p>The style you select is dependent on the geometry of the reference data and how the address information is formatted in the table. For example, the US Address Dual Range style only works with reference data that is a line or polyline feature class, and requires fields that identify starting and ending addresses for the right and left sides of the road. Other styles have other requirements.

<p>In this recipe, you geocoded a spreadsheet of inspections that had been exported from a Permitting and Inspections system which was external to your GIS. To do this, you first had to determine a reference layer. The reference layer is a GIS layer that contains address data. You examined your parcels and street centerline layers to determine which one would be the best reference layer. You determined that the street centerlines layer was best due to the completeness of the address information.</p>
<p>You then created a new locator that allowed you to use the centerlines as your reference. You used the Create Address Locator geoprocessing tool found in the Geocoding toolbox.</p>
<p>Once the locator was created, you were able to geocode the inspections spreadsheet. This created a new point layer in your map showing the locations of the inspections. One of the inspections did not match when you ran the initial geocoding. This was due to a misspelled name. You corrected this in the Rematch Addresses window, matching it to the correct location.</p>
