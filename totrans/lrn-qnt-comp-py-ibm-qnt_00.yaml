- en: Ever since IBM released their first commercially available quantum system for
    free on the cloud back in 2016, many researchers, developers, faculty, students,
    and quantum enthusiasts have been running their experiments on real quantum computers.
    Since then, many in both academia and industry have been investing time and personnel
    to investigate the potential that quantum computing has in store. The first step
    in this quantum journey is education, which I assume is why you purchased this
    book. In this book, you will learn the basic principles of quantum computing and
    how to leverage those principles to create quantum algorithms and run them on
    IBM’s powerful quantum computers.

- en: This book provides you with a step-by-step introduction to quantum computing
    using the **IBM Quantum** platform. You will learn how to build quantum programs
    on your own so you can discover early use cases in your industry or domain and
    get equipped with quantum computing skills.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will start working with simple programs that illustrate how these quantum
    computing principles differ from classical computing and slowly work your way
    up to more complex programs and algorithms that leverage advanced quantum computing
    algorithms.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The quantum computing principles we will explore are superposition, entanglement,
    and interference, then you’ll become familiar on how these are used to create
    quantum circuits, which you can then run on IBM Quantum systems.

- en: Then, you’ll learn about the quantum gates and how they operate on qubits and
    discover the **Quantum Information Science Kit** (**QISKIT**, depending on who
    you ask, is pronounced KISS-kit) and its circuit libraries and advanced features
    to help you build quantum algorithms.

    Grover, and Shor’s algorithms, while visualizing how to create a quantum circuit
    and run the algorithm on any of the quantum computers hosted on the IBM Quantum
    platform.

    by learning about the Qiskit Runtime, which has many functionalities to help optimize
    your quantum circuits.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Python developers who are interested in learning about quantum
    computing and expanding their abilities to solve classically intractable problems
    with the help of Qiskit. Some background in computer science and Python is required.
    While a background in physics and linear algebra is suggested, it is not entirely
    required.

    Science Kit** (**Qiskit**) and its advanced features to develop and implement
    various quantum algorithms, and noise models. Qiskit has various features that
    help you build quantum circuits, algorithms, and applications easily and allows
    you to run them on local simulators and real quantum systems.'

    quantum journey by discussing the basic quantum computing principles of superposition,
    entanglement, and interference, which are used by many quantum algorithms. This
    will also help you understand what differentiates quantum computing from classical
    computing.'

    quantum circuits using the quantum gates and operations we’ve learned about so
    far. You will also learn how these gates and operations are converted into microwave
    pulse schedules, which are what is used to manipulate the qubits on the quantum
    system.'

    the instructions from your quantum program to run on a quantum system, which has
    some interesting work happening in the background. Which qubits are the best for
    running your circuit? Which connections should we select between the qubits that
    minimizes the number of gates? All these are taken care of by the preset pass
    manager generator, which we will cover in this chapter.'
