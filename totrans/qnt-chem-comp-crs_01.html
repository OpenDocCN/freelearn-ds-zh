			<p>Predicting the behavior of matter, materials, and substances not yet measured experimentally is an exciting prospect. Modern computational tools enable you to conduct virtual experiments on freely available resources. Understanding modern models of how chemistry works is essential if you want to get results that match the way Nature operates.</p>
			<p>Classical physics works fine for predicting the trajectory of a ball with Newton's law of gravitation or the trajectory of planets around the sun. However, a more accurate description of Nature, especially chemistry, can be found via quantum physics, which encapsulates the postulates of <strong class="bold">quantum mechanics</strong>, the foundation of quantum chemistry, and quantum computing. To gain the next level of understanding of chemistry predictions, quantum chemistry algorithms need to be designed to achieve a high level of accuracy. It is not enough to simply program approximate methods and have a quantum computer run them to achieve higher accuracy than the same method implemented on a classical computer.</p>
			<p>The postulates of quantum physics are not considered laws of nature and cannot be proven either mathematically or experimentally; rather, they are simply guidelines for the behavior of particles and matter. Even though it took a few decades for these postulates to be formulated and a century for them to be understood by the broader scientific community, they remain a powerful tool for predicting the properties of matter and particles and are the foundation of quantum chemistry and computing.</p>
			<p>This chapter is not an exhaustive presentation of the entire history of quantum physics; however, we will mention some of the crucial figures and introduce the topics that we think are the most influential in the 20th century. We discuss the fundamental concepts of particles and the composition of matter, the physical properties of light and its behavior, plus energy and its relation to matter. We extend these concepts to present the quantum numbers related to certain types of chemical applications and properties that can be specifically used for the advancement of quantum computing and predicting states of matter.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>1.1. Understanding the history of quantum chemistry and mechanics</h1>
			<p>Knowing the development of quantum chemistry during the early part of the 20th century is important in order to understand how the postulates of quantum mechanics were discovered. It will <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>also help you grasp the major approximations that have enabled us to achieve scientific milestones. We will mention concepts that will be discussed and described in later chapters of the book, so don't be concerned if you don't understand what the ideas mean or imply. We want to simply start using the terminology of quantum concepts to give some context to the five postulates of quantum mechanics presented in the rest of the book.</p>

			<p>Quantum mechanics has been a disruptive topic of conversation in the scientific community for just over a century. The most notable controversy of quantum mechanics is that it gave rise to the atomic bomb during World War II. Robert J. Oppenheimer (<em class="italic">Figure 1.2</em>), considered the father of the atomic bomb, is also the inventor <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>of one of the most widely used and influential approximation to date: the <strong class="bold">Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation</strong> of 1926 [Intro_BOA_1] [Intro_BOA_2]. This will be described in depth in <a href="B18268_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Beyond Born-Oppenheimer</em>. The BO approximation assumes that the motions of the nuclei are uncoupled from the motions <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>of the <strong class="bold">electrons</strong> and led to the formulation of the majority of the computational techniques and software packages available to date, including <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>the basic design of a <strong class="bold">qubit</strong> used for quantum computing.</p>
			<p>By the time Oppenheimer published his PhD thesis on the BO approximation with Max Born, his academic advisor, many scientists had contributed to <strong class="bold">quantum chemistry</strong>. The term <em class="italic">quantum mechanics</em> appeared for the first time in Born's 1924 paper <em class="italic">Zur Quantenmechanik</em> [Born]. Quantum mechanics was formulated between 1925 and 1926 with other major contributions from the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Max Planck for the Planck constant and the Planck relation (<em class="italic">Section 1.4, Light and energy</em>)</li>
				<li>Louis de Broglie for the de Broglie wavelength (<em class="italic">Section 1.3, Quantum numbers and quantization of matter</em>)</li>
				<li>Werner Heisenberg for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (<em class="italic">Section 1.4, Light and energy</em>)</li>
				<li>Erwin Schrödinger for the Schrödinger equation (<em class="italic">Section 1.4, Light and energy</em>)</li>
				<li>Paul Dirac for the Dirac equation, a relativistic wave equation for fermionic systems, and for the Dirac notation, also known as bra-ket notation (<em class="italic">Section 1.3, Quantum numbers and quantization of matter</em>)</li>
				<li>Wolfgang Pauli for the Pauli exclusion principle (<em class="italic">Section 1.3, Quantum numbers and quantization of matter</em>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These scientists <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>attended the 5th Solvay conference on quantum mechanics (<em class="italic">Figure 1.3</em>) along with other very influential scientists that are not discussed. This<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> image captures the first cohort of quantum scientists that had a great influence on the 20th century.</p>

			<p>The BO approximation <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>was a necessary development primarily because of the <strong class="bold">Pauli exclusion principle</strong> (<strong class="bold">PEP</strong>), which was formulate<a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>d in 1925. Pauli described the PEP for electrons, and it <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>states that it is impossible for two electrons of the same <strong class="bold">atom</strong> to simultaneously have <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>the same <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>values of the <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>following <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>four quantum numbers: <img src="img/Formula_01_001.png" alt="" width="28" height="25"/>, the <strong class="bold">principal quantum number</strong>; <img src="img/Formula_01_002.png" alt="" width="16" height="36"/>, the <strong class="bold">angular momentum quantum number</strong>; <img src="img/Formula_01_003.png" alt="" width="53" height="35"/>, the <strong class="bold">magnetic quantum number</strong>; and <img src="img/Formula_01_004.png" alt="" width="56" height="34"/>, the <strong class="bold">spin quantum number</strong>. His work has been further extended to bosonic particles. The PEP leads to a certain type of computational complexity that initiated the necessity for the BO approximation; see <em class="italic">Section 1.6, Complexity theory insights</em> for more details. We will go into the detail of quantum quantities and describe PEP for different particle types in <em class="italic">Section 1.3, Quantum numbers and quantization of matter</em>.</p>
			<p>The rapid <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>development by the aforementioned group of thought leaders came <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>about with the important groundwork laid out by their predecessors and their discoveries related to the hydrogen atom – the simplest of all elements of the periodic table:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Johan Balmer in 1885 discovered the Balmer emission line series [Balmer_series].</li>
				<li>Johannes Rydberg in 1888 generalized the Balmer equation for all transitions of hydrogen [Chem_spectr].</li>
				<li>Theodore Lyman from 1906 to 1914 discovered the Lyman series of hydrogen atom spectral lines in the ultraviolet [Lyman_series].</li>
				<li>Friedrich Paschen in 1908 discovered the Paschen spectral lines in the infrared band [Chem_spectr].</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The structure of the hydrogen atom will be discussed in <em class="italic">Section 1.4, Light and energy,</em> and outlined computationally in <a href="B18268_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor208"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) Algorithm</em>.</p>
			<p>The work of Johannes Rydberg led to the definition of the fundamental constant used in spectroscopy. Rydberg worked side-by-side with Walter Ritz in 1908 to develop the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle about the relationship between frequencies and the spectral lines of elements [Rydberg-Ritz]. Rydberg states of atoms are used in quantum computation, and this is discussed in <a href="B18268_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Quantum Circuit Model of Computation</em>.</p>
			<p>A year <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>after the development of the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle, Ritz developed a way to solve the <strong class="bold">eigenvalue</strong> problem [Rayleigh–Ritz], which is widely used today in the field of computational <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>chemistry and is known as the <strong class="bold">Rayleigh-Ritz variational theorem</strong>. This <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>method is the inspiration for the <strong class="bold">Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)</strong> discussed in detail in <a href="B18268_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor208"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) Algorithm</em>.</p>
			<p>In conjunction <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>with the testing of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method mechanically <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>by John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, known for the Rayleigh scattering of light, this method is <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>called the Rayleigh-Ritz method even though it was written and formulated by Ritz. In short, it allows for the approximation of the solutions to the eigenvalue problem. His work led to the method of applying the superposition principle to <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>approximate the <strong class="bold">total wave function</strong>; this mathematical expansion is one of the postulates of quantum mechanics described in <a href="B18268_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</em>.</p>
			<p>With a better understanding of the hydrogen atom, in 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to describe the structure of atoms in more detail with fundamental concepts about quantization and quantum theory [Bohr_1] [Bohr_2]. He received the Nobel Prize in 1922 for his Bohr model. In his dissertation, many articles verify, predict, and assess very accurate Rydberg states of small atoms (Z &lt; 7) as well as the rotational-vibrational (rovibrational) states of small molecules. Bohr's atomic model describes the electron energy transitions starting from the second, first, and third atom electron layers, known as Balmer series, Lyman series, and Paschen series, and the corresponding hydrogen emission spectrums discovered previously.</p>
			<p>In the 1930s, Linus Pauling and Edgar Bright Wilson Jr. popularized quantum mechanics as it is currently applied to chemistry [Pauling]. Pauling eventually received a Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954, and later on, he received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his political activism regarding quantum mechanics.</p>
			<p>The development of the postulates of quantum mechanics since these major contributions has remained, in general, the same to date.</p>
			<p>Thanks to the development of classical computers and clever computational methods, many computational <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>chemistry packages <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>have been produced <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>to further our understanding of chemistry. Some <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>notable methods, other <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>than the <strong class="bold">Rayleigh-Ritz variational theorem, a</strong>re the <strong class="bold">Quantum Monte Carlo</strong> (<strong class="bold">QMC</strong>) [QMC], <strong class="bold">Hartree-Fock</strong> (<strong class="bold">HF</strong>) <strong class="bold">method</strong>, <strong class="bold">Coupled-cluster</strong> (<strong class="bold">CC</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Density-functional theory (DFT)</strong>, among others. In this book, we will illustrate some of these methods with Python and open-source quantum chemistry packages such as PySCF, ASE, PyQMC, Psi4, and Qiskit in subsequent chapters.</p>
			<p>In the late 20th century, Richard Feynman stated that quantum concepts could be used for quantum computing [Preskill_40y]. Physicists Jonathan Dowling and Gerard Milburn wrote in 2002 that we have entered a <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>second quantum revolution, actively employing quantum mechanics <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>in quantum information, quantum sensing, quantum communication, and analog quantum simulation [Dowling]. We will summarize the history of quantum computation in <em class="italic">Section 1.5, A brief history of quantum computation</em>. This second quantum revolution is seen as a way to overcome computational complexity using matter and the postulates of quantum mechanics.</p>
			<p>The question becomes: what is the purpose of implementing approximate methods in a quantum computer? Are quantum computers supposed to help us in reaching beyond the aforementioned methods? We intend to address these questions in this book, specifically in <a href="B18268_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Beyond Bor<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>n-Oppenheimer</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>1.2. Particles and matter</h1>
			<p>In general, particles <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>and matter have three unique properties that do not change: mass, charge, and magnetic spin. For some particles, these properties can have a value of zero; otherwise, these <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>properties are real numbers and can be measured experimentally. Mass can only be positive, while charge can be positive or negative.</p>
			<p>In the following subsections, we will review elementary and composite particles, which include both fermions and bosons. Understanding these kinds of particles is fundamental to the understanding of quantum chemistry and the potential use of qu<a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>antum computing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Elementary particles</h2>
			<p>Elementary <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>particles <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>are either fermions or bosons [Part_1]. The term <em class="italic">fermion</em> was <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>coined by Dirac, who was inspired by the physicist Enrico Fermi. Elementary boson particles are part of the Standard Model [Std_model] and do not necessarily take part in quantum chemistry, but rather fundamental physics.</p>
			<p>The electron (<img src="img/Formula_01_005.png" alt="" width="50" height="33"/>) is the <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>primary elementary fermionic particle associated with quantum chemistry. Electrons have a mass of 9.1093837015 x 10-31 kilograms (kg) [e_mass] and an electric charge of negative one (-1). The size of the electron is on the order of approximately 10-15 centimeters (cm). In most computational methods simulations, we change the reference mass so that an electron's mass is equal to 1, making the computation easier. There are also the muon (<img src="img/Formula_01_006.png" alt="" width="53" height="42"/>) and tau (<img src="img/Formula_01_007.png" alt="" width="50" height="32"/>) particles, which have a negative one electric charge (-1) but are much heavier than the electron. The associated antiparticles, the positron (<img src="img/Formula_01_008.png" alt="" width="50" height="41"/>), antimuon (<img src="img/Formula_01_009.png" alt="" width="53" height="51"/>), and antitau (<img src="img/Formula_01_010.png" alt="" width="50" height="44"/>), have the same mass but opposite electric charge (+1) to their counterparts. The standard computational model can <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>only handle the electron. Recent advanced scientific programs are capable of handling electronic substitutions with muons and taus and the antip<a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>articles.</p>
			<p>The current <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>view of how matter is structured is depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 1.4</em>, using a hydrogen atom as the simplest example. We depict quarks in this image, but to learn more about this, <a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>visit CERN [CERN_quark]. Please note that we have included a fuzzy electron cloud around the <strong class="bold">nucleus</strong> and are trying to move away from the old model of an electron following a well-defined trajectory.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Composite particles</h2>
			<p>The composite <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>particles that contribute mostly to quantum <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>chemistry and computing are atomic nuclei, atoms, and molecules, all of which can be either fermions or bosons. Fermion and boson particles obey the PEP, which is discussed in more detail in <em class="italic">Section 1.3, Quantum numbers and quantization of matter</em>.</p>
			<h3>A<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>t<a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>omic nuclei</h3>
			<p>The building <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>blocks of <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>atomic nuclei are <strong class="bold">nucleons</strong>. Nucleons <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>are <strong class="bold">protons</strong> and <strong class="bold">neutrons</strong>. A nucleus <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>contains one or more <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>protons and zero or more neutrons, which are held together by the strong nuclear force. The size of protons and neutrons is in the order of ~10-13 cm, whereas atomic nuclei range from ~10-13 cm to about ~10-12 cm.</p>
			<p>Protons<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> have an electric charge of positive one (+1), which is equal in magnitude to that of an electron and have a mass that is 1,836.15267343 times greater than the electron [proton-electron-mass-ratio].</p>
			<p>Neutrons <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>have an electric charge of zero and a mass that is 1,838.68366173 times greater than the electron [Neutron-ele<a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>ctron-mass-ratio]. The neutron is slightly heavier than the proton.</p>
			<p>The number of protons in the nuclei determines the type of element in the periodic table (<em class="italic">Figure 1.6</em>). The hydrogen <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>atom is the only element that does not contain a neutron in <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>the nucleus. Isotopes of the elements are determined by varying the number of neutrons within the nucleus. The isotopes for hydrogen are deuterium and tritium. Isotopes play an important role in quantum chemistry as the quantum properties can vary. This is an important aspect in computational chemistry as nuclear effects have an impact using the BO approximation (covered in more detail in <a href="B18268_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Beyon<a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>d Born-Oppenheimer</em>).</p>
			<h3>Atoms</h3>
			<p>An atom <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>defines the chemical properties of the bulk matter. Atoms are the combination <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>of atomic nuclei and the electrons that move about outside the nuclei. An atom has no overall electric charge since the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. The size of atoms is of the order of ~10-8 cm. An ion is an atom with a net electric charge, either positive or negative, acquired by losing or gaining one or more electrons. Atomic isotopes can also lose or gain electrons and be considered ions. If an atom has gained an electron, the atom will have a negative charge; conversely, it will become positively charged whenit  loses an electron. The size of ions can vary. A positive ion is called a cation, and a negative ion is called an anion. Atoms, isotopes, and ions are core topics of quantum chemistry <a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>and computing.</p>
			<h3>Molecules</h3>
			<p>A molecule <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>is the smallest unit of matter that maintains the chemical properties of a substance. Molecules <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>are composed of two or more atoms and/or isotopes of atoms. They are considered the smallest building blocks of substances that maintain the chemical properties of more than one molecule of the substance. Molecules can also be ions as they can also lose and gain electrons. A molecule is one of the mos<a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>t basic units of matter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>1.3. Quantum numbers and quantization of matter</h1>
			<p>Quantization is <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>the concept that matter, particles, and other physical quantities, such as charge, energy, and magnetic spin, can have only certain countable values. These <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>certain countable values can be either discrete or <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>continuous variables. Discrete values are <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>defined as countable in a <em class="italic">finite</em> amount of time. Continuous values are defined as countable in an <em class="italic">infinite</em> amount of time. Whether or not a quantum system is discrete or continuous depends on the physical system or the observable quantity.</p>
			<p>We will discuss the particles that are most associated with quantum chemistry: protons, neutrons, electrons, and hydrogen atoms. The neutrons and protons comprise the nucleus of atoms and are held together by the strong nuclear force, and they do not have a measurable angular momentum quantum number within the nucleus. In contrast, free protons and neutrons not bound within a nucleus can be in motion and then possess an angular momentum quantum number. Within a nucleus, all the protons and neutrons couple (or add) together with their given magnetic quantum numbers so that the nucleus has an overall magnetic quantum number. This is also true for the spin momentum (<img src="img/Formula_01_011.png" alt="" width="44" height="46"/> quantum number for these <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>particles, which for each is 1/2. In general, we consider the overall magnetic and <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>spin momentum quantum numbers of a nucleus and not the individual protons and neutrons of the nucleus.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25">Electron<a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>s in an atom</h2>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>five quantum numbers correspond to electrons in an atom:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The<a id="_idTextAnchor037"/> principal quantum number, <img src="img/Formula_01_012.png" alt="" width="28" height="25"/>, d<a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>escribes <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>the energy level or the electron's position in a shell of the atom and is numbered from 1 up to the shell containing the outermost electron of that atom. <a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Technically, <img src="img/Formula_01_013.png" alt="" width="27" height="27"/> can range from 1 to infinity, thus it is a continuous quantum number. However, as the electron is excited to higher and higher values of <img src="img/Formula_01_014.png" alt="" width="28" height="27"/>, and dissociates from the atom, it is then considered a free electron, and an ion. This process is called ionization, and <img src="img/Formula_01_015.png" alt="" width="29" height="29"/> is then considered discrete.</li>
				<li>The angular <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>momentum quantum number, <img src="img/Formula_01_016.png" alt="" width="16" height="38"/>,<a id="_idTextAnchor040"/> also kn<a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>own as <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>the orbital <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>quantum number or the azimuthal quantum number, describes the electron subshell and gives the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum throu<a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>gh the relation: <img src="img/Formula_01_017.png" alt="" width="300" height="50"/>. In chemistry and spectroscopy, <img src="img/Formula_01_018.png" alt="" width="100" height="35"/> is called the <img src="img/Formula_01_019.png" alt="" width="22" height="25"/> orbital, <img src="img/Formula_01_020.png" alt="" width="100" height="35"/> the <img src="img/Formula_01_021.png" alt="" width="25" height="33"/> orbital, <img src="img/Formula_01_022.png" alt="" width="100" height="35"/> the <img src="img/Formula_01_023.png" alt="" width="28" height="41"/> orbital, and <img src="img/Formula_01_024.png" alt="" width="100" height="36"/> the <img src="img/Formula_01_025.png" alt="" width="25" height="41"/> orbital. Technically, there are more orbitals beyond the <img src="img/Formula_01_026.png" alt="" width="25" height="42"/> orbital, that is, <img src="img/Formula_01_027.png" alt="" width="191" height="46"/>, <img src="img/Formula_01_028.png" alt="" width="188" height="35"/>, and so on, and are of higher energy levels.</li>
				<li>The magnetic <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>quantum number, <img src="img/Formula_01_029.png" alt="" width="53" height="35"/>, describes the electron<a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>'s energy level within its subshell and the orientation of the electron's orbital. It can take on integer values ranging from <img src="img/Formula_01_030.png" alt="" width="278" height="41"/>.</li>
				<li>The spin <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>quantum number, <img src="img/Formula_01_031.png" alt="" width="22" height="26"/>, varies for each particle type, an<a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>d there is no classical analog to describe what it is. The spin quantum number describes the intrinsic spin mome<a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>ntum of a certain particle type; for the electron, it is equal to 1/2.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">spin projection quantum number</strong>, <img src="img/Formula_01_032.png" alt="" width="56" height="34"/>, gives <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>the projection of the spin m<a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>omentum <img src="img/Formula_01_033.png" alt="" width="22" height="26"/> along the specified axis as either "spin up" (+½) or "spin down" (-½) in a given spatial direction. This direction in quantum computing is<a id="_idTextAnchor047"/> defined as the <img src="img/Formula_01_034.png" alt="" width="22" height="24"/>-axis.</li>

			<p>A wave function <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>is a math<a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>ematical tool that describes the state, or the motion, and the physical <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>properties of particles and matter. This concept is the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We will go into the details of this in <a href="B18268_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</em>. The variables of the wave function are the quantum numbers previously described, as well as position and time. The PEP ensures that the full wave function for a given system is complete and is different for fermions, bosons, and composite particles.</p>
			<h3>Fermions</h3>
			<p>In 1925, Wolfgang Pauli <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>stated that in a single atom, no two electrons can have an identical set of quantum numbers, <img src="img/Formula_01_035.png" alt="" width="28" height="25"/>, <img src="img/Formula_01_036.png" alt="" width="16" height="40"/>, <img src="img/Formula_01_037.png" alt="" width="53" height="37"/>, and <img src="img/Formula_01_038.png" alt="" width="56" height="34"/>. This principle was supplemented by stating that only antisymmetric pair permutations of the electronic wave function are allowed [Kaplan] [Dirac_2]. Antisymmetric refers to obtaining a minus sign (-) of the wave function upon applying the permutation operator to the wave function.</p>
			<h3>Bosons</h3>
			<p>The only possible <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>states of a system of identical bosons are those for which the total wave function is symmetric [Kaplan]. Symmetric refers to obtaining a plus sign (+) of the wave function upon applying the permutation operator wave function.</p>
			<h3>Composite particles</h3>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>general formulation of the PEP for all elementary particles also holds for composite particles [Kaplan]: <em class="italic">The only possible states of a system of identical particles possessing spin </em><img src="img/Formula_01_039.png" alt="" width="25" height="34"/><em class="italic"> are those for which the total wave function is symmetric for integer values of </em><img src="img/Formula_01_040.png" alt="" width="25" height="32"/><em class="italic"> (the Bose–Einstein statistics) and antisymmetric for half-integer values of </em><img src="img/Formula_01_041.png" alt="" width="25" height="33"/><em class="italic"> (the Fermi–Dirac statistics).</em></p>
			<h3>Dirac notation</h3>
			<p>Dirac notation <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>is also known <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>as bra-ket notation. The state of a quantum system, or the wave function, is represented by a ket, <img src="img/Formula_01_042.png" alt="" width="56" height="50"/>, which is a column vector of coordinates and/or variables. The bra, <img src="img/Formula_01_043.png" alt="" width="56" height="49"/>, denotes a linear function that maps each column vector to a complex conjugate row vector. The action of the row vector  <img src="img/Formula_01_044.png" alt="" width="53" height="41"/>on a column vector <img src="img/Formula_01_045.png" alt="" width="56" height="50"/> is written as <img src="img/Formula_01_046.png" alt="" width="100" height="50"/> . In <a href="B18268_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</em>, we will show how Dirac notation relates to the aforementioned quantum numbers. Dirac notation will be further explained and illustrated in <a href="B18268_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Quantum Circuit Model of Computation</em>.</p>

			<p>Light and energy <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>are fundamental t<a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>o the behavior of matter. In this section, we will outline how light and energy <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>are related to mass, momentum, velocity, wavelength, and frequency. We will also introduce electronic transitions of the hydrogen atom.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Planck constant and relation</h2>
			<p>In 1900, German physicist <a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Max Planck explained the spectral-energy distribution of radiation emitted by a black body by assuming that the radiant energy exists only in discrete quanta that <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>are proportional to the frequency. The Planck relation states that the energy (<img src="img/Formula_01_047.png" alt="" width="31" height="39"/>) of a photon is proportional to its frequency (<img src="img/Formula_01_048.png" alt="" width="25" height="27"/>) and inversely <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>proportional to the wavelength (<img src="img/Formula_01_049.png" alt="" width="25" height="35"/>): <img src="img/Formula_01_050.png" alt="" width="294" height="44"/>. <img src="img/Formula_01_051.png" alt="" width="25" height="34"/> is the Planck constant, <img src="img/Formula_01_052.png" alt="" width="84" height="42"/>6.62607015×10-34 Joule x Hertz-1 (J x Hz-1), with Hertz being defined as inverse seconds (Hz = s-1), and <img src="img/Formula_01_053.png" alt="" width="22" height="25"/> is the speed of light, which is equal to 299,792,458 meters per second (ms-1).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>The de Broglie wavelength</h2>
			<p>The de Broglie <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>wavelength formula relates the mass (<img src="img/Formula_01_054.png" alt="" width="41" height="26"/>), momentum <a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>(<img src="img/Formula_01_055.png" alt="" width="25" height="34"/>), and velocity (<img src="img/Formula_01_056.png" alt="" width="25" height="25"/>) of a particle to the wavelength (<img src="img/Formula_01_057.png" alt="" width="25" height="35"/>): <img src="img/Formula_01_058.png" alt="" width="238" height="104"/> , and it is the scale at which a particle behaves like a wave.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Heisenberg uncertainty principle</h2>
			<p>The uncertainty principle is related to the associated<a id="_idTextAnchor057"/> accuracy of measuring physical quantities. We define <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>the accuracy of measuring physical quantities using the standard deviation (<img src="img/Formula_01_059.png" alt="" width="28" height="26"/>), or average variance of a given set of measurements. The uncertainty principle asserts a lower bound on the accuracy for predicting certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle from initial conditions. The more accurately you know one quantity, the less you know about the other quantity.</p>
			<p>For instance, momentum (<img src="img/Formula_01_060.png" alt="" width="25" height="32"/>) and position (<img src="img/Formula_01_061.png" alt="" width="25" height="26"/>) are a pair of physical quantities that follow uncertainty such that if you know exactly where a particle is, the less you know about its momentum. Conversely, the more you know about its momentum, the less you know about exactly where it is.</p>
			<p>The standard deviation of position (<img src="img/Formula_01_062.png" alt="" width="47" height="41"/>) and the standard deviation of momentum (<img src="img/Formula_01_063.png" alt="" width="47" height="44"/>) are related by the following inequality, <img src="img/Formula_01_064.png" alt="" width="168" height="102"/>, where <img src="img/Formula_01_065.png" alt="" width="135" height="94"/> is the reduced Planck constant.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Energy levels of atoms and molecules</h2>
			<p>Transitions <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>between different electron energy levels<a id="_idTextAnchor059"/> in an atom, or <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>between different vibration or rotation energy levels in a molecule, occur by the processes of absorption, emission, and/or stimulated emission of photons. Only when the energy of a photon matches the exact difference in the energy between the initial and final states does a transition occur. In an atom, the energy associated with an electron is that of its orbital. High energy states close to when an atom is being ionized are called Rydberg states. An atomic or molecular orbital describes the probability of finding an electron at a given point in space in an atom or molecule. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>simplest atom, when a hydrogen atom absorbs a <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>photon of light, the electron jumps to a higher energy level, for example from <img src="img/Formula_01_066.png" alt="" width="122" height="36"/> to <img src="img/Formula_01_067.png" alt="" width="113" height="40"/>. Conversely, a photon is emitted when an electron jumps to a lower energy level, for instance from <img src="img/Formula_01_068.png" alt="" width="113" height="37"/> to <img src="img/Formula_01_069.png" alt="" width="113" height="35"/> [Byjus].</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Electron configuration</h2>
			<p>In the early 1920s, Niels Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli formulated the Aufbau principle (from German, <a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Aufbauprinzip, <em class="italic">building-up principle</em>), which states that electrons fill subshells of the lowest energy available <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>before filling subshells of higher energy. The Aufbau principle is based on the Madelung rule, which states that electrons fill the orbitals in order of increasing <img src="img/Formula_01_087.png" alt="" width="97" height="40"/> such that whenever two orbitals have the same value of <img src="img/Formula_01_088.png" alt="" width="97" height="38"/>, they are filled in order of increasing <img src="img/Formula_01_089.png" alt="" width="28" height="29"/>. The symbols <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>used for writing the electron configuration start with the energy level <img src="img/Formula_01_014.png" alt="" width="28" height="27"/> followed by the <strong class="bold">atomic orbital</strong> letter, and finally the superscript, which indicates how many electrons are in the orbital. For example, the notation for phosphorus (P) is 1<em class="italic">s</em>² 2<em class="italic">s</em>² 2<em class="italic">p</em>⁶ 3<em class="italic">s</em>² 3<em class="italic">p</em>³.</p>

			<p>Now that we've gone through all the key concepts of quantum chemistry, you have the foundation you need to understand how this relates to quantum computation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>1.5. A brief history of quantum computation</h1>
			<p>The first revolution was the formulation of the postulates in the early 1900s. Following the first revolution, in 1936, Alan Turing created a theoret<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>ical model for automatic machines, now called Turing machines, which laid <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>the theoretical foundations of computer science. In 1980, Paul Benioff published a paper that described a quantum mechanical model of Turing machines [Benioff]. With this and the advancements in quantum chemistry, the foundations were in place for quantum computers.</p>
			<p>The first time that quantum computation was discussed within the broader scientific community was when Richard Feynman gave a keynote lecture at a conference <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>called the Physics of Computation held in May 1981 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This keynote lecture discussed harnessing quantum physics to build a quantum computer [Preskill_40y]. In May 2021, on the anniversary of the conference, IBM organized an event called QC40: Physics of Computation Conference 40th Anniversary [QC40], celebrating the second quantum revolution.</p>
			<p>A few decades before the first conference, in 1964 John Stewart Bell published a paper "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox." He proved that there are no local hidden variables of quantum mechanics [Bell_1], an important development that paved the way for quantum information theory, with applications in quantum computing and quantum communication. This is the basis of using quantum advantage.</p>
			<p>Building on these ideas for quantum computation, in 1985, David Deutsch published a paper that laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation. He stated the Church–Turing–Deutsch principle, which is that a universal computing device can simulate every physical process. He also published the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm with Richard Jozsa in 1992, which is the first example of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm [Deutsch-Jozsa].</p>
			<p>Peter Shor created a polynomial-time quantum computer algorithm for integer factorization, which is now known as Shor's algorithm [Shor], in 1994. In 1996, Emanuel Knill and Raymond Laflamme developed a general theory of quantum error correction [Knill]. In 2000, David P. DiVincenzo discussed five requirements for the physical implementation of quantum computation and two more requirements pertaining to quantum communication [DiVincenzo]. In 2001, IBM researchers published an experimental realization of Shor's algorithm [Vandersypen].</p>
			<p>In 2014, an article by lead author Alberto Peruzzo et al. in Nature Communications introduced the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for finding an estimate of the ground state energy (lowest energy) of a molecule [VQE_1]. Please be reminded that the variational method was mentioned in <em class="italic">Section 1.1, Understanding thehistory of quantum chemistry and mechanics</em>. The IBM Quantum team used the VQE algorithm in 2017 to simulate the ground state energy of the lithium hydride molecule [VQE_2]. VQE algorithms are available on several platforms; for instance, Qiskit, enabling experimentation on a variety of quantum processors and simulators, which is used in this book. So far, at the time of this book being published, no claim has been made that a VQE algorithm has outperformed classical supercomputers in computational chemistry based on first principles (ab initio).</p>
			<p>On October 23, 2019, John Martinis, Chief Scientist Quantum Hardware, and Sergio Boixo, Chief Scientist Quantum Computing Theory, at Google AI Quantum published the results of a quantum supremacy experiment in the Nature article <em class="italic">Quantum Supremacy Using a Programmable Superconducting Processor</em> [Arute], which is a controversial claim and suggestion. Quantum supremacy is an experimental demonstration that a quantum computing device can perform a particular computation that no classical computer could do in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
			<p>In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, an ever-increasing number of actors from academia and <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>industry with massive funding programs take part in the so-called race to demonstrate a quantum advantage, either a computational speedup or a reduction in energy costs or both. Current quantum processors have limitations such as too few qubits and limited circuit depths. The goal is to obtain fault-tolerant devices that may need to leverage an advanced understanding of quantum chemistry.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>1.6. Complexity theory insights</h1>
			<p>Complexity theory has <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>two important facets: one is regarding the PEP and the use of the BO approximation, to which we dedicate part of <a href="B18268_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</em>; and two is the complexity of computation. This section describes the complexity of computation as it relates to quantum systems.</p>
			<p>In his keynote lecture at the Physics of Computation Conference at MIT in 1981 [MIT_QC_1981], Richard Feynman asked the question: "<em class="italic">Can a classical computer simulate either a classical system or a quantum system exactly?</em>" He also stated that the number of computer elements required to simulate a large physical system should only be proportional to the size of the physical system. Feynman pointed out that calculating the probability of each of <img src="img/Formula_01_105.png" alt="" width="31" height="40"/> particles of a large quantum system being at each of <img src="img/Formula_01_106.png" alt="" width="34" height="38"/>points require an amount of memory proportional to <img src="img/Formula_01_107.png" alt="" width="59" height="45"/>, that is, increasing exponentially with <img src="img/Formula_01_108.png" alt="" width="31" height="36"/>. His next question was whether a classical system could simulate probabilistically a quantum system. Using Bell's theorem, which rules out local hidden variables [Bell_1] [Bell_2], Feynman showed that the answer was again negative.</p>
			<p>Feynman suggested that quantum systems could simulate other quantum systems and he challenged <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>the computer scientists to work out the classes of different kinds of quantum mechanical systems that are intersimulatable — that is, equivalent — as has been done in the case of classical computers [Preskill_40y]. Computational complexity theory, a field of theoretical computer science, attempts to classify computational problems according to their resource usage, space, and time. </p>
			<p>In this theory, problems that can be solved in polynomial (P) time are in class P, problems for which an answer can be verified in polynomial time are in class nondeterministic polynomial (NP) [PvsNP], and problems for which no efficient solution algorithm has been found and it is easy to check that a solution is correct are in class NP-complete. For example, we do not know an efficient way to decompose a number into its prime components, while it is easy to check that the product of prime numbers is a solution. </p>
			<p>The question whether P = NP is in the list of seven Millennium Prize Problems [Clay].  Problems that can be solved by a quantum computer in polynomial time are in class BQP.</p>
			<p>In his 2008 article <em class="italic">The Limits of Quantum Computers</em> [Aaronson_1] [Aaronson_2], Scott Aaronson pointed out that a common mistake is to claim that, in principle, quantum computers could solve NP-complete problems by processing every possible answer simultaneously. We will explain in<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18268_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor153"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Molecular Hamiltonians</em>, that a quantum computer can process simultaneously all possible states of a quantum register prepared in superposition. The difficulty is to design algorithms that use quantum interference and <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>entanglement so that the quantum computer only gives the right answers. Scott Aaronson also manages a list of all the complexity classes, Complexity Zoo [Comp_Zoo]. Stephen Jordan manages a quantum algorithm zoo [Qa_Zoo].</p>
			<p>A new discovery in complexity theory establishes why the gradient descent algorithm cannot solve some kinds of problems quickly [Fearnley] [Daskalakis]. Training variational quantum algorithms is an NP-hard problem [Bittel]. These results impact all variational quantum algorithms, such as VQE, because they rely on a classical optimizer to optimize the set of parameters of a quantum circuit.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Using the postulates of quantum mechanics to understand both quantum chemistry and computing will help the next generation of scientists to predict the behavior of matter not yet measured experimentally. This is an exciting prospect for humanity, and we hope that the historical perspective provides a reference point for the current state of the industry revealing new opportunities for progress. There is a circular thought process between quantum chemistry, the use of quantum computing, and the use of both in conjunction.</p>
