- en: Now that the basics of creating and executing ArcPy scripts have been covered,
    we need to take the next step and create re-useable **Script tools**. Creating
    Script tools will allow for greater code reuse, and will make it easy to create
    custom tools for other GIS analysts and customers. With a Python script **backend**
    or code, and a familiar ArcGIS tool **frontend** or user interface, the particulars
    of the code are hidden from the user; it becomes just another tool, albeit a tool
    that can save days and weeks of work.

- en: The scripts we have generated in previous chapters have all had **hard-coded**
    inputs. The input values were written in the script as strings or numbers and
    assigned to variables. While they can be updated manually to replace the input
    and output file paths and SQL statements, programmers should aim to create scripts
    that will not require editing each time they are used. Instead, scripts should
    be designed to be dynamic and accept file paths and other inputs as parameters
    or arguments, in much the same manner that the functions we have created accept
    parameters.

- en: Python was designed with this in mind, and the `sys` module has a method called
    `sys.argv` that accepts inputs passed to the script when it is executed. While
    the designers of ArcPy and its predecessor `arcgisscripting module` initially
    took advantage of the `sys.argv` method, in time they designed an ArcPy method
    for accepting script parameters. As either method can be used when writing ArcPy
    scripts, and both are found in example scripts on the web, it is important to
    recognize the minute differences between the `sys.argv` method and `arcpy.GetParameterAsText()`.
    The major difference between the two methods is that `sys.argv` accepts the dynamic
    arguments as a list. Members of the list are accessed using list indexing and
    assigned to variables. `Arcpy.GetParameterAsText()` is a function that accepts
    an index number parameter. The index number passed reflects the order of the parameter
    within the tool's frontend; the first parameter is zero, the next is one, and
    so on.

- en: It is important to receive feedback from scripts to assess the progress of the
    script as it performs an analysis. As basic as this would seem, Python scripts
    and programming languages in general do not, by default, provide any feedback
    except for errors and the termination of the script. This can be a bit discouraging
    to the novice programmer, as all built-in feedback is negative.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To alleviate this lack of feedback, the use of print statements allows the script
    to give reports on the progress of the analysis as it runs. However, when using
    a Script tool, `print` statements do not have any effect. They will not be displayed
    anywhere, and are ignored by the Python executable. To display messages in the
    script console when Script tools are executed, ArcPy has a `arcpy.AddMessage()`
    method.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`Arcpy.AddMessage` statements are added to scripts wherever feedback is required
    by the programmer. The feedback required is passed to the method as a parameter
    and displayed; whether it be a list, string, float or integer. `Arcpy.AddMessage`
    makes it easy to check on the results of analysis calculations, to ensure that
    the correct inputs are used and that the correct outputs are produced. As this
    feedback from the script can be a powerful debugging tool, use `arcpy.AddMessage`
    whenever there is a need for feedback from the Script tool.'

    that we created in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Working with ArcPy Geometry
    Objects"), *Working with ArcPy Geometry Objects* `Chapter6_1.py`, as `Chapter7_1.py`
    in a new folder called `Chapter7`. We can then start replacing the hard-coded
    variables with dynamic variables using `arcpy.GetParameterAsText`. There is another
    ArcPy method called `GetParameter` that accepts the inputs as an object, but for
    our purposes, `GetParameterAsText` is the method to use.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By adding `arcpy`.`GetParameterAsText` and `arcpy.AddMessage` to the script,
    we will have taken the first step towards creating a Script tool. Care must be
    taken to ensure that the variables created from the dynamic parameters are in
    the correct order, as reordering them can be time-consuming. Once the parameters
    are added to the script and the hard-coded portions of the script replaced with
    variables, the script is ready to become a Script tool.
  id: totrans-19

    however, they are passed to a function individually instead of as a member of

    further processing must be applied to certain variables, as not all of them are
    going to be used as strings. In this case, a list is created from the string passed
    to the variable `keyfields` by using the `string` functions split and splitting
    the string on every semi-colon, while the `headers` variable is created by splitting
    on the commas. To other variables, such as the `censusBlockField` variable and
    the variable keyfields, the `SHAPE@` keyword is added because it will be required
    each time the analysis is run. If a particular field is required for each run
    of the data, such as the `BLOCKID10` field, it can remain hard-coded in the script,
    or optionally could become its own selectable field parameter in the Script tool.

  zh: 如您从变量`keyfields`和变量标题中看到的那样，必须对某些变量应用进一步的处理，因为并非所有变量都将作为字符串使用。在这种情况下，通过使用`string`函数split和在每个分号上拆分传递给变量`keyfields`的字符串来创建一个列表，而`headers`变量是通过逗号拆分创建的。对于其他变量，如`censusBlockField`变量和`keyfields`变量，添加了`SHAPE@`关键字，因为每次运行分析时都需要它。如果需要为每次数据运行指定特定的字段，例如`BLOCKID10`字段，则它可以保留为硬编码在脚本中，或者可以选择成为脚本工具中可选择的字段参数。
- en: The variables will then be added to the remainder of the script in the correct
    places, making the script ready for the Script tool to become part of a custom
    Toolbox in a geodatabase or in ArcToolbox. However, we must first create the tool
    part of the Script tool for the values to be collected and passed to the script.
