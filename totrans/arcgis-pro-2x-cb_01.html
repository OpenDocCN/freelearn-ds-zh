<p>ArcGIS Pro represents a huge step forward in Desktop GIS. This new 64-bit solution allows GIS Professionals to take full advantage of modern computer hardware, which brings increased performance and capability that has not been available for the desktop. It also has a brand new modern ribbon interface. This is completely different from the toolbar-based interface we have become accustomed to in ArcMap or ArcCatalog. While more intuitive for completely new users, it can be a bit challenging for existing ArcGIS Desktop users.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will begin exploring ArcGIS Pro. You will first determine whether your computer has the capability to run this powerful software. Then you will determine which license levels are available to you. This is important as it will impact your ability to complete some of the recipes in this book.</p>
<p>You will then move on to working in ArcGIS Pro. You will start by learning how to open an existing ArcGIS Pro project. Then you will open and navigate a map. From there, you will learn methods for adding new layers and configuring some of their properties.</p>
<p>Finally, you will learn how to create a new project from the beginning. This will include adding new maps, and importing ArcMap map documents.</p>

<p>Unlike the 32-bit ArcMap and ArcCatalog applications, ArcGIS Pro supports hyperthreading (use of multiple core processors), graphics processing units, and more than 4 GB of RAM. This also means ArcGIS Pro requires more computer resources to run properly.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements for ArcGIS Pro 2.1 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 64-bit OS:
<ul>
<li>Windows 7, 8.1, or 10</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, or 2016</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hyperthreaded dual core processor</li>
<li>4 GB RAM</li>
<li>32 GB hard drive space</li>
<li>2 GB video memory</li>
<li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 11</li>
<li>DirectX 11</li>
<li>OpenGL 3.3</li>
<li>Shader Model 4.1</li>
<li>Pixel Shader 4.0</li>
<li>Vertex Shader 4.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that these are the minimum requirements. The more hardware the better where ArcGIS Pro is concerned. In general, I would recommend at least 12 GB of RAM, an i5 dual core processor, and a separate video card with its own GPU and memory. For a complete set of recommended hardware specifications, you may want to look at my other book from Packt Publishing, <em>Learning ArcGIS Pro</em>.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to use the system requirements tool to verify whether your computer can run ArcGIS Pro. This is a free tool provided by Esri.</p>

<p>Notice that you can see whether your system meets the minimum and recommended specifications for running ArcGIS Pro. If your system just meets the minimum specifications, you can expect ArcGIS Pro to run slowly and require the application to be restarted much more frequently.</p>
<p>If your system failed, you will need to upgrade the components or software that the reports indicate are below the required specifications. This might be as simple as updating your drivers or Internet Explorer. It might require you to purchase new hardware if your CPU, RAM, or video card fail to meet the minimum requirements.</p>
<p>If your system meets or exceeds the system requirements, you may download and install ArcGIS Pro.

            <article>
                
<p>ArcGIS Pro has three different license levels: Basic, Standard, and Advanced. The license level determines the level of functionality available to the user. Basic has the least functionality, Advanced has the most, and Standard is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>In general, Basic allows you to visualize GIS data, produce maps, perform simple data edits, and perform basic GIS data analysis. Standard builds on the capabilities of the Basic level, with more advanced editing and data validation tools. Advanced expands the capabilities of both Basic and Standard by adding more data analysis tools. For a complete list of the capabilities of each license level of ArcGIS Pro, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/license-levels.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/license-levels.htm</a>.</p>
<p>It important for you to know what license level you are using so you know what capabilities are available to you. Some recipes in this book will require a Standard or Advanced license. In this recipe, you will learn how you can determine your ArcGIS Pro license level.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you learned how to determine which license level of ArcGIS Pro you had access to. You did this by going to the <span class="packt_screen">About ArcGIS Pro</span> window from the ArcGIS Pro start window. From there, you accessed your license level information by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Licensing</span> option located on the left side.</p>
<p>The license level is important, as it determines what functionality you have access to within the program. As you will see in this book, some recipes will require you to have access to higher license levels.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Licensing</span> window allows you to do more than just see what license level and extensions have been assigned to you. It also allows you to determine what type of ArcGIS Pro licensing you want to use, check out a license for use in the field, and more.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro supports three basic types of licensing: single user, concurrent user, and named user. Named user is the default and requires you to have a username and password in your organization’s ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Portal. Single user licenses are the traditional software license, where the software is licensed to a single computer. Concurrent licenses are sometimes referred to as network licenses. These make use of a license manager that is typically installed on a server and controls how many users can be running the software at once.  To learn more about the types of licenses supported in ArcGIS Pro, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/licensing-arcgis-pro.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/licensing-arcgis-pro.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Before you can start working in ArcGIS Pro, you must first open a project. To open a project, you must navigate to where it is stored. In this recipe, if you installed the data in the default location, the project was stored on your computer's <kbd>C:\</kbd> drive in a series of folders, so that the full path was <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter1</kbd>. You were able to access this project by navigating to that location.  </p>

<p>Now that you know how to open an existing project, it is time to learn how to open a map stored within the project. Projects can contain 2D maps, 3D scenes, data connections, layouts, styles, toolboxes, and more. However, 2D maps are still the primary canvas that GIS professionals work with.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to open existing 2D maps. Once open, you will learn how to navigate within the map.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you began exploring the contents of a project by opening an existing map that was contained in a project that you opened in the last recipe. Once you opened the map from that <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, you began to navigate within it using the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tool. You used the Explore tool to first zoom in and out within the map. Then, you used the <span class="packt_screen">Full Extent</span> button to return to the full extent of the map view. Next, you used a book mark to zoom to <span class="packt_screen">Washington Park</span> in the map. From there, you zoomed into an even more specific area, using a combination of the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tool and the <em>Shift</em> key along with your mouse.</p>
<p>Once you zoomed into a block of parcels you were interested in, you used the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tool to retrieve information about a specific parcel.</p>

<p>Now you know how to start ArcGIS Pro and open a project so you can begin accessing functionality. You have learned how to open an existing map and navigate within the map. You can even see information about features displayed within the map using the Explore tool.</p>
<p>But how did those layers get added to the map? How did ArcGIS Pro know how to display the layers you saw within the map? That is your next step in your ArcGIS Pro journey.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn various methods for adding new layers to a map. You will then discover how to configure various properties associated with a layer, such as its name and symbology.</p>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>When you add a new layer to a map in ArcGIS Pro, the software will display the new layer using a random color. Also, it will automatically add the new layers to your map contents based on what type of layer it is. Point layers will be added to the top. Line layers will be added below points. Polygon layers will be added below the line layers. Raster layers are added below the polygons, and base maps are placed at the very bottom. In a map, the drawing order starts with the layers at the bottom of the list and draws each succeeding layer on top of the previous, so that the last layer drawn is the one on the top of the list.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this recipe, you started by adding new layers to a map. You added multiple layers at one time using the <span class="packt_screen">Add Data</span> button. Once you added the new layers, you began to adjust their properties so that they would be more useful within the map. First, you renamed the layer using a more descriptive and understandable name than the one originally associated with the feature class in the geodatabase. Then, you updated the metadata for the layer so others using the map would have a better understanding of its purpose.</p>
<p>After you updated some of the basic properties of the layers you added, you worked on the symbology so that the map was easier to read. You made the <span class="packt_screen">Streams</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Creeks</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Lakes</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Ponds</span> layers blue so they resembled the features they represent, also, people are accustomed to seeing them presented this way in a map. You made these adjustments by clicking the symbol patch located beneath each layer and then changing the symbol properties in the <span class="packt_screen">Symbology</span> pane.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Buildings</span> layer required a little more effort, because you needed to change the symbology so that you could tell each building type from within the map. This required you to base the symbology on an attribute of the buildings that was stored in a field found in the attribute table of the <span class="packt_screen">Buildings</span> layer. To do this, you went to the <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> tab and selected the <span class="packt_screen">Unique Values</span> symbology. Then, you configured this symbology type to use the <span class="packt_screen">Building Type</span> field from the attribute table for the layer. Once you pointed the symbology type to that field, it automatically created a unique symbol for each building type it found. In this case, it created a unique symbol allowing you to determine the type of buildings (for example, houses or apartments). </p>
<p>You added the <span class="packt_screen">Power Poles</span> layer from the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane by right-clicking the feature class within the geodatabase and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span>. You then adjusted the color of the <span class="packt_screen">Power Poles</span> symbol to red by right-clicking the symbol and selecting Mars Red from the presented color palette.</p>
<p>Finally, you created a <span class="packt_screen">Map File</span> based on the map you made, so you will be able add the map to other projects quickly and easily. The map will be added with all the layer properties and settings that you just configured, so you will not need to go through that process again. </p>

<p>We have mentioned several times that you must first open a project before you are able to access the functionality included in ArcGIS Pro. You have begun to experience this in the previous recipes where you opened and worked with existing projects. These were already configured, and contained several project items including maps and database connections. How were these projects created?  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a new project using one of the four project templates included with ArcGIS Pro. You will see the structure created by ArcGIS Pro when a new project is created.</p>

<p>To complete this recipe, all you need to do is ensure that you have ArcGIS Pro installed, access to a license, and the data for the book downloaded and installed. This recipe does not even require you to have completed the previous recipes, though it might help provide a better understanding of what you are doing.  </p>

</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should have noticed that your new project contains a single custom toolbox and file geodatabase that has the same name as your project. These were automatically created by ArcGIS Pro when you created the new project. You should have also noticed that several styles and locators were also automatically connected by default.</p>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">There are three basic types of geodatabase: personal, file, and SDE. ArcGIS Pro only supports file and SDE geodatabases. It does not support the personal geodatabase.

<p style="padding-left: 60px">This new project is missing several key elements that you will need to perform any GIS work. First, it is missing a map.

<p>In this recipe, you created your first new project. You used the <span class="packt_screen">Blank</span> template, which creates a very basic project for ArcGIS Pro. Projects created with the <span class="packt_screen">Blank</span> template include connections to a custom toolbox and geodatabase that have the same name as the project, along with several styles and locators. The toolbox and geodatabase are automatically created by ArcGIS Pro when you create the new project. They are both empty and are intended for you to save project-specific items to them. However, in most cases, your organization will already have an established GIS database.</p>
<p>Once you created your project, you added a connection to an existing geodatabase, <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS</span>. This database contains the GIS data for the City of Trippville that you used in other recipes. This is actually the primary database that you will use in the remainder of this book. So, you added it to your favorites and set it to automatically be added to all new projects you create.  </p>
<p>After you established a connection to the primary geodatabase, you imported a new map. This new map was based on a Map file you created in a previous recipe. The new map was added with layers already added and their properties configured, saving you a lot of effort.</p>

<p>In the last recipe, you created a new project using the <span class="packt_screen">Blank</span> template. As you saw, this template automatically created the project structure including a project geodatabase, custom toolbox, and more. The blank template is not the only one included with ArcGIS Pro. There are several others you can use when creating a new project. Let's take a quick look at them. </p>

<p>As you may have noticed when you created your new project, ArcGIS Pro includes three other project templates: Global Scene, Local Scene, and Map. Each of these will create slightly different projects:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Project items<br/>
that are created</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Map</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Creates a new project that automatically<br/>
includes a new 2D Map</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Project Toolbox</li>
<li>Project File Geodatabase</li>
<li>Project Map Geodatabase</li>
<li>2D Map</li>
</ul>
</td>

</td>

<ul>
<li>Project Toolbox</li>
<li>Project File Geodatabase</li>
<li>Project Scene Geodatabase</li>
<li>3D Local Scene</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Global Scene</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Creates a new project that automatically<br/>
includes a new global 3D Map, similar to<br/>
what you experience with Google Earth the first time you open it</p>
</td>

<ul>
<li>Project Toolbox</li>
<li>Project File Geodatabase</li>
<li>Project Scene Geodatabase</li>
<li>3D Global Scene</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition, connections to standard styles, locators, and any favorites that are set to add to new projects are also added to the items created, based on the selected new project template.</p>
<p>Using the skills that you have learned in the previous recipes, try creating a new project using a template other than Blank. See how they differ from one another.</p>
