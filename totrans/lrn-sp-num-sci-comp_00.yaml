- en: While maintaining the main structure of the first edition, this revised edition
    of *Learning SciPy for Numerical and Scientific Computing* includes a set of companion
    IPython Notebooks. This will help students, researchers, and practitioners modify
    and incorporate in their own work, the set of tested code snippets that are presented
    in the book, as the pedagogical strategy. This will also show and illustrate the
    computing power that SciPy brings to the fingertips of anyone interested in performing
    numerical computation via the unique flexibility offered by the Python computer
    language.

- en: We should mention, however, that the IPython Notebooks will make sense to anyone
    starting in the field only if they are read alongside the corresponding section
    in the book, helping you to develop skills in the use of SciPy to solve large
    scale numerical problems while gaining understanding of the conditions and limitations
    associated with the modules contained in SciPy. Certainly, the already knowledgeable
    reader will find pleasure as they encounter material they already know, but will
    be challenged to devise better ways to accomplish with the same level of clarity
    presented in the book with the many computational tasks used to illustrate the
    functionality of SciPy.

- en: SciPy has been an integral part of the computational environment of choice for
    many scientists for years. One of our challenges today is to bring together professionals
    with different backgrounds, technologies, and expertise in software (from the
    pure mathematician, to the hardcore engineer) to contribute independent of their
    working environments.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SciPy in Python is a perfect platform to coordinate projects in a smooth, reliable,
    and coherent environment. It allows performing most tasks with ease; reason being
    that many dedicated software tools easily integrate with the core features of
    SciPy, therefore, interfacing with non-Python-based software packages and tools
    is becoming increasingly simple.

- en: In summary, this book presents the most robust programming environment to date.
    We will show you how to use this system from basic manipulation of data, to a
    very detailed exposition through examples in different branches of science and
    engineering.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to SciPy"), *Introduction to
    SciPy*, shows the benefits of using the combination of Python, NumPy, SciPy, and
    matplotlib as a programming environment for scientific purposes. You will learn
    how to install, test, and explore the environments, use them for quick computations,
    and figure out a few good ways to search for help. A brief introduction on how
    to open the companion IPython Notebooks that comes with this book is also presented.'

    to SciPy"), *Working with the NumPy Array As a First Step to SciPy*, explores
    in depth the creation and basic manipulation of the object array used by SciPy,
    as an overview of the NumPy libraries.'

    Algebra*, covers applications of SciPy to applications with large matrices, including
    solving systems or computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. SciPy for Numerical Analysis"), *SciPy for
    Numerical Analysis*, is without a doubt one of the most interesting chapters in
    this book. It covers with great detail the definition and manipulation of functions
    (one or several variables), the extraction of their roots, extreme values (optimization),
    computation of derivatives, integration, interpolation, regression, and applications
    to the solution of ordinary differential equations.'

    Signal Processing*, explores construction, acquisition, quality improvement, compression,
    and feature extraction of signals (in any dimension). It is covered with beautiful
    and interesting examples from the field of image processing.'

    Mining*, covers applications of SciPy for collection, organization, analysis,
    and interpretation of data, with examples taken from statistics and clustering.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. SciPy for Computational Geometry"), *SciPy
    for Computational Geometry*, explores the construction of triangulation of points,
    convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and applications, including the solving of the
    two dimensional Laplace Equation via the Finite Element Method in a rectangular
    grid. At this point in the book, it will be possible to combine techniques from
    all the previous chapters to show state-of-the-art research performed with ease
    with SciPy, and we will explore a few good examples from Material Science and
    Experimental Physics.'

    with Other Languages*, introduces one of the main strengths of SciPy—the ability
    to interact with other languages such as C/C++, Fortran, R, and MATLAB/Octave.'

- en: This book is for scientists, engineers, programmers, or analysts with knowledge
    of Python. For some of the sections, a decent command over linear algebra, calculus,
    and some statistics is needed to understand some of the concepts, but otherwise
    this book is mostly self-contained.
