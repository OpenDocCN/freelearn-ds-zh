    learned how to access, visualize, convert, and maintain data using ArcGIS Pro.
    While these capabilities alone would make ArcGIS Pro a very powerful tool, those
    are by no means the limits of what you can accomplish with ArcGIS Pro.

- en: 'ArcGIS Pro is capable of performing some amazing analysis. These capabilities
    are generally broken down into four categories: overlay, proximity, network, and
    statistical. These can be further specialized as well. As was pointed out in [Chapter
    1](45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml), *ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology*,
    there are two things that determine what tools are available to you, license level
    and extensions. The license level will determine what core tools are available
    to you. The extensions will determine what specialized tools you will be able
    to access. So, it is always important to know what license level you are using
    and what extensions you have access to. Review [Chapter 1](45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml), *ArcGIS
    Pro Capabilities and Terminology*, for more information about license levels.'

- en: Let’s now focus on proximity analysis in ArcGIS Pro. Proximity analysis is simply
    determining how far or close features are from one another. This could be as simple
    as selecting features that are within a specified distance from other features,
    or as complex as calculating the distances between features in one or more layers.
    Examples of proximity analysis include creating a buffer around selected features
    to show the area around those features at a set distance. It might be calculating
    how far features in one layer are from features in another layer and writing those
    values to a data table. It might be determining which feature in one layer is
    the closest to a feature in another layer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you will get some first-hand experience of performing various
    types of proximity analysis. This will include creating buffers, selecting features
    based on distance, determining the nearest feature, and calculating how far features
    are from other features. Some of these recipes will require you to have an Advanced
    license for ArcGIS Pro.

    object id for the Water Quality Station. You should see a value of 3 or 4 which
    matches the object id for those stations in the attribute table for the Water
    Quality Stations that have a current status of Bad. The Near_FID field contains
    the object id of the nearby industrial-zoned parcel. Each water quality station
    should be paired with multiple parcels. The Near_Rank field identifies which is
    closest to each water quality station. This helps you prioritize which parcels
    you should begin with.

    yes. You can use the Spatial Join tool to accomplish something very similar. However,

    features. If you just want a table, you can then export the records from the results
    of the Spatial Join tool to a new table. Here is how all that works:'
