    data and metrics. They work because humans aren't as good at processing large,

    Good charts and graphs provide comparable data at a glance, in a way anyone can

    create jaw-dropping graphics. One popular JavaScript library you could use to
    create charts, graphs, and other data-driven visualizations is `D3.js`. `D3.js`
    was created by Mike Bostock of the New York Times to use HTML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript
    to create interactive data-driven graphics. It reads data from HTML and renders
    it in the way you decide.

    The library is very versatile in that it doesn''t render just charts and graphs.
    It provides the building blocks to create charts, graphs, and other interactive
    graphics that can move and be styled like any HTML element. Even GIS maps in different
    projections can be shown on a webpage using `D3.js` and a file format called GeoJSON.'

    methods, which are similar to the jQuery base method. D3 commands can be chained
    one after another, which is also a favorite feature with many jQuery developers.
    In the following example, we''re using D3 to find elements with the class `addflair`
    using the `select()` method. We then add spans to the elements with related text

    is to load them as AMD modules. You can treat them like any other Dojo-based module,
    and load them into memory only when necessary. This works well with libraries
    that you use sporadically and don't need at startup. It also works well with libraries
    that load all the functionality of the library into a single JavaScript object,
    such as `D3.js` or jQuery.

    Adding your external library to the packages will tell Dojo''s `require()` and
    `define()` functions where to look for the libraries. Remember that, when listing
    the location of the library in the package, you reference the file folder of the
    JavaScript library, not the library directly. For D3, the `dojoConfig` script

    get `class="ethnicgraph"`, for instance). This will cut down on the possibility
    of HTML `id` collision. Also, while Dojo widgets require either an HTML element

    our web mapping applications. The `dojox/charting` library comes with the ArcGIS
    JavaScript API, and is easily integrated with existing applications. It provides
    many themes that can be added quickly. On the other hand, `D3.js` works with HTML
    elements and CSS styling to create eye-popping effects. It offers more data visualization
    techniques than `dojox/charting` and offers customizable appearances using CSS
    styling. Your final choice may come down to your comfort level with these tools
