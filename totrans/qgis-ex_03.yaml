- en: Print maps are a great tool for sharing your spatial information because they
    can be included in presentations, publications, and reports as high-quality graphics
    or printed in a conventional way. QGIS has powerful capabilities of creating single-page
    or multipage (so-called atlases) maps that you can export in multiple, easy-to-distribute,
    and print graphical formats (for example, .pdf, .png, .svg, and so on).

    maps, called **print composer**, and will learn how to use it to get outstanding
    results.

    you to set up a layout and add a map and its necessary elements, such as text
    labels, the legend, the scale bar, and the north arrow. Moreover, you can significantly
    enliven your map by combining multiple overviews, images, drawings, and HTML labels.
    To simplify map generation and save your time, you can use map templates and the
    atlas generator functionality.

    generation functionality. The idea underlying atlases is very simple—very often,
    the user needs to generate several small maps, instead of one big map. To arrange
    multiple maps properly within several pages, an atlas coverage layer is used.
    This coverage layer may contain various types of geometry (points, lines, and
    polygons) that are used to define the general extent of the map, separate sheet's
    extents, their quantity, and their sequence. The most common example of an atlas
    is a large area (for example, a country, borough, or watershed basin) separated
    into several parts based on its subunits (for example, regions, states, counties,
    or subbasins).

    notice that the **Preview atlas** button in the **Atlas** toolbar is active. Click
    on it to generate your atlas. When the generation process completes, you will
    see that the other buttons on the toolbar have also become active. Click on them
    to preview the atlas pages.![Creating atlases](img/image00404.jpeg)Using the toolbar
    buttons, you can not only explore your atlas, which contains multiple pages created
    within minutes, but also get quick access to the **Print**![Creating atlases](img/image00405.jpeg),
    **Export**, and **Settings**![Creating atlases](img/image00406.jpeg) options.
    The **Export** options are shown in this screenshot:![Creating atlases](img/image00407.jpeg)

    map from scratch. As a result, they are overloaded with multiple map composers
    that have permanently changing maps. If you want to save your time, then it is
    wise to use **Lock layers for map item** and **Lock layer styles for map item**
    to block undesirable changes in your maps.

    print composer. Now you know that QGIS is not only a great tool for creating a
    simple print map, but it also provides sophisticated options to combine multiple
    maps into a single layout, relate them with overviews, and finally, generate multipage
    map atlases with a few clicks.
