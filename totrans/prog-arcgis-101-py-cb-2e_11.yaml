    of add-ins created with Python. **Add-ins** provide a way of adding user interface
    items to ArcGIS Desktop through a modular code base designed to perform specific
    actions. Interface components can include buttons, tools, toolbars, menus, combo
    boxes, tool palettes, and application extensions. The add-in concept was first
    introduced in ArcGIS Desktop 10.0 and could be created with .NET or Java. However,
    with the release of ArcGIS 10.1, add-ins can now be created with Python. Add-ins
    are created using Python scripts and an XML file that defines how the user interface
    should appear.
  prefs: []

- en: Add-ins provide an easy way to distribute user interface customizations to end
    users. No installation programs are necessary. A single compressed file with a
    file extension of `.esriaddin` is copied to a well-known folder, and ArcGIS Desktop
    handles the rest. To simplify the development even further, a Python Add-In wizard
    has been provided by Esri. You can download the wizard from the Esri website.
    We'll do that in our first recipe in this chapter.

- en: There are a number of add-in types that can be created. Buttons and tools are
    the simplest type of add-ins that you can create. Buttons simply execute business
    logic when clicked. Tools are similar to buttons but require interaction with
    the map before the business logic is executed. Combo boxes provide a list of choices
    for the user to select from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also a number of container objects including menus, toolbars, tool
    palettes, and application extensions. Menus act as a container for buttons or
    other menus. Toolbars are a container for buttons, tools, combo boxes, tool palettes,
    and menus. They are the most versatile of the add-in container types. Tool palettes
    also act as a container for tools, and need to be added to a toolbar before the
    tools will be exposed. Finally, application extensions are the most complex add-in
    type. This type of add-in coordinates activities between other components and
    is responsible for listening for and responding to various events, such as the
    addition or removal of a layer from a data frame.

    to edit the Python script associated with the button. You'll also want to test
    the button to make sure it works as expected. Finally, you can share the add-in
    with others. In this recipe, you'll learn how to use the Add-In wizard to create

    code the add-in. It performs whatever business logic needs to be performed by
    the buttons, tools, menu items, and so on. The `config.xml` file in the main folder
    of the add-in defines the user interface and any static properties such as the
    name, author, version, and so on. The `makeaddin.py` file can be double-clicked
    to create the `.esriaddin` file, which wraps everything into a compressed file
    with an `.esriaddin` extension. This `.esriaddin` file is what will be distributed

    similar to the following screenshot. Your map will vary though because the points
    are generated randomly:![How to do it...](img/4445_11_24.jpg)

- en: Tool add-ins are very similar to button add-ins, the difference being that tool
    add-ins require some sort of interaction with the map before the functionality
    is triggered. An interaction with the map can be a number of things including
    clicking on the map, drawing a polygon or rectangle, or performing various mouse
    or key events. Python code is written to respond to one or more of these events.
    In this recipe, you learned how to write code that responds to the `onRectangle()`
    event. You also set various properties inside the constructor for the add-in including
    `cursor` and `shape`, which will be drawn on the map.

- en: There are a number of additional add-ins that you can create. The `ComboBox`
    add-in provides a drop-down list of values that the user can select from, or alternatively
    they can type a new value into an editable field. As with the other add-ins, you'll
    first want to create a new project with the Python Add-In wizard, add a new toolbar,
    and then create a combo box to add to the toolbar.

    added to an existing toolbar. By default, tools will be added to the palette in
    a grid-like pattern.

    addition to being displayed by the ArcGIS Desktop Add-in Manager, will also be
    displayed in the **Customize** dialog box for ArcGIS Desktop.

- en: Application extensions are used to add specific sets of related functionality
    to ArcGIS Desktop. Several examples include Spatial Analyst, 3D Analyst, and Business
    Analyst. Typically, application extensions are responsible for listening for events
    and handling them. For example, you could create an application extension that
    saves the map document file each time a user adds a layer to the map. Application
    extensions also coordinate activities between components.
