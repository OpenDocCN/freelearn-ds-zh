- en: For data to be useful and meaningful, it must be curated and refined. *Data
    Wrangling with Python* teaches you all the core ideas behind these processes and equips
    you with knowledge about the most popular tools and techniques in the domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts with the absolute basics of Python, focusing mainly on data
    structures, and then quickly jumps into the NumPy and pandas libraries as the
    fundamental tools for data wrangling. We emphasize why you should stay away from
    the traditional way of data cleaning, as done in other languages, and take advantage
    of the specialized pre-built routines in Python. Thereafter, you will learn how,
    using the same Python backend, you can extract and transform data from a diverse
    array of sources, such as the internet, large database vaults, or Excel financial
    tables. Then, you will also learn how to handle missing or incorrect data, and
    reformat it based on the requirements from the downstream analytics tool. You
    will learn about these concepts through real-world examples and datasets.

- en: By the end of this book, you will be confident enough to handle a myriad of sources
    to extract, clean, transform, and format your data efficiently.
