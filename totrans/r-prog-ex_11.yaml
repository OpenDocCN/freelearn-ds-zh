    dependencies, which can either be installation or execution dependencies. We will
    go through the installation of each external dependency in the following sections.
    Installing external dependencies is not difficult, but it may be an unfamiliar
    process that requires us to do some work outside of R. Once we install these external
    dependencies successfully, installing R packages should be easy.

    what external dependencies you need before attempting to install an R package.
    Normally, you will simply try to install the package and see what happens. If
    no problems arise, then you are all set. If problems do arise, the output from
    the console will hint you into what you need to do next. Most of the time, a quick
    online search for the error or a look into the package's documentation will be
    enough to understand how to proceed. As you get more experience, you'll be able
    to quickly diagnose and solve any problems.

    and you can do so using the `library()` or `require()` functions, both of which
    take the name of the package you want to load as an argument.

    package were loaded into R by default, you may think you were using one function
    but really be using another. Even worse, it''s possible for there to be internal
    conflicts: two different packages may use the exact same functions names, resulting
    in strange and unexpected results. By only loading packages that you need, you
    can minimize the chance of these conflicts.'

  zh: 你可能想知道为什么需要将包加载到R中才能使用它们。如果每个包都默认加载到R中，你可能会认为你正在使用一个函数，但实际上却在使用另一个函数。更糟糕的是，可能存在内部冲突：两个不同的包可能会使用完全相同的函数名，导致出现奇怪和意外的结果。通过只加载你需要的包，你可以最小化这些冲突的可能性。
