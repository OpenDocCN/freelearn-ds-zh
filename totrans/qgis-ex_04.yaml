    platform, and you will learn how to use it to share your maps with others by publishing
    them on the Internet. We will cover all the necessary steps, such as creating
    a QGIS Cloud account, preparing your maps for publishing, filling metadata, restricting
    access to information, and publishing the map. Also, you will learn how to use
    this published map from a web browser, QGIS, and other desktop GISes.

    AG. Using this service, we can easily publish maps, share them with others, and
    even modify data—all this without any special knowledge, such as server setup
    and administration.

- en: QGIS Cloud is built using open source technologies. To store vector data, it
    uses PostgreSQL/PostGIS databases, maps rendered with the QGIS server, and a web
    viewer based on QGIS Web Client. As a result, it integrates very well with desktop
    QGIS. Layers stored on the cloud can be loaded and edited with QGIS. A published
    map will have the same look and feel as a local map created in QGIS.

    This introduces some disk usage overhead, as each empty database is about 11 MB
    in size, but such an approach also simplifies things a lot. For example, you can
    easily remove an unused map without losing data used in another map that is also
    stored in the same database. Of course, it is possible to keep many layers in
    a single database and use them in different maps, but this will lead to some complexity
    when you decide to remove some maps or layers.

    allows you to upload only local vector layers; local raster layer support is not

    instead.

    need a background map? Fortunately, QGIS allows you to add basemaps; all you need
    is to install the **OpenLayers plugin**. Once this plugin is installed, go to
    **Web** | **OpenLayers plugin** and add the desired background maps from the available
    list. It is possible to add several background maps, for example, OpenStreetMap
    and Bing, so that after publishing the project, users will be able to switch between
    them.

    and background maps. Remember, however, that the WMS layer will overlay the background
    map and may cover it completely. If you want to see the background map under the
    WMS layer, don't forget to set the transparency for the WMS layers before publishing.

    the deleted database. Make sure you have backups, or look at the previous section
    to learn how to delete separate layers.

    available in the database (provided that you haven't deleted the database first).
    So, if you don't need this data, it is necessary to delete the database too, unless
    it is being used by other maps. If you are using the same database to store data
    for different maps, you can delete separate layers with any PostgreSQL client,
    as described in the *Deleting layers with DB Manager* section.

- en: In this chapter, we covered how to publish our maps online using QGIS Cloud
    hosting from QGIS. We saw how to prepare projects for publishing, including specifying
    project metadata, restricting access to some layers and composers, hiding layer
    attributes, and defining allowed actions. Also, you learned how to access a published
    map from different programs and how to manage your QGIS Cloud account.

    Cloud账户。
