    with GeoPackages. This is the default format for storing GIS data in QGIS 3.4\.
    Instead of the many extensions that a Shapefile has, a GeoPackage can have hundreds
    of layers contained in one file, making it simpler to share and manage.

    add attributes to a attribute table and use the Field Calculator to calculate
    the area of a polygon. We will briefly discuss the use of scratch layers and exporting
    our data to a Shapefile. Finally, we will look at how raster data is imported
    into a GeoPackage.

    vector data operation that we perform can be applied to a Shapefileâ€”at the end

    a Shapefile (you can also export to a number of other formats; see [https://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html](https://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html)).
