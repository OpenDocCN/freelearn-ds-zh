    supplies or goods from one location to another. We’ll introduce a goods delivery
    problem to find the optimal routing of supplies to minimize the delivery time
    and cost to deliver the goods. We’ll explore shortest paths, optimal routes to
    visit all necessary locations, and scaling algorithms to large networks. Further,
    we’ll examine caveats to simple distance weightings to calculate route optimality,
    considering delivery hazards on routes that can influence optimality.

    of goods between locations represents an important problem in industries such
    as consumer-packaged goods, retail, military, and manufacturing. **Supply chain
    logistics**—the science of acquiring, transporting, and storing resources—influences
    many aspects of business in these industry sectors. Without goods to sell, a company
    cannot turn a profit. Without materials to manufacture goods, products cannot
    be made or transported to vendors.

    long waits for goods in many parts of the world or facing higher prices for necessities
    such as food. Crises such as the Ukraine war can leave entire countries short
    of food, creating humanitarian crises in other areas. Many supply chain logistics
    problems can be formulated through the lens of network science, and graph theory
    offers several useful tools to plan out the best routes to stock goods or materials
    across locations. In this chapter, we’ll learn more about supply chain logistics
    and leverage tools from graph theory to plan supply routes between grocery stores.

    the seven bridges of Königsberg, Germany. In 1736, Leonhard Euler posited that
    a route that crossed each bridge to a region next to one side of a bridge exactly
    once did not exist. Indeed, this is the case. If there is one more region than
    the number of bridges for an odd number of bridges, a trip is possible without
    traversing bridges more than once. Note that the proof of this is beyond the scope
    of this book; if you are interested, you can find many proofs online if you search

    used to estimate the cost of reaching a given destination by traversing the network.
    While Dijkstra’s algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path, the A* algorithm
    is not guaranteed to find the shortest path. On large, dense networks, however,
    it is not feasible to run Dijkstra’s algorithm, so A* must be used.

    4** to **store 5**. Again, with a much larger network, we’d need an algorithm
    such as the A* algorithm to find the shortest route quickly. Even a network of
    20 stores with several connections among stores would be problematic to compute
    by hand from a visualization of the network. We’ve seen how algorithms can help
    us find the shortest paths between two specific destinations. Let’s now take a
    look at the shortest paths that include stops at several different vertices. This
    type of solution is critical to many optimal routing problems and builds on our
    problem of finding the shortest paths between two different destinations.

    the traveling salesman problem for optimal route planning on our two store networks
    to see how connectivity impacts route length. Finally, we considered optimal cuts
