In fact, Big Data is a broad buzzword that encompasses a lot of components, and NoSQL database is an indispensable component of it.</p><p>Cassandra is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. Nowadays, it offers a vast number of technological advantages that enable you to break through the limits of a traditional relational database in a web-scale or cloud environment. However, designing a high-performance Cassandra data model is not an intuitive task, especially for those of you who have been so involved with relational data modeling for many years. It is too easy to adopt a suboptimal way to simply mimick a relational data model in Cassandra.</p><p>This book is about how to design a better model that leverages the superb scalability and flexibility that Cassandra provides. Cassandra data modeling will help you understand and learn the best practices to unleash the power of Cassandra to the greatest extent.</p><p>Starting with a quick introduction to Cassandra, we will guide you step-by-step from the fundamental data modeling approach, selecting data types, designing data model, and choosing suitable keys and indexes to a real-world application by applying these best practices.</p><p>Although the application is small and rudimentary, you will be involved in the full development life cycle. You will go through the design considerations of how to come up with a flexible and sustainable data model for a stock market technical-analysis application written in Python. Business changes continually and so does a data model. You will also learn the techniques of evolving a data model in order to address the new business requirements.</p><p>Running a web-scale Cassandra cluster requires many careful thoughts, such as evolving of the data model, performance tuning, and system monitoring, which are also supplemented at your fingertips.</p><p>The book is an invaluable tutorial for anyone who wants to adopt Cassandra in practical use.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Bird's Eye View of Cassandra">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Bird's Eye View of Cassandra</em>, explains what Big Data and NoSQL are and how they are related to Cassandra. Then, it introduces the important Cassandra architectural components and the features that come along with them. This chapter lays the fundamental knowledge, concepts, and capabilities that all the following chapters refer to.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Cassandra Data Modeling">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Cassandra Data Modeling</em>, explains why data modeling using Cassandra is so different from the relational data modeling approach. The commonly used technique in making a Cassandra data model, modeling by query, is explained with ample examples in more detail.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. CQL Data Types">Chapter 3</a>, <em>CQL Data Types</em>, walks you through the Cassandra built-in data types, with many examples that compose of a data model. The internal physical storage of these data types is also provided in order to help you understand and visualize what is going on in Cassandra.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Indexes">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Indexes</em>, discusses the design of the primary and secondary indexes. Cassandra data model is based on the queries to be used in order to access them. Primary and secondary indexes are different from those with the same names in a relational model, which often causes confusion to many new Cassandra data modelers. This chapter clearly explains when and which of them can be used correctly.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. First-cut Design and Implementation">Chapter 5</a>, <em>First-cut Design and Implementation</em>, conducts the design of the data model for a simple stock market technical-analysis application. This chapter starts by defining the business problem to be solved, the functions to be provided, and proceeds to design the data model and the programs. By the end of this chapter, the technical-analysis application can run on Cassandra to provide real functions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Enhancing a Version">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Enhancing a Version</em>, describes a number of enhancements on the technical-analysis application built in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. First-cut Design and Implementation">Chapter 5</a>, <em>First-cut Design and Implementation</em>. The enhancements involve both data model and code changes. This chapter illustrates how Cassandra's data model can flexibly embrace the changes.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Deployment and Monitoring">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Deployment and Monitoring</em>, discusses several important considerations to migrate an application on Cassandra from a non-production environment to a production one. The considerations include replication strategy, data migration, system monitoring, and basic performance tuning. This chapter highlights these pertinent factors in a real-life production Cassandra cluster deployment.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Final Thoughts">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Final Thoughts</em>, supplements additional topics in application development with Cassandra, such as client drivers that are available for different programming languages, built-in security features, backup, and restore. It also recommends a few useful websites for further information. Finally, a quick review of all the chapters wraps up the book.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The readers are advised to go through Cassandra basics before starting the journey of developing a data model and an application. An excellent book to start with is <em>Learning Cassandra for Administrators</em>, <em>Vijay Parthasarathy</em>, <em>Packt Publishing</em>.</p><p>Though having prior knowledge of Cassandra is not mandatory, anybody with some background in any application design and implementation and relational data modeling experience will find it easy to relate to this book.</p><p>The book refers to the recent Cassandra 2.0.<em>x</em> Version. Some of the code examples refer to the features available in Cassandra Query Language 3 (CQL3).</p><p>In addition, as Python is used to develop the sample application, an elementary programming knowledge of Python and NumPy is sufficient for a smooth read of this book. The preferred Python Version is 2.7.<em>x</em>. A good book to familiarize yourself with Python and NumPy is <em>NumPy Cookbook</em>, <em>Ivan Idris</em>, <em>Packt Publishing</em>.</p><p>All the tools and packages required to get the sample up and running are freely available on the Internet. To get a hands-on experience of the sample application, a computer running on Ubuntu Linux is suggested.</p></div>
