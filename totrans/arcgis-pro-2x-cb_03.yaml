- en: You now know that GIS data includes more than just what you may see in a map.
    Each layer has additional information linked to it which is stored in an Attribute
    Table. Also, not all data you display in a map is stored in a traditional GIS
    format. Some may be stored in standalone tables or even spreadsheets. These can
    also be displayed in a map if they include an address or *x* and *y* coordinates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there is a lot data out there in various databases which may not have
    *x* and *y* coordinates, or an address, or even be part of our GIS, but we need
    to be able to use that information to perform queries, display information, or
    conduct analysis in the GIS. This data may come from other systems, such as tax
    appraisal, permitting, inspections, work order, and asset management systems.
    If we want to use data stored in these systems we must be able to link it to our
    GIS data. ArcGIS Pro provides a couple of methods to do this, Join and Relate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At other times, we may need to transfer or link data together that is in our
    GIS. ArcGIS Pro supports several tools which allow you to do this, including a
    Spatial Join and creating relationship classes within a geodatabase.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you will learn the steps needed to link data in ArcGIS Pro
    to increase the capabilities of your datasets. You will learn how to create and
    use joins and relates. You will perform a spatial join to combine attributes between
    two layers based on a spatial relationship. Lastly, you will learn how to create
    and configure a relationship class within a geodatabase. You will start with a
    simple relationship class by creating an annotation feature class which is linked
    to another layer. Then you will create a relationship class manually, which will
    link two feature classes together.

    Joins link two datasets together to create a single virtual dataset within a single
    map in a project. This allows you to use the joined data to query, label, and
    symbolize using the information from both joined datasets.

- en: In this recipe, you joined the Owners table to the Parcels table. ArcGIS Pro
    links these two tables together, based on a key field in each table. The key fields
    are not required to have the same name, but must have the exact same values and
    be the same data type. ArcGIS Pro then compares the two tables and where the values
    are identical, it adds those fields and values to the primary table in the map.
    Where the values are not identical, it leaves the field values for the joined
    fields blank or null.

- en: The Join only exists in the map in which you create it. It will not be applied

    comes from other systems or datasets which will not be maintained in your GIS
    directly, such as the Owners table, which is maintained in the County’s CAMA system.
    You just get an updated download of the data on a regular basis and replace the
    old table with the new one, so that when you open the map which contains the join,
    you always see the most current available information.

    the name of the watershed it is located within. This is for an annual report the
    sewer superintendent must submit to the state every year. You have the boundary
    of the existing watersheds in your area and you have layers for the sewer lines

- en: You have now seen how to link data together based on a common key field using
    a Join or Relate, based on a spatial relationship. These methods are extremely
    useful. However, they do have limitations. Joins and Relates only exist in a single
    map and do not transfer easily to other maps or projects. Spatial Joins create
    new feature classes or tables while still leaving the original data unaltered.
    So, is there a way to permanently link two tables or two feature classes together?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is yes, if the data is all in the same geodatabase. In a geodatabase,
    you can create a relationship class. A relationship class permanently links data
    together and the link carries over into any map, scene, or project you use the
    data in. You can create a relationship class between two feature classes, two
    standalone tables, or a feature class and a standalone table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Relationship classes provide greater flexibility than the other methods we have
    looked at in previous recipes. Not only can you link data together so you can
    access the additional information, the related data can also impact the behavior
    or contents. For example, if I relate a sewer line feature class to a manhole
    feature class, the relationship class can be configured to allow information such
    as an attribute value from one feature class to also pass to another, or if I
    delete a feature in one feature class it deletes the connected feature in the
    other feature class.

- en: ArcGIS Pro supports two types of text display in a map or scene. The first is
    labels. Labels are dynamic text which is tied to a specific layer and attributes
    associated with that layer. The user can configure some settings which the computer
    will use when trying to determine where to place the label or if one will be placed
    at all. However, users are not able to individually place a label and guarantee
    it will always appear or be in a consistent location. The computer makes the final
    decision. Labels are extremely useful because they do automatically adjust as
    your map view changes in size or location. Annotation is the other method for
    displaying text. Annotation is fixed text, which can be individually placed and
    modified. This provides much greater control over the text, allowing you to put
    it exactly where and how you want it. Its big disadvantage is that it is more
    labor intensive to maintain and will not work at all scales. Feature Linked Annotation
    is the best of both worlds. It provides the control of annotation with some of
    the dynamic behavior of labels, as you will see in this recipe.

    joins and relates, the relationship class relies on a key field from the Attribute
    Tables for both feature classes to establish a basic link between the text features
    in the annotation layer and the feature that the text references in the other
    feature class. In the case of feature linked annotation, the key field was automatically
    determined and the relationship class configured when you converted the labels
    for the street centerlines to annotation using the Convert to Annotation tool.

- en: Feature Linked annotation takes advantage of the additional functionality the
    relationship class allows.  In addition to relating the two features classes together
    so you can located related features or records, it also allows you to push changes
    from the feature to the annotation. This is called a **composite relationship**.
    In a composite relationship, the existence or values of the origin feature controls
    or changes the existence or values of the destination feature or record. You saw
    this demonstrated when you changed the street name for the centerline and deleted
    the centerline, which caused changes to the street annotation layer.

- en: You have seen the power of a relationship class in the previous recipe. You
    saw how linking two feature classes together allowed you to not only access information
    about the linked features but also control some behavior. However, this was all
    automatically set up by the Convert to Annotation tool. In many cases, the data
    you wish to link together already exists. So how do you create a relationship
    class which would link that existing data together?
  prefs: []

- en: In this recipe, you will create a relationship class between a feature class
    and a standalone table. This will be between the same parcel layer and sales table
    you related in the *Creating and using a Relate* recipe earlier in this chapter.
     However, once you establish the relationship class, the link becomes permanent,
    unlike the relate which is limited to the map in which it was created.

    Pro. A Basic license does not support this level of functionality. If you are
    not sure what license you have, you can check it by doing the following. Open
    ArcGIS Pro, and on the bottom left of the start window, where you would normally
    select a project to open, click on About ArcGIS Pro. Then select Licensing from
    the list on the left. This will display the license level available, to you and
    any extensions you may have access to as well.

    a higher license is not available you can request a trial license from Esri by
    going to their website, at [http://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial).
    This will provide you with access to an Advanced license for ArcGIS Pro and more.
