<span class="emphasis"><em>Spark for Python Developers</em></span> aims to combine the elegance and flexibility of Python with the power and versatility of Apache Spark. Spark is written in Scala and runs on the Java virtual machine. It is nevertheless polyglot and offers bindings and APIs for Java, Scala, Python, and R. Python is a well-designed language with an extensive set of specialized libraries. This book looks at PySpark within the PyData ecosystem. Some of the prominent PyData libraries include Pandas, Blaze, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh. These libraries are open source. They are developed, used, and maintained by the data scientist and Python developers community. PySpark integrates well with the PyData ecosystem, as endorsed by the Anaconda Python distribution. The book puts forward a journey to build data-intensive apps along with an architectural blueprint that covers the following steps: first, set up the base infrastructure with Spark. Second, acquire, collect, process, and store the data. Third, gain insights from the collected data. Fourth, stream live data and process it in real time. Finally, visualize the information.</p><p>The objective of the book is to learn about PySpark and PyData libraries by building apps that analyze the Spark community's interactions on social networks. The focus is on Twitter data.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up a Spark Virtual Environment">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Setting Up a Spark Virtual Environment</em></span>, covers how to create a segregated virtual machine as our sandbox or development environment to experiment with Spark and PyData libraries. It covers how to install Spark and the Python Anaconda distribution, which includes PyData libraries. Along the way, we explain the key Spark concepts, the Python Anaconda ecosystem, and build a Spark word count app.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building Batch and Streaming Apps with Spark">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building Batch and Streaming Apps with Spark</em></span>, lays the foundation of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Data Intensive Apps Architecture</em></span>. It describes the five layers of the apps architecture blueprint: infrastructure, persistence, integration, analytics, and engagement. We establish API connections with three social networks: Twitter, GitHub, and Meetup. This chapter provides the tools to connect to these three nontrivial APIs so that you can create your own data mashups at a later stage.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Juggling Data with Spark">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Juggling Data with Spark</em></span>, covers how to harvest data from Twitter and process it using Pandas, Blaze, and SparkSQL with their respective implementations of the dataframe data structure. We proceed with further investigations and techniques using Spark SQL, leveraging on the Spark dataframe data structure.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Learning from Data Using Spark">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning from Data Using Spark</em></span>, gives an overview of the ever expanding library of algorithms of Spark MLlib. It covers supervised and unsupervised learning, recommender systems, optimization, and feature extraction algorithms. We put the Twitter harvested dataset through a Python Scikit-Learn and Spark MLlib K-means clustering in order to segregate the <span class="emphasis"><em>Apache Spark</em></span> relevant tweets.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Streaming Live Data with Spark">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Streaming Live Data with Spark</em></span>, lays down the foundation of streaming architecture apps and describes their challenges, constraints, and benefits. We illustrate the streaming concepts with TCP sockets, followed by live tweet ingestion and processing directly from the Twitter firehose. We also describe Flume, a reliable, flexible, and scalable data ingestion and transport pipeline system. The combination of Flume, Kafka, and Spark delivers unparalleled robustness, speed, and agility in an ever-changing landscape. We end the chapter with some remarks and observations on two streaming architectural paradigms, the Lambda and Kappa architectures.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Visualizing Insights and Trends">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Visualizing Insights and Trends</em></span>, focuses on a few key visualization techniques. It covers how to build word clouds and expose their intuitive power to reveal a lot of the key words, moods, and memes carried through thousands of tweets. We then focus on interactive mapping visualizations using Bokeh. We build a world map from the ground up and create a scatter plot of critical tweets. Our final visualization is to overlay an actual Google map of London, highlighting upcoming meetups and their respective topics.</p></div></div>
