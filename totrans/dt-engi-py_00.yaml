- en: Data engineering provides the foundation for data science and analytics and
    constitutes an important aspect of all businesses. This book will help you to
    explore various tools and methods that are used to understand the data engineering
    process using Python.The book will show you how to tackle challenges commonly
    faced in different aspects of data engineering. You’ll start with an introduction
    to the basics of data engineering, along with the technologies and frameworks
    required to build data pipelines to work with large datasets. You’ll learn how
    to transform and clean data and perform analytics to get the most out of your
    data. As you advance, you’ll discover how to work with big data of varying complexity
    and production databases and build data pipelines. Using real-world examples,
    you’ll build architectures on which you’ll learn how to deploy data pipelines.

    data modeling techniques, and will be able to confidently build data engineering
    pipelines for tracking data, running quality checks, and making necessary changes
    in production.
