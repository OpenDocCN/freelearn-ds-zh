- en: In *Mastering Predictive Analytics with Python*, you will work through a step-by-step
    process to turn raw data into powerful insights. Power-packed with case studies
    and code examples using popular open source Python libraries, this volume illustrates
    the complete development process for analytic applications. The detailed examples
    illustrate robust and scalable applications for common use cases. You will learn
    to quickly apply these methods to your own data.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. From Data to Decisions – Getting Started
    with Analytic Applications"), *From Data to Decisions – Getting Started with Analytic
    Applications*, teaches you to describe the core components of an analytic pipeline
    and the ways in which they interact. We also examine the differences between batch
    and streaming processes, and some use cases in which each type of application
    is well-suited. We walk through examples of both basic applications using both
    paradigms and the design decisions needed at each step.'

    in Python"), *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization in Python*, examines
    many of the tasks needed to start building analytical applications. Using the
    IPython notebook, we''ll cover how to load data in a file into a data frame in
    pandas, rename columns in the dataset, filter unwanted rows, convert types, and
    create new columns. In addition, we''ll join data from different sources and perform
    some basic statistical analyses using aggregations and pivots.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Finding Patterns in the Noise – Clustering
    and Unsupervised Learning"), *Finding Patterns in the Noise – Clustering and Unsupervised
    Learning*, shows you how to identify groups of similar items in a dataset. It''s
    an exploratory analysis that we might frequently use as a first step in deciphering
    new datasets. We explore different ways of calculating the similarity between
    data points and describe what kinds of data these metrics might best apply to.
    We examine both divisive clustering algorithms, which split the data into smaller
    components starting from a single group, and agglomerative methods, where every
    data point starts as its own cluster. Using a number of datasets, we show examples
    where these algorithms will perform better or worse, and some ways to optimize
    them. We also see our first (small) data pipeline, a clustering application in
    PySpark using streaming data.'

    Methods"), *Connecting the Dots with Models – Regression Methods*, examines the
    fitting of several regression models, including transforming input variables to
    the correct scale and accounting for categorical features correctly. We fit and
    evaluate a linear regression, as well as regularized regression models. We also
    examine the use of tree-based regression models, and how to optimize parameter
    choices in fitting them. Finally, we will look at a sample of random forest modeling
    using PySpark, which can be applied to larger datasets.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Putting Data in its Place – Classification
    Methods and Analysis"), *Putting Data in its Place – Classification Methods and
    Analysis*, explains how to use classification models and some of the strategies
    for improving model performance. In addition to transforming categorical features,
    we look at the interpretation of logistic regression accuracy using the ROC curve.
    In an attempt to improve model performance, we demonstrate the use of SVMs. Finally,
    we will achieve good performance on the test set through Gradient-Boosted Decision
    Trees.'

    Data"), *Words and Pixels – Working with Unstructured Data*, examines complex,
    unstructured data. Then we cover dimensionality reduction techniques such as the
    HashingVectorizer; matrix decompositions such as PCA, CUR, and NMR; and probabilistic
    models such as LDA. We also examine image data, including normalization and thresholding
    operations, and see how we can use dimensionality reduction techniques to find
    common patterns among images.'

    and Unsupervised Features"), *Learning from the Bottom Up – Deep Networks and
    Unsupervised Features*, introduces deep neural networks as a way to generate models
    for complex data types where features are difficult to engineer. We''ll examine
    how neural networks are trained through back-propagation, and why additional layers
    make this optimization intractable.'

    the results of predictive modeling with other users or software systems.'

    of the model change over time.'
