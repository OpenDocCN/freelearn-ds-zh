                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You now know that GIS data includes more than just what you may see in a map. Each layer has additional information linked to it which is stored in an Attribute Table. Also, not all data you display in a map is stored in a traditional GIS format. Some may be stored in standalone tables or even spreadsheets. These can also be displayed in a map if they include an address or <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates.  </p>
<p>However, there is a lot data out there in various databases which may not have <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates, or an address, or even be part of our GIS, but we need to be able to use that information to perform queries, display information, or conduct analysis in the GIS. This data may come from other systems, such as tax appraisal, permitting, inspections, work order, and asset management systems. If we want to use data stored in these systems we must be able to link it to our GIS data. ArcGIS Pro provides a couple of methods to do this, Join and Relate.</p>
<p>At other times, we may need to transfer or link data together that is in our GIS. ArcGIS Pro supports several tools which allow you to do this, including a Spatial Join and creating relationship classes within a geodatabase.    </p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn the steps needed to link data in ArcGIS Pro to increase the capabilities of your datasets. You will learn how to create and use joins and relates. You will perform a spatial join to combine attributes between two layers based on a spatial relationship. Lastly, you will learn how to create and configure a relationship class within a geodatabase. You will start with a simple relationship class by creating an annotation feature class which is linked to another layer. Then you will create a relationship class manually, which will link two feature classes together.   </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Joining two tables</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Join is one of two basic methods which can be used to link data in ArcGIS Pro. Joins link two datasets together to create a single virtual dataset within a single map in a project. This allows you to use the joined data to query, label, and symbolize using the information from both joined datasets.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will join the Parcel layer to a table which contains a list of owner names. You will learn the requirements needed to join two tables and how to complete the join. </p>

<p>For this recipe, you will need to ensure that you have installed the book data and have ArcGIS Pro installed. An ArcGIS Pro Basic license level will be sufficient for this recipe.</p>

<ol>
<li>To begin, you will need to start ArcGIS Pro.</li>
<li>In the ArcGIS Pro start window, click on Open another project.</li>
<li>Select Computer from the Open window and then click Browse in the area on the right:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-821 image-border" height="417" src="img/387b3e86-65c1-4db8-a245-abaa85a2fd6c.png" width="584"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Navigate to <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter3\Joining Data</kbd> by clicking on C:\ in the area on the left of the Open Project window. Then double-click on Student, ArcGISProCookbook, Chapter3, and Joining Data folders.</li>
<li>Select the Joining Data.aprx project file and click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The project will open with a single map named City of Thomasville. The map contains two layers, City Limits and Parcels, plus the Topographic basemap. First you will review the information contained in the Attribute Table for the Parcel layer.  </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>In the Contents pane, right click on the Parcels layer and select Attribute Table from the menu that appears. The Attribute Table for the Parcels layer should open in a window located at the bottom of the map view.</li>
</ol>
<div><img height="320" src="img/eb92faeb-8057-4c50-ac0f-e29b6d558afc.png" width="588"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Take a moment to look at the fields the Attribute Table contains, and answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What fields does the Parcels Attribute Table contain?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the table contains information about the parcel, such as the <strong>Parcel Identification Number</strong> (<strong>PIN</strong>), RealKey, OwnerKey, and more. It does not, however, contain any information about who owns the parcels. However, you do know that information is available in the <strong>Computer Aided Mass Appraisal</strong> (<strong>CAMA</strong>) system located in the Tax Appraisal Office for the County.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">They have provided you with a table of all the land owners in the County. You now need to join it to your Parcels layer.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>In the Catalog pane, normally located on the right side of the interface, expand the Databases folder by clicking on the small arrowhead to the left.</li>
<li>Expand the Thomaston.gbd so that you can see its contents. You should see at least three feature classes (CityLimits, Parcels, and Street_CL) and a couple of stand-alone tables (Owners and Parcels_Sales).</li>
<li>Right-click on the Owners table and select Add to Current Map.</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-822 image-border" height="360" src="img/3740f774-d297-4758-b4dc-91d0a4a39cbc.png" width="377"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The newly added table should appear in your Contents pane at the bottom of the list. Now you will look at the data contained within this newly added table.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>In the Contents pane, right click on the Owner table you just added and select Open. The Owners table should open in the same area as the Parcels Attribute Table.</li>
<li>Review the Owners table, paying close attention to what fields it contains. Then answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What fields does the Owner table contain?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: </p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, this table does have information about all the land owners in the County. However, it does not have any information about the parcels they own. In order to join the Owner information to the Parcels, you must identify a <strong>key field</strong>. A key field is a field in each table which contains data common to the two tables you are attempting to link. Now you will identify a key field in each table, which you will use to link them together.</p>
<div><p>Key fields are not required to have the same names in both tables. The names can be different. However, they must be the same data type and contain the same data values. By the same data values, that means they must be exactly the same. This includes capitalization and the number of spaces if the key fields contain text. This why it is often best to use numeric values if possible.</p>
</div>
<ol start="13">
<li>In the table view area, click on the tab at the top of the table which says Owners. Hold your mouse button down and begin to drag it downward. A series of icons should appear in the middle of the table view. Drag your mouse to the icon which has the filled beige area located on the right side as shown ahead. Then release your mouse:</li>
</ol>
<div><strong><img height="319" src="img/2e7744a1-9462-4f86-9efe-845ffb6fab57.png" width="616"/></strong></div>
<p>Click on Owners tab and drag to docking icon</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now see the two tables side by side, as shown in the following image. This allows you to see data in both tables at the same time. </p>
<div><strong><img height="204" src="img/2bf17ff9-5db2-4513-b0cc-d8f1d38c3ac6.png" width="605"/></strong></div>
<p>Two tables docked side by side</p>
<div><p>In ArcGIS Pro, you can actually drag the tables out so that they are viewable individually in their own window. These individual windows can then be positioned anywhere in your display, including on other monitors. They can also be sized individually as well. This can make it easier to view the multiple tables at one time.  </p>
</div>
<ol start="14">
<li>In the Parcels table, right click on the Ownerkey field and select Sort Descending.</li>
<li>In the Owners table, right click on the OwnKey field and select Sort Descending.</li>
<li>Review and compare the values for these fields in each table, then answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: These two fields appear to contain the same values?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you have verified the two fields contain like values, you need to verify the field types are the same.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Right-click on the OwnerKey field in the Parcels table and select Fields from the menu that appears:</li>
</ol>
<div><strong><img height="274" src="img/f34e048e-3b9c-42fc-bb18-23cadda19827.png" width="445"/></strong></div>
<ol start="18">
<li>Perform the same operation on the OwnKey in the Owners table.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your table view should now look like this:</p>

<p>Table design views side by side</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Verify that the Data Type is the same for the Ownerkey field in the Parcels table and the OwnKey in the Owners table.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the fields are both a Double data type. Since the fields contain the same data values and the field types are the same, these fields can be used to link the two tables. Now, it is time to link them.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Close the Tables and the Fields tab by clicking on the small X.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>It is not required to close the tables before joining them. You can leave them open if desired. It is just cleaner to close them before you join, to reduce screen clutter.</p>

<li>Using the scroll bar at the bottom of the Parcels table, scroll through the table fields.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What do you see now that you have joined the Parcel and Owners table?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the fields that were on the Owners table have now been added to the Parcels Attribute Table. Now that those fields have been added, you can use that information to locate all parcels owned by a specific owner, or label parcels with the owner. Let’s put that to the test.  You will start with labeling the parcels with fields from the joined table in the next recipe.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Close the Parcels table by clicking on the small X in the tab which shows the table name.</li>
<li>Click on the Project tab in the ribbon, and click on Save, located in the panel on the left side.</li>
<li>If you are continuing to the next recipe, keep ArcGIS Pro open. If you are not you may close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, you joined the Owners table to the Parcels table. ArcGIS Pro links these two tables together, based on a key field in each table. The key fields are not required to have the same name, but must have the exact same values and be the same data type. ArcGIS Pro then compares the two tables and where the values are identical, it adds those fields and values to the primary table in the map. Where the values are not identical, it leaves the field values for the joined fields blank or null.</p>
<p>The Join only exists in the map in which you create it. It will not be applied to other maps within the ArcGIS Pro project. It is also not permanently applied to the feature class or table. Join works best when you want to link data which comes from other systems or datasets which will not be maintained in your GIS directly, such as the Owners table, which is maintained in the County’s CAMA system. You just get an updated download of the data on a regular basis and replace the old table with the new one, so that when you open the map which contains the join, you always see the most current available information.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Labeling features using a joined table</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now that you have learned how to join tables, and seen how it links them to provide more information, what can you do with that information? In short, you can do anything with the joined information that you can do with the normal attributes in the layers Attribute Table.  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how you label features using the data from the joined table. You will label each parcel with its PIN and Owner Name. You will use the new Arcade language to do this. You will learn more about Arcade in <a href="6de6f9c1-9e73-4d0d-98b3-1b27818c49c5.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Introducing Arcade</em>.   </p>

<p>In this recipe, you labeled the parcels in the map with values from the PIN field in the Parcels Attribute Table and the LASTNAME field in the Owners table which you had joined to the parcels in the last recipe. You did this using Esri’s new Arcade expression language.</p>
<p>In the first part of your expression, you added descriptive text which allowed users to know what the labeled values were. You did this in Arcade by using double quotes. This tells ArcGIS Pro to simply display the text values found inside the double quotes. For example, your expression contained <kbd>“PIN: “</kbd>. This produced a label which showed up in the map a <kbd>PIN:</kbd> .</p>
<p>This was then followed up with a reference to a database field. In Arcade, you did this using the <kbd>+</kbd> to indicate another part of the expression, followed by <kbd>$feature[‘Parcels.PIN]</kbd>. This displays the value found in the PIN field within the Parcels Attribute Table. The <kbd>+</kbd> sign must be used between each part of the expression. You then displayed the owner name on another line in the label using <kbd>Textformatting.Newline</kbd> in your expression.  Once you set the owner name to be displayed on a separate line, you add more descriptive text by including <kbd>“Owner: “</kbd> in your expression. Lastly, you displayed the owners name by calling to the LASTNAME field in the joined Owners table by including <kbd>$feature[‘Owners.LASTNAME’]</kbd> at the end of your expression. This produced a label for each parcel that looked like this in the map:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIN: <kbd>T22 028</kbd></li>
<li>Owner: <kbd>Unknown</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>You then adjusted several configuration settings for the labels in the Label Class pane to make the labels fit in the parcels better and to be easier to read. You did this by setting the placement option to Land parcel placement. This automatically applies some settings that are preconfigured in ArcGIS Pro for placing text within a parcel. This cleaned up several of the overlapping labels, but left many parcels without a label.</p>
<p>So, next you set the positioning to be Straight in a polygon as opposed to the default Horizontal in a polygon. This allows ArcGIS Pro to fit labels diagonally within the polygon if needed, first adjusting the size of the font. This allowed ArcGIS Pro to label a few more parcels, but still not all of them.</p>
<p>Next, you moved over to the Fitting Strategy to adjust the font size for your labels. You enabled Reduce font size. This allowed ArcGIS Pro to automatically resize the font within the parameters you designated to help fit the label within the parcels. By making this adjustment you were able to get all the parcels in the view labeled.  </p>

<p>Labeling is not the only thing you can do with a joined table. You can also use the joined information to perform queries and analysis. In this recipe, you will perform a query to locate all the parcels owned by the City of Thomaston. You will then export that information to a spreadsheet using a geoprocessing tool.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you queried all the parcels owned by the City of Thomaston and then exported the selected list to a spreadsheet. To query the parcels owned by the City, you created an SQL where clause using the query builder. This allows you to create SQL expressions without having to know SQL.</p>
<p><strong>SQL</strong> stands for <strong>Structured Query Language</strong>. SQL is the standard language used by databases to communicate. It allows you to perform many functions within a relational database. Where clauses allow you to select records (or features within a GIS) which meet specific criteria. In the recipe you just completed, the criteria was where the Parcels owner equaled the City of Thomaston, thus why it is called a where clause. Like all languages, SQL has a specific syntax which must be followed to work. The ArcGIS Pro query builder you used knows the syntax and automatically creates the proper expression based on the parameters you provide. You used the Create Feature Class geoprocessing tool to generate the new shapefile. After you created the new shapefile, you added attribute fields to the table, which will store additional information about the street signs.</p>
<p>After you selected the parcels owned by the City of Thomaston, you exported them to a spreadsheet using the Table to Excel python script tool found in the Conversion toolbox and Excel toolset. Python is a scripting language which has been heavily integrated in to the ArcGIS platform. Python scripts can be created to assist with automating and streamlining workflows. To learn more about using Python with ArcGIS, we recommend <em>Programming ArcGIS with Python Cookbook, 2nd Edition</em> by Eric Pimpler from Packt Publishing.  </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating and using a Relate</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A Join is just one of the basic methods you can use in ArcGIS Pro to link data together. Another method is a Relate. A Relate links two tables together, but unlike a Join, which adds information to the primary table, the two tables remain separate when related. This allows you to see all the related records in the linked table.</p>
<p>A Relate works best when you have one record in your primary table which matches to multiple records in the linked table, or when you have multiple records in the primary that match multiple records in the linked table. In these situations, a Join would not work as well because it would have multiple records which match.   </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a Relate between the Parcels and a land sales table. The land sales table contains all parcels sales which have occurred over the last several years. This table also comes from the County’s CAMA system, like the Owners table did. Once you relate the two tables, you will see how you can view all the sales for a selected parcel.   </p>

<li>Right-click on the Parcels_Sales table and select Open.</li>
<li>Using the skills you learned in the previous recipe, try to determine the key field in each table which you will use to link the two tables together. Remember the key fields must contain the same data values and be the same field data type. The field names do not need to be the same.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the key field in each table?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: </p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">After reviewing each table, the key field should be fairly easy to pick out. The Realkey is the only field in each table which has the same data values and the same data type. </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>In the Parcels Attribute Table, right-click on the Realkey field and select Sort Descending.</li>
<li>In the Parcels Attribute Table, locate the records with a Realkey value of 15812.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You could also use the Select by Attribute tool to create a query which would select all parcels with a Realkey value of 15812.</p>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: How many rows in the table contain a Realkey value of 15812?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>In the Parcels_Sales table, right-click on the REALKEY field and select Sort Descending.</li>
<li>In the Parcels_Sales table, locate the rows with a REALKEY value of 15812. You will need to scroll down until you see that value, or you could use the Select by Attribute tool to select the records.</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: How many records in the Parcels_Sales table have a REALKEY value of 15812?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now know that there is one parcel and two sales records which have a realkey value of 15812. This means that you have a one to many cardinality, which works well with a Relate. Now you need to configure the Relate to link the Parcels to the Parcels_Sales table.  </p>
<div><p><strong>Cardinality</strong> refers to how many records in one table match to records in another table, based on a comparison of values found in a key field. There are four types of cardinality, one to one, one to many, many to one, and many to many. This relationship between records in the two tables can impact how you are able to work with them. Traditionally, with older Esri software such as ArcMap, if you had a one to one or a many to many, you would always want to use a Join. If you had a one to many or a many to many, you would always want to use a Relate. This is not the case with ArcGIS Pro. ArcGIS Pro offers more flexibility so you can choose either a Join or a Relate depending on how you need to use the data.  </p>

<p>As was mentioned earlier in this recipe, the cardinality was a major consideration when choosing whether you should use a Join or a Relate to link tables when using older Esri applications such as ArcMap. In ArcMap, you should always use a Join if you have a one to one or a many to one cardinality. However, if you have a one to many or many to many, you should use a relate in ArcMap otherwise you will miss data because the result would be a joined table that contained Null values or just the values from the first record it finds that matches.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro does not work that way. You can Join two tables regardless of the cardinality as long as they are in the same database. If you join two tables in ArcGIS Pro that have a one to many or a many to many cardinality, you see all the matched records. ArcGIS Pro does this by creating virtual records in the table view for each match, as shown ahead:</p>
<div><img height="404" src="img/97e5d7bf-fff1-4de8-851e-281aa94a4848.png" width="482"/></div>
<p>Single parcel selected but two records displayed in Attribute Table</p>
<p>As you can see, you have a single parcel selected but two records are shown in the table view for the layer. This is because the Parcels_Sales table was joined to the Parcels Attribute Table. As you saw in the recipe, there is a one to many cardinality between these tables. So, there are two sales associated with the selected parcel in the Parcel_Sales table, and both are displayed.</p>
<p>In ArcGIS Pro, this method of joining tables with one to many and many to many has other advantages. You are able to label features with values from each record in the joined table. This is something ArcMap users are unable to do. However, remember this only works with tables in the same database. If the tables are in two different databases or are different formats such as linking a spreadsheet to a geodatabase feature class, then the normal rules about when to use a join and when to use a relate still apply.</p>
<p>If you wish, use the skills you have learned in this and the previous recipe to join the Parcel_Sales table to the Parcels layer. Then explore how this join works by selecting several parcels while looking at the Attribute Table.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Joining features spatially</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So in the previous recipes, you have seen how you can link external data to layers or other tables using a Join or a Relate. However, what if you want to transfer data from one layer to another but there is no key field to use to link the data. Maybe the two layers in question overlap one another, or are next to one another, or share some other spatial relationship, surely there should be some way to link or join the two layers together based on a spatial relationship.</p>
<p>You can join two layers together based on a spatial relationship. This is called a <strong>Spatial Join</strong>. A Spatial Join creates a new feature class which adds the attributes from the joined feature class to the target feature class based on a spatial relationship you define when you run the tool. It is not required that the target and joined feature classes be the same type. You can spatially join lines with polygons, or points with lines, or points with polygons, as well as those of the same feature type.</p>
<p> When you run the Spatial Join tool you can specify the Join Operation. This determines how joins between the target features and join features will be handled in the output feature class if multiple join features are found that have the same spatial relationship with a single target feature. The options for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>JOIN_ONE_TO_ONE: When this option is chosen, if a single feature in the target layer matches to multiple features in the join layer because they have the same spatial relationship, the attributes from all the matched join features will be aggregated based on the field map merger rule you configure. For example, if you set the target layer to be the road centerlines and a road centerline crosses two wetland polygons which are in your join layer, the attributes from the two wetland polygons will be aggregated before being transferred to the output line feature class. If one wetland polygon has an area value of 2 acres and the other has an area value of 5 acres, and a Mean merge rule is specified, the aggregated value in the output feature class will be 3.5.</li>
<li>JOIN_ONE_TO_MANY: When this option is chosen, if a single feature in the target layer is found to match with multiple features in the join layer because they have same spatial relationship, the resulting output feature class will contain multiple records representing the single target feature and each match it has with features in the join layer. Using the same example as previous, if a single road centerline crosses two wetland polygons, the output feature class will contain two road centerlines: one will have the attributes from one of the wetland polygons it crossed and the second will have the attributes from the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this recipe, you have been asked to assign each sewer line and sewer manhole the name of the watershed it is located within. This is for an annual report the sewer superintendent must submit to the state every year. You have the boundary of the existing watersheds in your area and you have layers for the sewer lines and sewer manholes, so you will use the Spatial Join geoprocessing tool to assign the name of each watershed to the sewer features that are inside it.   </p>

<strong>Question</strong>: How does the new table compare to the Attribute Table for the Sewer Manhole and the Watersheds layers?<br/>
<strong><br/>
<br/>
Answer</strong>:</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you should hopefully see, the new layer contains the combined attributes of both the sewer manholes and watersheds layers. The output was a new point layer because the target was the sewer manholes, which was a point layer.</p>

<p>You have now seen how a spatial join can be used to merge data in two different layers into a single layer or feature class. This can increase the types of analysis you can perform on the data or how you can display it. Remember, when you perform a spatial join, it does create a new data layer. This means that your original data is still intact for you to use as well. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating feature linked annotation</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have now seen how to link data together based on a common key field using a Join or Relate, based on a spatial relationship. These methods are extremely useful. However, they do have limitations. Joins and Relates only exist in a single map and do not transfer easily to other maps or projects. Spatial Joins create new feature classes or tables while still leaving the original data unaltered. So, is there a way to permanently link two tables or two feature classes together?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, if the data is all in the same geodatabase. In a geodatabase, you can create a relationship class. A relationship class permanently links data together and the link carries over into any map, scene, or project you use the data in. You can create a relationship class between two feature classes, two standalone tables, or a feature class and a standalone table.</p>
<p>Relationship classes provide greater flexibility than the other methods we have looked at in previous recipes. Not only can you link data together so you can access the additional information, the related data can also impact the behavior or contents. For example, if I relate a sewer line feature class to a manhole feature class, the relationship class can be configured to allow information such as an attribute value from one feature class to also pass to another, or if I delete a feature in one feature class it deletes the connected feature in the other feature class. </p>
<p>One of the easiest relationship classes to create is called <strong>Feature Linked Annotation</strong>. In this recipe, you will create feature linked annotation and then explore its behavior.</p>

<p>To complete this recipe, you will need a Standard or Advanced license of ArcGIS Pro. A Basic license does not support this level of functionality. If you are not sure what license you have, you can check it by doing the following. Open ArcGIS Pro, and on the bottom left of the start window, where you would normally select a project to open, click on About ArcGIS Pro. Then select Licensing from the list on the left. This will display the license level available to you and any extensions you may have access to as well.</p>
<p>If you only have a Basic license, check with your account administrator to see if they can assign you a Standard or Advanced license at least temporarily. If a higher license is not available, you can request a trial license from Esri by going to their website, at <a href="http://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial">http://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial</a>. This will provide you with access to an Advanced license for ArcGIS Pro and more.</p>

<li>Click on the Map tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>At the far-right end of the Map tab, click on the Convert To Annotation button. This will open the Convert Labels to Annotation tool in the Geoprocessing pane.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>ArcGIS Pro supports two types of text display in a map or scene. The first is labels. Labels are dynamic text which is tied to a specific layer and attributes associated with that layer. The user can configure some settings which the computer will use when trying to determine where to place the label or if one will be placed at all. However, users are not able to individually place a label and guarantee it will always appear or be in a consistent location. The computer makes the final decision. Labels are extremely useful because they do automatically adjust as your map view changes in size or location. Annotation is the other method for displaying text. Annotation is fixed text, which can be individually placed and modified. This provides much greater control over the text, allowing you to put it exactly where and how you want it. Its big disadvantage is that it is more labor intensive to maintain and will not work at all scales. Feature Linked Annotation is the best of both worlds. It provides the control of annotation with some of the dynamic behavior of labels, as you will see in this recipe.</p>

<ol start="18">
<li>The new StreetNames layer you just created should appear in the Contents pane if the tool runs successfully. If the new layer does appear, close the Geoprocessing pane.</li>
<li>Now, let’s look at what you created. In the Contents pane, expand the StreetNames layer by clicking on the small arrow located next to the layer name.</li>
<li>Select the Street_CenterlinesAnno layer. Right-click on it and select Properties from the bottom of the context menu that appears.</li>
<li>Select the Source option from the list on the left panel in the Layer Properties window, then answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the data type and feature type for the new layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What database is the feature class that the layer references named and where is it located?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the name of the feature class you created which is referenced by the new layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see when you answer the preceding questions, the Convert to Annotation tool created not only a new layer in your map, but also a new feature class within the geodatabase. It is an annotation feature class which is a specialized version of a standard Polygon feature class; basically it acts like a text box. Like all feature classes, an annotation feature class is another form of vector data. As such, it has both the spatial component as well as an attribute component.</p>
<ol start="22">

<li>Right-click on the Street_CenterlinesAnno layer in the Contents pane. Select Attribute Table from the context menu which appears.</li>
<li>Take a moment to explore the Attribute Table for the new layer you just created, then answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: What attribute fields are in the table for the Street_CenterlineAnno layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>

<li>Set the Street Centerlines and Street_CenterlinesAnno layers as selectable and all others as not selectable. Those with a check mark in the box are selectable layers and those without a check mark are not. To change the status from selectable or not selectable simply click on the box next to the layer name.</li>
<li>Click on the Select tool in the Map tab in the ribbon. If you click on the drop-down arrow, select Rectangle.</li>
<li>Click just to the southeast of Pine St, in the map. Continue to hold your mouse button down and move your pointer just to the northwest of Pine St as shown in the following screenshot, so you select both the street centerline and the road name.</li>

<li>Right-click on the Street Centerline layer in the Contents pane and select Attribute Table from the context menu that appears.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the table view, click on the Show Selected Records button to only display the attributes for the street centerline you have selected.</li>
<li>Look at the attribute values for the selected street. Pay special attention to the value for the ObjectID.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="32">
<li>Ensure the Street Centerlines layer is still selected in the Content pane, then click on the Data tab in the Feature Layer contextual menu in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Select the Related Data button in the Relationship group on the Data tab in the ribbon. Choose the Anno_80_85:Street_CenterlinesAnno option that appears. The numbers identifying the relationship may be different. This should open the Attribute Table for the Street_CenterlinesAnno layer and select the related annotation record.</li>
<li>Review the attribute values for the selected record, then answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div><p><strong>Question</strong>: Which fields for the Street_CenterlinesAnno layer contain similar values as those for the street centerline you have selected?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your comparison of the values for the selected street centerline and the related annotation should have revealed that the Object ID for the street centerline matched the FeatureID value for the annotation, and the ST_NAME value for the street centerline matched the TextString value for the annotation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The two feature classes are linked to one another in the relationship class using the ObjectID of the Street Centerlines and the FeatureID of the Annotation as the key field, similar to how you used a key field to create both a join and a relate in previous recipes. As you will see next, the ST_NAME field and TextString fields are also linked as part of the relationship class.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Ensure that you still have the Pine St centerline selected, and then click on the Edit tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the Attributes button located in the Selection group on the Edit tab.</li>

<li>In the window at the top of the Attributes pane, select the Street Centerlines layer. This should display a list of all attributes associated with Pine St in the area below where you selected the layer.</li>
<li>Click in the cell located next to ST_NAME, which currently contains the value <kbd>PINE ST</kbd> and type <kbd>OAK AVE</kbd>. Hit your <em>Enter</em> key when done.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Notice what happens to the annotation for the street name in the map. It should have also changed because the ST_NAME field is linked to the TextString field for the annotation layer. Changing the ST_NAME value in the Street Centerlines layer automatically updates the value for the annotation layer because of the relationship class you created. For feature linked annotation, this is a one way relationship. This means the change is only pushed from the Street Centerlines layer to the Street_CenterlinesAnno layer, but not from the Street_CenterlinesAnno layer to the Street Centerlines.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>While on the Edit tab, click the Clear button in the Selection group to clear your selection.</li>
<li>In the Contents pane, right-click on the Street Centerlines layer and select Make this the only selectable layer.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>You may need to make sure you are still looking at the List by Selection option in the Contents pane.</p>
</div>
<ol start="41">
<li>Choose the Selection tool from the Selection group in the Edit tab on the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the street centerline for the newly renamed Oak Ave, which was formerly Pine St.</li>
<li>With Oak Ave selected and only Oak Ave selected, press your <em>Delete</em> key or click on the <em>Delete</em> button in the Features group on the Edit tab in the ribbon.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Notice that the annotation is also deleted when you delete the street centerline for Oak Ave. The relationship class not only links fields together, but also creates a link between the features in each feature class, so that by deleting the centerline it also deletes all related annotation features. Like the field relationship you explored earlier, this is only a one-way relationship. This means that if you were to delete the annotation it would not delete the related street centerline.</p>
<div><p>Not all relationship classes are a one-way relationship. Feature linked annotation is just one example of how a relationship class works. They can be configured in several different ways, depending on what you wish to accomplish.</p>
</div>
<ol start="44">
<li>On the Edit tab in the Manage Edits group, select Discard to discard all edits you have made.</li>
<li>In the Catalog pane, expand the Databases folder so you see the two geodatabases connected to the project.</li>
<li>Expand the Trippville_GIS.gdb geodatabase to see its contents.</li>
<li>Now expand the Base feature dataset and examine its contents. You should see the two feature classes which were referenced by the two layers you have been working with, Street_Centerlines and Street_CenterlinesAnno. You should also see the relationship class which you created when you created the feature linked annotation layer, Anno_80_85. Again, the name of your relationship class may have different numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the feature classes and relationship classes exist as objects in your geodatabase, they may be used in other maps, scenes, or projects. This provides much greater flexibility than the joins and relates you performed in past recipes.  </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As you saw in this recipe, feature linked annotation links text in one layer to the features in another layer. It does this using a relationship class. Like joins and relates, the relationship class relies on a key field from the Attribute Tables for both feature classes to establish a basic link between the text features in the annotation layer and the feature that the text references in the other feature class. In the case of feature linked annotation, the key field was automatically determined and the relationship class configured when you converted the labels for the street centerlines to annotation using the Convert to Annotation tool.</p>
<p>Feature Linked annotation takes advantage of the additional functionality the relationship class allows.  In addition to relating the two features classes together so you can located related features or records, it also allows you to push changes from the feature to the annotation. This is called a <strong>composite relationship</strong>. In a composite relationship, the existence or values of the origin feature controls or changes the existence or values of the destination feature or record. You saw this demonstrated when you changed the street name for the centerline and deleted the centerline, which caused changes to the street annotation layer.</p>

<p>You have seen the power of a relationship class in the previous recipe. You saw how linking two feature classes together allowed you to not only access information about the linked features but also control some behavior. However, this was all automatically set up by the Convert to Annotation tool. In many cases, the data you wish to link together already exists. So how do you create a relationship class which would link that existing data together?</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a relationship class between a feature class and a standalone table. This will be between the same parcel layer and sales table you related in the <em>Creating and using a Relate</em> recipe earlier in this chapter.  However, once you establish the relationship class, the link becomes permanent, unlike the relate which is limited to the map in which it was created.</p>

<li>Close both tables by clicking on the small X next to their name in the table view.</li>
<li>Click the Clear button located in the Selection group on the Map tab if you selected any records in either table.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now know that there is one parcel and two sales records which have a realkey value of 15812. This means you have a one to many cardinality. So, you know the key field and the cardinality you will need to create the relationship class which will link the Parcels layer to the Parcels_Sales table.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>In the Catalog pane, expand the Database folder so you can see the two databases which are connected to the project.</li>
<li>Expand the Thomaston.gdb geodatabase, then right-click on it and select Relationship. The Create Relationship tool should open in the Geoprocessing pane.</li>
<li>Set the Origin Table to Parcels using the drop-down arrow. This establishes the Parcels as the primary table for the relationship.</li>
<li>Set the Destination Table to Parcels_Sales using the drop-down arrow. This establishes it as the secondary or child table for the relationship.</li>
<li>The Output Relationship Class should be automatically populated with Parcels_Parcels_Sales. You can change the name if you desire, or accept the default.</li>
<li>Both the Forward Path Label and Backward Path Label should be automatically populated as well. Accept these default values.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="20">
<li>Set the Message Direction to None using the drop-down arrow, since we just want to be able to view related records between the tables. We are not trying to have one table control the information in the other.</li>
<li>Using the drop-down arrow, set the Cardinality to One to Many (1:M), since this was what you determined the cardinality to be previously.</li>
<li>Set the Origin Primary Key to Realkey and set the Origin Foreign Key to REALKEY.</li>
<li>Verify that your Create Relationship Class looks like the following image. If it does, click Run.</li>
</ol>

<p>Create Relationship Class window in Geoprocessing pane</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Once the tool has completed successfully, close the Geoprocessing pane.</li>
<li>In the Catalog pane, look at the contents of the Thomaston.gdb geodatabase. You should see the new relationship class you just created.</li>
<li>Right-click on the Relationship class in the Catalog pane and select Properties.</li>
<li>Take a moment to review the properties. They should reflect the settings you defined in the Create Relationship Class tool.</li>
<li>Click OK when done reviewing the properties.</li>
<li>Now to see if the new Relationship class you create works. Select the Parcels layer in the Contents pane.</li>
<li>Using the Explore tool, zoom into the center of the City of Thomaston. Zoom in so you can easily see the boundary of the individual parcels. This should be somewhere close to a scale of <kbd>1:4800</kbd>.</li>
<li>On the Map tab in the ribbon, activate the Select tool and click on a single parcel in the map. The selected parcel should have a blue highlighted boarder around it.</li>
<li>Click on the Data tab in the Feature Layer contextual menu in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Select the Related Data button and the Parcels_Parcels_Sales: Parcels option that is displayed. The Parcels_Sales table should open, displaying any sales associated with the parcel you selected. If no sales are displayed, try selecting another parcel.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>You will need to click on the Related Data button each time you select a new parcel to refresh the table view.</p>
</div>
<ol start="34">
<li>Once you have verified that the relationship class is working, close the table view.</li>
<li>Save your project and close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this recipe, you created a Relationship class which linked the Parcels feature class to the Parcels_Sales standalone table. This permanently linked these two objects in the geodatabase so that you were able to select a parcel in the map and easily see each time it had been sold from the Parcels_Sales table.</p>
<p>This link was established using a key field you identified in each table. The key field used by a Relationship class, like a Relate or a Join, must contain the same exact values and be the same field type (text, long integer, short integer, and others). However, the field names are not required to be the same. ArcGIS Pro is then able to find records in both tables that have the same value and link those together, as you saw demonstrated in this recipe.</p>
<p>Unlike a Join or a Relate, a relationship class is part of your geodatabase. This means that anytime you add the Parcels feature class to a map in any project, you will have access to the data in the Parcels_Sales table automatically through the Related Data function.</p>
<p>Once you create a relationship class, you are not able to change how it is configured. If you wanted to change a simple relationship to a composite for example, you would have to create a completely new relationship class.</p>
