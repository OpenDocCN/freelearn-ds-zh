- en: Now that you have successfully installed ArcGIS Pro, it is time to begin examining
    the user interface and how it works. ArcGIS Pro is the first Esri desktop product
    to make use of a ribbon interface, and this has become commonplace in many current
    desktop applications, including **Microsoft Office**, **Adobe Creative Suite**,
    and **Autodesk**'s **AutoCAD**. The new ribbon makes accessing tools and functionality
    quicker and easier than the drop-down menu and toolbar interface used by the older
    ArcMap and ArcCatalog applications that ArcGIS Pro is replacing.

    hear fellow GIS users using terms such as **topology**, **shapefiles**, **networks**,
    **geodatabase**, **feature class***,* and more. As your experience with **Geographic
    Information Systems** (**GIS**) grows, this new language will become second nature.
    You will find yourself using those words in conversations without realizing you
    are doing it. While you may completely understand what you are saying, non-GIS
    users may not. Consequently, the new ArcGIS Pro ribbon interface will require
    you to expand your GIS dictionary.

    while others are contextual, meaning they will change depending on tasks being
    performed. |'
  prefs: []

    Similar to Toolbars in ArcMap, tabs can be core or contextual. Core tabs are those
    that stay constant on the ribbon, such as **Project** and **Share**. Contextual
    tabs will change and appear depending on the tasks users are currently performing.
    Examples of Contextual tabs include **Map**, **Layout**, **Appearance**, and **Labeling**.

    Similar to the dockable windows in **ArcMap**, such as **Catalog**, **Search**,

    and closed, pinned in place, or set to auto-hide. |'

    a tab. An example of a Group on a tab is **Layer**, which is located on the Map
    tab and contains multiple tools for adding layers to a map. |'

    commands. The Quick Access Toolbar is typically located in the top left-hand corner
    of the ArcGIS Pro interface, although the position can be changed. This is similar
    to the Task Bar in Windows. |'

    be a 2D Map or a 3D Scene or a Layout, or some other visualization of your data.

    you can have multiple views and see them displayed at the same time. |'

    use ArcGIS Pro and navigate through its interface. As you start to use the interface,
    and if you used the older ArcMap application, I believe you will find it much
    more intuitive than the one used by ArcMap, which hides much of its functionality
    through a myriad of toolbars and menus.

    yourself how the new ribbon-style interface makes accessing tools and functionality
    quicker. The answer to this question is two-fold:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the new interface is smart. It will present you with the tools and information
    relevant to your current operation. For example, when working in a layout, tools
    associated with creating and printing a layout are presented. If you switch your
    focus by selecting a layer in a map, then a new series of options will be presented
    automatically that allows you to control and configure various layer properties,
    such as symbology and labeling.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, the new ribbon interface is similar to that found in many commonly used
    applications, such as those mentioned in the first paragraph. This greatly reduces
    the learning curve and make users feel much more comfortable when working with
    ArcGIS Pro.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This automatic behavior in the ribbon is referred to as **Contextual****Menus**
    or **Tabs**. The smart ribbon presents you with the tools when you need them.
    As you move on to other items or tasks, the ribbon automatically updates accordingly.
  prefs: []

    ArcGIS Pro interface. Starting at the top left-hand side, you will find the Quick
    Access Toolbar. This contains buttons that allow you to open an existing project,
    create a new project, save your project, undo, and redo. Located below that is
    the ribbon. This is where you access much of the ArcGIS Pro functionality through
    the various tabs. Below that you will find different panes and views. These will
    change depending on what your project contains and what you have open. The first
    time you open ArcGIS Pro, you will see the Contents pane on the left-hand side,
    the main view in the middle and the Catalog pane on the right-hand side.

    of applications, including **Microsoft Word**, **Excel**, and **PowerPoint**,
    along with **AutoCAD** and **Photoshop**, as we have mentioned before. As a result,
    users have grown comfortable with the look of these ribbon interfaces and how
    they perform. However, Esri has been slow to adopt this type of interface in its
    desktop GIS applications until ArcGIS Pro.
  prefs: []

    ribbon interface. This new interface is much more user-friendly than the older
    toolbar-style interface found in their older ArcMap and ArcCatalog applications.
    As you will see, it is smart. It will make tools available based on what you have
    selected, and it will keep them active within the application. This means that
    you do not need to search to find the functionality you are looking for.

    not see in a 2D view. Any layer can be visualized in 3D. This capability is not
    limited to just layers dealing with infrastructure. You will learn more about
