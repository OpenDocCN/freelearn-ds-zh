- en: In this chapter, we will finally learn how to debug and profile our GPU code
    using several different methods and tools. While we can easily debug pure Python
    code using IDEs such as Spyder and PyCharm, we can't use these tools to debug
    the actual GPU code, remembering that the GPU code itself is written in CUDA-C
    with PyCUDA providing an interface. The first and easiest method for debugging
    a CUDA kernel is the usage of `printf` statements, which we can actually call
    directly in the middle of a CUDA kernel to print to the standard output. We will
    see how to use `printf` in the context of CUDA and how to apply it effectively
    for debugging.

    can directly write CUDA programs within the NVIDIA Nsight IDE, which will allow
    us to make test cases in CUDA-C for some of the code we have been writing. We
    will take a look at how to compile CUDA-C programs, both from the command line
    with `nvcc` and also with the Nsight IDE. We will then see how to debug within
    Nsight and use Nsight to understand the CUDA lockstep property. Finally, we will
    have an overview of the NVIDIA command line and Visual Profilers for profiling
    our code.

    from directly within a CUDA kernel; not only that, each individual thread can
    print its own output. This will come in particularly handy when we are debugging
    our kernels, as we may need to monitor the values of particular variables or computations
    at particular points in our code and it will also free us from the shackles of
    using a debugger to go through step by step. Printing output from a CUDA kernel
    is done with none other than the most fundamental function in all of C/C++ programming,
    the function that most people will learn when they write their first `Hello world`
    program in C: `printf`. Of course, `printf` is the standard function that prints
    a string to the standard output, and is really the equivalent in the C programming
    language of Python''s `print` function.'

    CUDA. The first thing to remember is that `printf` always takes a string as its
    first parameter; so printing "Hello world!" in C is done with `printf("Hello world!\n");`.
    (Of course, `\n` indicates "new line" or "return", which moves the output in the
    Terminal to the next line.) `printf` can also take a variable number of parameters
    in the case that we want to print any constants or variables from directly within
    C: if we want to print the `123` integers to the output, we do this with `printf("%d",
    123);` (where `%d` indicates that an integer follows the string.)'

    `%f` is the decimal notation, `%e` is the scientific notation, and `%g` is the
    shortest representation whether decimal or scientific). We can even print several
    values in a row, remembering to place these specifiers in the correct order: `printf("%d
    is a prime number, %f is close to pi, and %d is even.\n", 17, 3.14, 4);` will

    CUDA architecture is a unit of 32 "lanes" within which our GPU executes kernels
    and grids over, where each lane will execute a single thread. A major limitation
    of warps is that all threads executing on a single warp must step through the
    same exact code in **lockstep**; this means that not every thread does indeed
    run the same code, but just ignores steps that are not applicable to it. (This
    is called lockstep because it's like a group of soldiers marching *lockstep* in
    unison—whether they want to march, or not!)

    from all 31 other threads in a single `if` statement, all 31 other threads have
    their execution delayed until this single anomalous thread finishes and returns
    from its solitary `if` divergence. This is a property that you should always keep
    in mind when writing kernels, and why branch divergence should be minimized as
    much as possible as a general rule in CUDA programming.
