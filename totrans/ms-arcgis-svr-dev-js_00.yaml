- en: In this digital age, we expect maps to be available wherever we are. We search
    for driving directions on our phone. We look for business locations and nearby
    restaurants using apps. Maintenance personnel use digital maps to locate assets
    several feet underground. Government officials and C-level executives need up-to-date
    location data to make important decisions that affect many lives.

- en: ESRI has been an industry leader for 30 years in the realm of digital mapping.
    Through products such as ArcGIS Server, they empower companies, government agencies,
    and digital cartographers to publish maps and geographic data on the Web. Websites
    and applications written with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript make those maps available
    on both desktop and mobile browsers. The API also provides the building blocks
    needed to create powerful applications for data presentation, collection, and
    analysis.

- en: While there are plenty of examples, blog posts, and books to get you started
    in developing apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, they don't often go that
    deep. They don't discuss the pitfalls, limitations, and best practices for developing
    applications with their tools. That next step is what this book tries to accomplish.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For all the chapters in the book, you will need a modern browser and a text
    editor to create files. Whichever text editor you choose is up to you, though
    one with syntax highlighting and some sort of JavaScript lining would help. For
    exercises in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Editing Map Data"), *Editing Map
    Data* and [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Mobile Development"), *Mobile Development*,
    you will also need access to a web hosting server to test files written in Java,
    PHP, or .NET. Finally, for the exercise in [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Testing"),
    *Testing*, you will need an up-to-date version of Node.js installed locally on
    your machine.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for web developers with some experience with ArcGIS Server, or
    geospatial professionals with some experience writing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
    This book assumes that you have viewed some of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript examples
    provided by ESRI. More importantly, this book is for someone who wishes to dive
    deeper into application development using ArcGIS Server. Other books provided
    by Packt Publishing, such as *Building Web and Mobile ArcGIS Server Applications
    with JavaScript* by Eric Pimpler or *Building Web Applications with ArcGIS* by
    Hussein Nasser, may be more suitable for an introduction to ArcGIS Server and
    the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
