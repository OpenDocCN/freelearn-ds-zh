    where we will download and open various types of GIS data. We will talk about
    the different types of data and we will work predominately with the GeoPackage
    format. We will mention the GeoTIFF (raster) and Shapefile (vector) formats as
    well. We will use existing data to interact with the canvas via zoom/pan/selection.
    Finally, we will talk about saving a project and look at projections.'
