			<p><a href="B19142_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Pivot Tables and Summary Tables</em>, explores the world of pivot tables in Excel using R and Python. Learn how to create and manipulate pivot tables directly from R/Python for seamless interaction with Excel.</p>
			<p><a href="B19142_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploratory Data Analysis with R and Python</em>, explains how to pull data in from Excel and perform <code>{skimr}</code> for R and <code>pandas</code> and <code>ppscore</code> for Python.</p>
			<p><a href="B19142_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Statistical Analysis: Linear and Logistic Regression</em>, teaches you how to perform simple statistical analysis with linear and logistic regression in R and Python on Excel data.</p>
			<p><a href="B19142_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor194"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Time Series Analysis: Statistics, Plots, and Forecasting</em>, explains how to perform simple time series analysis using the <code>forecast</code> package in R, and <code>kats</code> and <strong class="bold">long short-term memory</strong> (<strong class="bold">LSTM</strong>) in Python.</p>
			<p><a href="B19142_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor215"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Calling R/Python Locally from Excel Directly or via an API</em>, calls R and Python from Excel locally and via an API. This chapter also covers the open source tools for calling a local R/Python installation from Excel using BERT and <code>xlwings</code>, as well as open source and commercial API solutions.</p>
			<p><a href="B19142_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor238"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Data Analysis and Visualization with R and Python in Excel – A Case Study</em>, presents a case study of performing data visualization and machine learning in Excel by calling R or Python.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Before diving into this book, it’s helpful to have an intermediate understanding of either R or Python (or both), including intermediate-level proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and the tidyverse. Familiarity with Excel basics, such as navigating spreadsheets and performing simple data manipulations, is also assumed. Additionally, a basic understanding of statistical concepts and data visualization techniques will be beneficial for following along with the examples and exercises presented throughout the book.</p>
