            <article>
                
<p>Since its beginnings over 50 years ago, GIS has relied on 2D maps. They were what we created and where we performed all our analyses. Recently, this is changing. More and more, we are having to take the third dimension, Z, into account. This is because the world is becoming more crowded. Our infrastructure is stacking up upon itself, both above ground and below. So, the need to track and view data in 3D is increasing. Supporting technologies, such as <strong>Light Detection and Ranging</strong> (<strong>LiDAR</strong>), <strong>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</strong> (<strong>Drones/UAS/UAV</strong>), and increasing computer power are also adding to this push. </p>
<p>As you have seen if you have completed previous recipes in this book, ArcGIS Pro is a very powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing data. However, up to this point, we have been working in a 2D environment. While we can do a lot in 2D, it does have limitations because we live in a 3D world. ArcGIS Pro brings new 3D capabilities to the table that we have not had in previous desktop GIS applications. It natively supports the 3D viewing, querying, and limited analysis of data. When you add the 3D Analyst extension, then you open up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>
<p>Working in 3D provides much better ways to view and manage our infrastructure. We can begin to see the true spatial relationships between the features we are maintaining, viewing, and analyzing. ArcGIS Pro allows you to create 3D Maps, called <strong>Scenes</strong>, using the core application, as illustrated here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-948 image-border" height="603" src="assets/aa527a58-7554-4525-92dd-0b1eca5da934.png" width="1000"/></div>
<p>The preceding scene was created using ArcGIS Pro. You can see the buildings, power poles, light poles, and fire hydrants, all depicted in 3D. This allows you to see things such as whether a building will be in the way of a power line or whether a building will cast a shadow over an area that might prevent certain species of plants from growing. If you add the 3D Analyst extension, then you can begin to calculate the slope of road or pipe, determine whether one building might block the view from another, and more.</p>
<p>Don’t limit your 3D thinking or displays to infrastructure. Any data can be displayed in 3D. This opens up a whole new way to look at your data, as illustrated in the following maps:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949 image-border" height="407" src="assets/080aea89-33fd-40d8-b1fa-f0f8b4bbae33.png" width="1193"/></div>
<p>As you can see, these two maps have nothing to do with infrastructure. Instead they are highlighting areas with higher and lower values. The use of 3D makes those areas with higher and lower values stand out visually even more so than using traditional symbology. These maps also illustrate that you can combine traditional categorical and quantitative symbology with 3D to produce even more impactful maps. This capability is included in the core functionality of ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p><em>What if I need to do more than visualize data in 3D? What if I need to analyze the data so that I can make use of elevational or height information?</em> Well, we have already hinted at that. Esri has an extension for ArcGIS Pro called <strong>3D Analyst</strong>. This extension greatly enhances ArcGIS Pro’s ability to work within 3D. The 3D Analyst extension adds a new toolbox to your arsenal that contains 11 toolsets and over 100 tools for creating, converting, and analyzing 3D data. The 3D Analyst extension is not part of the core ArcGIS Pro product. It must be purchased as an additional license. However, it will work with all license levels of ArcGIS Pro. To learn more about the 3D Analyst extension, go to <a href="https://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/3danalyst">https://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/3danalyst</a>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will get an opportunity to explore some of the 3D capabilities of ArcGIS Pro. You will start by creating a 3D scene. Then you will learn how you can enable your features classes to store Z coordinates like it does <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. Then you will move on to more advanced concepts and begin to make use of the 3D Analyst extension.</p>

<p>As we said, ArcGIS Pro allows you to create 3D maps as part of its core functionality regardless of license level. So that is what you are about to do. In this scenario, you are working for an engineering firm that is working on a project to possibly turn a quarry into a water reservoir. The lead engineer on the project has asked you to create a 3D map of the area that he will use during a presentation to the client. This will help the client and engineer visualize the area as he creates his plan.</p>
<p>In ArcGIS Pro, a 3D map is called a <strong>scene</strong>. When creating a new 3D scene, one of the first things you need to determine is what data will serve as the ground surface. The ground surface becomes the canvas that all 2D layers are draped across. Yes, a 3D scene will include both 2D and 3D layers. Typical 2D layers might include an aerial photo, parcels, political boundaries, and natural water features. These often help put your 3D layers into context. The ground surface can also serve as the starting point for displaying the 3D layers. It may provide the starting elevation for those features. They are then extruded above or below that surface. Esri provides a terrain model that is the default ground surface for any new 3D scene. This model is a web service published through ArcGIS Online. You can also use your own elevation or terrain data. This can include a Digital Elevation Model (<strong>DEM</strong>), <strong>Triangulated Irregular Network</strong> (<strong>TIN</strong>), or other web services.  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a simple 3D scene of the project area. This scene will include both 2D and 3D layers. You set the elevation source for the map that will serve as the ground surface. You will start all this by creating a new project that contains a local scene. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>This recipe requires the sample data to be installed on the computer. It is recommended that you complete the recipes from <a href="45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology</em> before starting this recipe. This will ensure you have a better foundational understanding of how to add layers, set symbology, and navigate within a map. You can complete this recipe with any ArcGIS Pro licensing level.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you verify your computer hardware is sufficient for working with 3D data. This requires more power than working with traditional 2D Maps. It is recommended that you have at least an i5 or better processor with 8 GB or more RAM (16 GB if you don’t have a dedicated video card), dedicated video card with <strong>Graphics Processing Unit</strong> (<strong>GPU</strong>), and both 4 GB video RAM and 12 GB of free hard drive space. If you computer does not meet or exceed these specifications, you may have issues completing this and other recipes in this chapter.</p>

<ol>
<li>You will start by launching ArcGIS Pro as you have done in previous recipes. In the <span class="packt_screen">Create a new project</span> panel located on the right side, select <kbd>Local_Scene.aptx</kbd>, as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-950 image-border" height="424" src="assets/c4e3d84e-af88-48a8-bab3-48e5cde952f6.png" width="965"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Create a New Project</span> window that appears, name your new project <kbd>3DAnalyst</kbd>.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Browse</span> button at the end of the <span class="packt_screen">Location</span> cell. Then in the left panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Select a folder to store the project</span> window, click <span class="packt_screen">Computer</span>.</li>
<li>In the panel on the right, double-click the <kbd>C:</kbd> drive. It is sometimes labeled as OS or local drive.</li>
<li>Scroll down and double-click the <kbd>Student</kbd> folder. Then repeat for the <kbd>ArcGISProCookbook</kbd> folder.</li>
<li>Scroll down and select the <kbd>Chapter 10</kbd> folder. Do not double-click it. Once selected so that <kbd>Chapter10</kbd> appears as the <span class="packt_screen">Name</span>, click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Remember, for this part of creating a new project, you are selecting the location where the new project will be stored, not what the project is being named. So you must select an existing folder on a local drive or network share. If you double-click instead of single-clicking to select, you will need to back up one folder. You can do that simply by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Back</span> button located in the left corner. It looks like an arrow inside a circle.</p>
</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Verify your <span class="packt_screen">Create a New Project</span> window looks like the following and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-951 image-border" height="517" src="assets/55c846df-0465-42fc-8950-b6a77f6f9781.png" width="1178"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have just created a new project. This new project contains a single local scene. Now you will need to add data and folder connections to the project that you will need in order to add layers and access data.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Folders</span> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">Add Folder Connection</span>.</li>
<li>In the panel on the left of the <span class="packt_screen">Add Folder Connection</span> window, select <span class="packt_screen">Computer</span>. Then double-click the <span class="packt_screen">C:</span> drive.</li>
<li>Scroll down and double-click the <span class="packt_screen">Student</span> folder.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">ArcGISProCookbook</span> folder with a single click and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Folders</span> <span>folder in the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> <span>pane and answer the following question.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What folders do you see connected to your project?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: </p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should see that two folders are now connected. The first is your project folder. This has the same name as the project you just created. The second folder is the connection you just added. If you were to expand the <span class="packt_screen">ArcGISProCookbook</span> folder connection, you will see all the other folders inside. Adding the connection to that folder allows you to access and use data contained in any of those folders inside this project. Now you will connect to a couple of databases that you will need in this and future recipes.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> folder in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane and select <span class="packt_screen">Add Database</span>.</li>
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">Folders</span> located under <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> in the left panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Select Existing Geodatabase</span> window. You may need to expand the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> folder to see it.</li>
<li>Double-click the <span class="packt_screen">ArcGISProCookbook</span> folder.</li>
<li>Scroll down and double-click the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> folder.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">AthensQuarry.gdb</span> and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have just added the connection to the primary database you will be using in this recipe. But since you will be using this project for other recipes in this chapter, you will go ahead and connect to the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS.gdb</span> geodatabase that you will need later.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Repeat that same process to add the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS.gdb</span> geodatabase to the project. The one difference being that you need to select the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS.gdb</span> at the end before you click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Local_Scene.gdb</span> database and click <span class="packt_screen">Remove</span>. You will not be using that database, so removing it cleans up the project.</li>
<li>Save your project.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">So, you have added the databases and folder connections that you need to the project. Now you are ready to begin configuring your 3D scene. You will need to first configure some properties for the scene.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, right-click <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab, rename the scene to <kbd>Quarry Project</kbd>.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Display units</span> to <span class="packt_screen">US Feet</span> using the drop-down arrow. This project is located in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Elevation Units</span> to the same value.</li>
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">Elevation Surface</span> in the left panel of the window.</li>
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Elevation sources</span> option located near the bottom of the window. You should see the <span class="packt_screen">WorldElevation3D/Terrain3D</span> web service listed. This is the default surface used for new scenes.</li>
<li>Add your own local <span class="packt_screen">Elevation source</span> that is more accurate than the one provided by Esri. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Elevation Source</span> button.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> folder under <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> in the left panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Add Elevation Source</span> window.</li>
<li>Double-click the <span class="packt_screen">AthensQuarry.gdb</span> geodatabase in the right panel.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">quarry_dem</span> and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>. This is a digital elevation model that was created by a surveyor in the firm you are working at for this project. It is based on actual field survey data for the project site.<br/>
You should now have two <span class="packt_screen">Elevation sources</span> <span>listed for this project. You may also see a warning telling you a</span> datum transformation <span>was applied. This is normal because your DEM and the Esri web service make use of two different coordinate systems and</span> datums<span>.  You can click the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Transformation</span> <span>page in the properties if you want to learn more.<br/></span>It is not unusual for a scene to have more than one <span class="packt_screen">Elevation source</span><span>. It depends on the area covered by both the project and local elevation sources. ArcGIS Pro treats overlapping elevation sources much like layers in the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> <span>pane. It will use the top one that covers the area in question if two or more of the sources overlap. In this case, it will use the local DEM you just added until you reach the spatial edge where the DEM ends. Then it will make use of the Esri Terrain Model as the source.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="31">
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">Coordinate System</span> in the left panel. The engineer wants everything in the local state plane coordinate system since that is what the survey data was collected in.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="32">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Coordinate System</span> button and select <span class="packt_screen">Import Coordinate System</span> as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952 image-border" height="535" src="assets/47ca4b86-cb73-4f8e-ad36-ff90aa1e7eb9.png" width="1047"/></div>
<ol start="33">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Import Coordinate System</span>, select <span class="packt_screen">quarry_DEM</span> from the right panel. If you do not see it, you will need to navigate to the <span class="packt_screen">AthensQuarry.gdb</span> geodatabase located in the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> project folder. Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> once you select <span class="packt_screen">quarry_DEM</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="34">
<li>You may get a warning about the imported coordinate system. If you do, ignore it. You should now have both a <span class="packt_screen">Current XY</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Current Z</span> coordinate system assigned, as illustrated in the following graphic. Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> if you do to apply these changes to the scene's properties:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-953 image-border" height="284" src="assets/e2576e1f-f009-46cf-9659-3f0ea0947033.png" width="454"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your scene will change in such a way that the earth will appear to be oblong in shape. This is because you have assigned a local coordinate system to your map that is designed to preserve the data as much as possible in the project area. Now you will add layers to the scene.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Save your project.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Data</span> button on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Layer group</span>.</li>
<li>Double-click the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> folder and then the <span class="packt_screen">AthensQuarry.gdb</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="38">
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Bldg</span>, <span class="packt_screen">HydroLine</span>, <span class="packt_screen">HydroPoly</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> feature classes. Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> once you have the feature classes selected.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Holding down your <em>Ctrl</em> key while selecting will allow you to select multiple feature classes.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The new layers you added should appear in your map as 2D Layers. You will need to adjust the draw order for the layers and the symbology.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, select and drag the <span class="packt_screen">Lakes</span> layer so it is above the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span>.</li>
<li>Select and drag the <span class="packt_screen">Bldg</span> layer so it is above the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer as well. It can be either above or below the <span class="packt_screen">Lakes</span> layer.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">All layers should now be visible in your map. No layer should be hiding behind another one. Now, let's work on the symbology.</p>
<ol start="41">
<li>Click the symbol patch located below the <span class="packt_screen">Streams</span> layer name. This should open the Symbology pane.</li>
<li>Ensure you are viewing the <span class="packt_screen">Gallery</span> by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Gallery</span> tab next the top of the pane. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Water</span> (line) predefined symbol.</li>
<li>Click the symbol patch located below the <span class="packt_screen">Lakes</span> layer name. Then select the <span class="packt_screen">Water</span> (area) predefined symbol on the <span class="packt_screen">Symbology</span> pane.</li>
<li>Click the symbol patch below the <span class="packt_screen">Bldg</span> layer name. Then select the <span class="packt_screen">Building Footprint</span> predefined symbol. If you see more than one, select any one you want to use.</li>
<li>Click the symbol patch located below the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer name. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Black Outline</span> predefined symbol.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="46">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Symbology</span> pane.<br/>
Your <span>scene should now look like the following graphic. So far, you have created a new project that contains a 3D scene. You then configured the source elevation, which is the ground surface for the scene, using a local digital elevation model. Lastly, you added several layers to the scene. These layers are all being displayed as 2D layers, which means they are just being draped across the DEM you specified as the elevation</span> source<span>:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954 image-border" height="380" src="assets/157b5c3a-4be1-4450-bd6e-7898caa36d63.png" width="732"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now it's time to make one of the 2D layers a 3D layer. This is fairly easy to do.</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Bldg</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane.</li>
<li>Drag and drop it on the 3D Layers in the list. The 3D Layers will highlight in blue when your mouse pointer is on top of it. This is the indication to release your mouse button. The <span class="packt_screen">Bldg</span> layer should now appear under <span class="packt_screen">3D Layers</span> indicating it is now a 3D layer. This means you will be able to display the buildings as 3D objects in the scene.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="49">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Extrusion</span> group, click the drop-down arrow located below <span class="packt_screen">Type</span>. Select <span class="packt_screen">Min Height</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have just extruded the building in the <span class="packt_screen">Bldg</span> layer based on a field in the attribute table that has each building's estimated height. Let’s look at the results of your work so you can see the buildings are indeed 3D.</p>
<ol start="51">
<li>Place your mouse pointer on the southern side of the scene; anywhere on the southern side will work.</li>
<li>Press the scroll wheel located in the center of your mouse. While holding it down, push the mouse away from you. This should rotate the scene around the <em>z</em> axis. Rotate it until you can begin to see the building heights above the ground and 2D layers. Then release your scroll wheel.</li>
<li>Roll your scroll wheel so that you zoom in closer, so you can see the buildings and verify they are being shown above the ground and 2D layers.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your scene should look similar to the following screenshot. Yours might be a little different depending on how far you rotated the scene along the Z axis and how much you zoomed in:</p>

<p>You have just created a very basic 3D Scene using the core functionality found in ArcGIS Pro. What you just did can be accomplished at all license levels of ArcGIS Pro and does not require any extensions. If you want to learn more about creating 3D Scenes in ArcGIS Pro, you may want to examine <em>Chapter 5</em>, <em>Creating 3D Maps</em>, in <em>Learning ArcGIS Pro</em> by Tripp Corbin, GISP from Packt Publishing and watch the author's YouTube video on creating 3D maps with ArcGIS  Pro: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRWE-CXO58s&amp;t=58s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRWE-CXO58s&amp;t=58s</a>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In <a href="b6f25e84-28a9-4d2d-aaca-3550460d4650.xhtml">C</a>hapter 2, <em>Creating and storing data</em>, we learned that vector data, points, lines, and polygons store data using the X and Y coordinates for the features. This determines their location, which is then displayed in a map. We expanded on that in <a href="9a0a5ec0-c176-44bf-a5d0-fdffb73c78a5.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Projections and Coordinate System Basics</em>, where we learned those X and Y coordinates were referencing locations in a specific, real-world coordinate system that ties our data to the Earth. This allowed us to bring data from all over into our maps, so we could see their spatial relationships. ArcGIS Pro will project data that is in different coordinate systems on the fly, so they are displayed together.  However, that only represents two dimensions.</p>
<p>Can you enable data in <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro</span> to store Z, the third dimension? Of course you can. You typically do this when you first create the feature class or shapefile. Some formats, such as an AutoCAD DWG and DXF file, are always Z-enabled. The 3D Analyst extension for ArcGIS Pro also has tools that allow you to convert existing 2D data to 3D Z-enabled data.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will continue to work with the data for the quarry project you used in the last recipe. The engineer is now concerned about the nearby airport. He needs to see the runways in relation to the quarry and may need to make calculations concerning runoff from the quarry to those runways. He has acquired a shapefile that contains the location of runways, taxi ranks, and parking areas at the airport. However, they are not Z-enabled. You will create a new feature class in the <kbd>Athens_Quarry</kbd> geodatabase that is Z-enabled. Then, you will import the data from the shapefile into it. Lastly, you will calculate the elevation of the features based on the <span class="packt_screen">Digital Elevation Model</span> you selected as the ground elevation in the previous recipe.</p>

<p>This recipe requires the sample data to be installed on the computer. You will need to have completed the previous recipe before starting this one. You will also need to have the 3D Analyst extension to complete this recipe.</p>
<p>To determine whether you have access to the 3D Analyst extension, open ArcGIS Pro. Then, open any project you have previously opened. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> tab in the ribbon. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Licensing</span> option in the left panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> pane. This will tell you what license level and extensions you currently have access to, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-957 image-border" height="536" src="assets/ab5e6509-9ad3-4d23-9f37-0181fa2c4c76.png" width="1093"/></div>
<p>If you do not have access to the 3D Analyst extension, first contact your administrator to see whether they can provide one for you. If you do not have a license for this extension, you can request a trial license from Esri at <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial">https://www.esri.com/arcgis/trial</a>.</p>
<p>This recipe can be completed with any license level of ArcGIS Pro, as long as you have the 3D Analyst extension.   </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating multipatch features from 2D</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In working through the recipes in this chapter, you have learned how to display 2D data in 3D and how to create basic Z-enabled layers. All of these methods for working in 3D open the door to a wealth of capabilities within ArcGIS Pro from display to analysis. However, they all still have limitations. Extruding 2D data to display in 3D does allow us to see those features and their relationships in three dimensions compared to other features, but we are not able to easily calculate volumes or locate a position vertically within the extruded feature. Adding Z coordinates to a point, line, or polygon allows us to place it in the correct space but again they still only form a single plane. What do we need to create a solid shape (meaning something that has volume)? There is a more advanced 3D data format that is supported in ArcGIS Pro that allows for this. It is called <strong>Multipatch</strong>.</p>
<p>Multipatch is a true 3D object. It is constructed using a series of planes or polygons that are drawn in a 3D environment. They are connected together to form a 3D feature.  The planes or polygons that form the feature are also called <strong>patches</strong>. Thus, the term multipatch. ArcGIS Pro is not the only application that allows for the display and creation of Multipatch features. Most <strong>computer-aided drafting and design</strong> (<strong>CADD</strong>) software also can be used to create multipatch features.  Because of the complexity of a multipatch feature, you are often able to show more detail than what you can accomplish with simple extrusion. Multipatch feature classes also increase the number of analysis tools you can use from the 3D Analyst extension for calculating line of sight and more.  </p>
<p>The City Planner for the City of Trippville wants to incorporate line of sight requirements into the development regulations for the City. He will want to see whether new buildings will adversely impact the views of existing buildings to key elements, such as parks and rivers, in the City. Many of these types of calculations require the use of multipatch features. In this recipe, you will convert the building footprints from extruded buildings to a new multipatch feature class.   </p>

<li>Start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>3DAnalyst.aprx</kbd> project you used in the previous recipes in this chapter. This project should be included in your list of recently opened projects.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Maps</span> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">New Scene</span>.</li>
<li>A new scene should open in the view area. Unless you have changed the default options, the new scene will display in the <span class="packt_screen">Global</span> view. Since you are working with a single small city, you need to change it to a local view. Click the <span class="packt_screen">View</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Local</span> button located in the <span class="packt_screen">View</span> group. This will change your scene to be a local view, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>

<div class="packt_infobox"><span>Scenes will either be global or local. Global scenes are used for large area 3D maps where the curvature of the earth can impact the display and analysis of the data. Local scenes are for smaller areas such as a City, Township, or County. In these cases, the curvature of the earth has less impact due to the scale of the 3D map. Local scenes most often make use of a projected coordinate system, whereas Global uses a geographic.

<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Just a reminder, you should save your projects often because ArcGIS Pro does not have an autosave option for projects. Working with 3D scenes requires a lot more resources than 2D Maps. This makes them more prone to crashing and failure. To allow you to quickly recover if this happens, save your project any time you have made major changes to it, such as adding and configuring a new scene.</p>

<ol start="52">
<li>Close the attribute table for the <span class="packt_screen">Buildings_MP</span> layer.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">When you set the <span class="packt_screen">Buildings_MP</span> as the <span class="packt_screen">Input Features</span> for the <span class="packt_screen">Add Z Information</span> tool, you are presented with many output options. You can have the tool calculate the volume of each building, the total surface area, and more. When you set the <span class="packt_screen">Buildings</span> layer as the input, you are presented with no options. That is because that layer, though being displayed in 3D, is not a true 3D layer. So the tool will not work with it.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>If you want, you can run the <span class="packt_screen">Add Z Information</span> tool using the <span class="packt_screen">Buildings_MP</span> layer as the input and whatever options for the <span class="packt_screen">Output Property</span> you want just so you can see the results. If you do, close the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane when it is complete. If you do not want to try this step, simply close the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane. </li>

            <article>
                
<p>So far you have learned how to create 3D features from existing 2D features. The first method you learned was creating a new Z-enabled feature class and importing existing 2D features into it. Then, updating the Z coordinates based on a elevation surface. Next, you learned how to convert extruded features into a new multipatch feature class. So how do you create new 3D features from scratch?</p>
<p>Like most things in ArcGIS Pro, there are several methods you can use. You can create new 3D features in either a 2D map or a 3D scene. You can then specify a specific Z coordinate or have them automatically inherit the ground surface elevation.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a few new 3D features. These are based on requests from the Director of Planning for the City of Trippville. For the first, he wants to flesh out the 3D view of the City, so it includes fences. So, you will begin digitizing fences. You will start in a 2D map and then move to the 3D Scene. Next, the Director is concerned about the construction of a new proposed building. He believes it will block the view to one of the main parks in the City from an existing building. So, he needs you to establish a few observation points that you will use in a later recipe to establish sight lines and determine visibility.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you created several new 3D features. You created two new fence features. The new fences inherited the Z coordinate from the location you clicked using the ground surface as a reference. You then specified a height for each fence that was then used to extrude them, so they displayed at their true height above the ground. Then, you created a completely new Z-enabled feature class to store observation points that you will use in the following recipe to analyze the ability to see Washington Park from those locations. The Z coordinates for those new points were determined by the corner of the buildings you snapped to.</p>

<p>You've learned several ways to create new 3D features. Now it is time to investigate some analyses you can perform with these features that you cannot do with 2D. A common analysis is to determine lines of sight. This has many uses. It can be used by property appraisers to determine whether a property has a good line of sight to a key feature, such as a river or ocean, which might increase its value. It is used by police to establish security perimeters for special events. It might be used to help plan a parade route. So, as you can see, there are many uses for such an analysis.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will use the observation points you created in the previous recipe to determine whether there are lines of sight to Washington Park or whether the proposed building will block the view of the park entirely. This will be one of the determining factors the Planning Director will use to for deciding whether or not to approve the new building. This will require the use of several geoprocessing tools from the 3D Analyst extension for ArcGIS Pro.</p>

<p>Now you have performed your first 3D analysis to determine lines of sight from specified points to an existing feature. This required you to have the 3D Analyst extension for ArcGIS Pro. In addition, you had to create several 3D layers before you were able to perform this analysis. This included creating a multipatch layer representing the buildings in Trippville and observation points.</p>
<p>You could have performed this same analysis in a 2D Map. ArcGIS Pro can still perform 3D analysis in a 2D map. However, the results will not be as impactful or informative when displayed in a 2D map.</p>

<p>Another common 3D analysis task is to calculate the volume of the area covered by a polygon feature. This is done by overlaying the polygon feature across a surface and then calculating the volume that exists between the plane created by the polygon features and the surface they overlay.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will return to the quarry project you worked on earlier. The project engineer has determined the optimum full pool elevation and created a polygon layer for you. He wants you to determine what the total volume of water will be needed to fill the quarry to this level in gallons.</p>
<p>You will use the <span class="packt_screen">Polygon Volume</span> tool that is part of the 3D Analyst extension to accomplish part of this analysis. You will then use the <span class="packt_screen">Calculate Field</span> tool to calculate the total gallons required to fill the quarry.  </p>

<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Full Pool Level</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span>. You should see two fields that were added: <span class="packt_screen">Volume</span> and <span class="packt_screen">SArea</span>.<br/>
The volume is in cubic feet because your horizontal and vertical units for the layer are set to <span class="packt_screen">US Feet</span><span>. The engineer needs to know the volume in US gallons. You will now create a new field to contain the volume in gallons and use the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Calculate Field</span> <span>tool to populate it. </span></li>

<p>You have just calculated the volume for an area covered by a polygon. This required you to have two datasets. You needed an elevation surface. The <span class="packt_screen">Polygon Volume</span> tool you used required the surface to be in TIN, Terrain or LAS formats. The other dataset you needed was a polygon that formed the plane that was used to overlay the surface. </p>
