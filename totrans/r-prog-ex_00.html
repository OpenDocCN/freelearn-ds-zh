<p class="calibre2">In a world where data is becoming increasingly important, data analysts, scientists, and business people need tools to analyze and process large volumes of data efficiently. This book is my attempt to pass on what I've learned so far, so that you can quickly become an effective and efficient R programmer. Reading it will help you understand how to use R to solve complex problems, avoid some of the mistakes I've made, and teach you useful techniques that can be helpful in a variety of contexts. In the process, I hope to show you that, despite its uncommon aspects, R is an elegant and powerful language, and is well suited for data analysis and statistics, as well as complex systems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After reading this book, you will be familiar with R's fundamentals, as well as some of its advanced features. You will understand data structures, and you will know how to efficiently deal with them. You will also understand how to design complex systems that perform efficiently, and how to make these systems usable by other people through web applications. At a lower level, you will understand how to work with object-oriented programming, functional programming, and reactive programming, and what code may be better written in each of these paradigms. You will learn how to use various cutting edge tools that R provides to develop software, how to identify performance bottlenecks, and how to fix them, possibly using other programming languages such as Fortran and C++. Finally, you will be comfortable reading and understanding the majority of R code, as well as provide feedback for others' code.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0022.html#KVCC0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre19">Introduction to R</em>, covers the R basics you need to understand the rest of the examples. It is not meant to be a thorough introduction to R. Rather, it's meant to give you the very basic concepts and techniques you need to quickly get started with the three examples contained in the book, and which I introduce next.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This book uses three examples to showcase R's wide range of functionality. The first example shows how to analyze votes with descriptive statistics and linear models, and it is presented in <a href="part0059.html#1O8H60-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre19">Understanding Votes with Descriptive Statistics</em> and <a href="part0076.html#28FAO0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre19">Predicting Votes with Linear Models</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0059.html#1O8H60-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre19">Understanding Votes with Descriptive Statistics</em>, shows how to programatically create hundreds of graphs to identify relations within data visually. It shows how to create histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, and how to perform <strong class="calibre1">Principal Component Analysis</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">PCA</strong>).</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0076.html#28FAO0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre19">Predicting Votes with Linear Models</em>, shows how to programatically find the best predictive linear model for a set of data, and according to different success metrics. It also shows how to check model assumptions, and how to use cross validation to increase confidence in your results.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The second example shows how to simulate data, visualize it, analyze its text components, and create automatic presentations with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0091.html#2MP360-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre19">Simulating Sales Data and Working with Databases</em>, shows how to design data schema and simulate the various types of data. It also shows how to integrate real text data with simulated data, and how to use a SQL database to access it more efficiently.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0110.html#38STS0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre19">Communicating Sales with Visualization</em>, shows how to produce basic to advanced graphs, highly customized graphs. It also shows how to create dynamic 3D graphs and interactive maps.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0129.html#3R0OI0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre19">Understanding Reviews with Text Analysis</em>, shows how to perform text analysis step by step using <strong class="calibre1">Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">NLP</strong>) techniques, as well as sentiment analysis.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0147.html#4C62M0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre19">Developing Automatic Presentations</em>, shows how to put together the results of previous chapters to create presentations that can be automatically updated with the latest data using tools such as knitr and R Markdown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, the third example shows how to design and develop complex object-oriented systems that retrieve real-time data from cryptocurrency markets, as well as how to optimize implementations and how to build web applications around such systems.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0178.html#59O440-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 8</a>, <em class="calibre19">Object-Oriented System to Track Cryptocurrencies</em>, introduces basic object-oriented techniques that produce complex systems when combined. Furthermore, it shows how to work with three of R’s most used object models, which are S3, S4, and R6, as well as how to make them work together.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0229.html#6QCGQ0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>, <em class="calibre19">Implementing an Efficient Simple Moving Average</em>, shows how to iteratively improve an implementation for a <strong class="calibre1">Simple Moving Average</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">SMA</strong>), starting with what is considered to be bad code, all the way to advanced optimization techniques using parallelization, and delegation to the Fortran and C++ languages.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0271.html#82E8E0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre19">Adding Interactivity with Dashboards</em>, shows how to wrap what was built during the previous two chapters to produce a modern web application using reactive programming through the Shiny package.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0296.html#8Q96G0-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730" class="calibre4">Appendix</a>, <em class="calibre19">Required Packages</em>, shows how to install the internal and external software necessary to replicate the examples in the book. Specifically, it will walk through the installation processes for Linux and macOS, but Windows follows similar principles and should not cause any problems.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">This book was written in a Linux environment (specifically Ubuntu 17.10), and was also tested with a macOS, High Sierra. Even though it was not tested on a Windows computer, all of the R code presented in this book should work fine with one. The only substantial difference is that when I show you how to perform a task using a Terminal, it will be the bash terminal, which is available in Linux and macOS by default. In the case of Windows, you will need to use the cmd.exe terminal, for which you can find a lot of information online. Keep in mind that if you're using a Windows computer, you should be prepared to do a bit more research on your end to replicate the same functionality, but you should not have much trouble at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the appendix, I show you how to install the software you need to replicate the examples shown in this book. I show you how to do so for Linux and macOS, specifically Ubuntu 17.10 and High Sierra. If you're using Windows, the same principles apply but the specifics may be a bit different. However, I'm sure it will not be too hard in any case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two types of requirements you need to be able to execute all the code in this book: external and internal. Software outside of R is what I call external requirements. Software inside of R, meaning R packages, is what I refer to as internal requirements. I walk you through the installation of both of them in the appendix.</p>

<p class="calibre2">This book is for those who wish to develop software in R. You don't need to be an expert or professional programmer to follow this book, but you do need to be interested in learning how R works. My hope is that this book is useful for people ranging from beginners to advanced by providing hands-on examples that may help you understand R in ways you previously did not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I assume basic programming, mathematical, and statistical knowledge, because there are various parts in the book where concepts from these disciplines will be used, and they will not be explained in detail. If you have programmed something yourself in any programming language, know basic linear algebra and statistics, and know what linear regression is, you have everything you need to understand this book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This book was written for people in a variety of contexts and with diverse profiles. For example, if you are an analyst employed by an organization that requires you to do frequent data processing to produce reports on a regular basis, and you need to develop programs to automate such tasks, this book is for you. If you are an academic researcher who wants to use current techniques, combine them, and develop tools to test them automatically, this book is for you. If you're a professional programmer looking for ways to take advantage of advanced R features, this book is for you. Finally, if you're preparing for a future in which data will be of paramount importance (it already is), this book is for you.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>We can load the contents of the </span><kbd class="calibre9">data.csv</kbd><span> file into a data frame (the most intuitive structure to use with data in CSV format) by using the </span><kbd class="calibre9">read.csv()</kbd><span> function.</span>"</p>
<p class="calibre2">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">data &lt;- read.csv("./data_brexit_referendum.csv") <br class="title-page-name"/>data[data$Leave == -1, "Leave"] &lt;- NA </pre>
<p class="calibre2">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold: </p>
<pre class="mce-root">sum(is.na(data$Leave))<br class="title-page-name"/><strong class="calibre1">#&gt; [1] 267</strong></pre>
<p class="calibre2">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root"><strong class="calibre1">$ sudo service mysql start</strong></pre>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre1">New terms</strong> and <strong class="calibre1">important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "<span>Now that our code is ready, we should see a table appear in the </span><span>Data Overview</span><span> tab.</span>"</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
