    not just within an existing data source, but also across data sources. This chapter
    first describes the definitions and the differences between Aggregate and Non-Aggregate
    values. Then, you will learn about various types of calculations, such as numeric
    calculations, string calculations, and date calculations, as well as how to write
    logic statements in Tableau.

    or goals. It could be as simple as determining your most profitable customers,
    or more complicated, such as investigating which products are leading to losses
    despite high sales. After deciding on questions or goals, you would audit your
    data. This means identifying where data resides—whether the required fields are
    stored in a single or in multiple data sources and whether all fields are readily
    available for use. Then, you would check the integrity and validity of your data.
    This means checking whether the data needs any modifications in terms of cleaning,
    combining, or restructuring.

    for more streamlined analysis. This can mean building charts, adding interactivity,
    separating data into groups, or creating calculations to derive more meaningful
    insights. Once analysis is complete, the insights you gather will be ready to
    share with others. This chapter aims to cover all aspects of the data analysis
    cycle.

    of aggregation. When adding any data, Tableau quickly classifies the data in the
    `Data` pane as `Dimensions` and `Measures.` When a `Measure` enters the view,
    Tableau aggregates it (typically, using the `SUM` aggregation).

    in the view, it means that Tableau is aggregating all transactional values. When
    you see `Profit` only, it means that Tableau is taking notice of the transactional
    values without aggregating them. This particular distinction is important, especially

    string using dimensions and aggregated `Measures`. You saw how to typecast an
    integer of a float value into a string, and how to aggregate a dimension using
    either the `MIN`, `MAX`, or `ATTR` functions to get rid of the `Cannot mix aggregate
    and non-aggregate arguments…` error. Now you know how to manipulate string fields,
    it is time to explore date functions.

    Now, when you want to find the total value in each month, you add the values of
    product A and product B. However, since both of these fields have null values
    in certain months, the calculated field only shows the output for months with
    values in both columns. For months where either of the values are missing, the

    null values without getting a null output.

    Keep these links as is, then double-click the `Budget Sales` field from the `Measures`

- en: As a data analyst, you may encounter a scenario where you are required to compute
    profit margins using the `Profit and Sales` field and filter this `Profit Margin`
    below a certain threshold. The aim of this activity is to calculate the `Profit
    Margin`, which is computed by dividing `Profit` by `Sales`. Once you have the
    `Profit Margin` computed, you want to filter products and only display the `Profit
    Margin` for the `Xerox` product. Finally, you want to filter the `Xerox` products,
    and only look at those where the `Profit Margin` is more than 45%.

- en: In this chapter, you explored some important aspects involved in creating and
    using calculations in Tableau and studied the difference between aggregate and
    non-aggregate fields. You looked at numeric, string, and date calculations, and
    learned to write logic statements and handle null values. Finally, you looked
    at how to use these calculations across data sources.
