- en: One of the key functions of a **Geographic Information System** (**GIS**) is
    to visualize data. In a GIS, we use maps as our primary method for visualizing
    data. Maps allow us to see and analyze the spatial relationships between features
    in one or more layers. We create maps for many different reasons. Often, we are
    trying to show the location of specific assets or to highlight attributes associated
    with features, such as a parcel's zoning classification or a pipe size. Sometimes
    we wish to show the results of the analysis we have performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, each map we create in ArcGIS Pro has a reason for existing. This purpose
    will help to dictate what layers we include in the map and how they are visualized.
    There is no limit to the number of layers a map can contain. However, it is possible
    to have so many layers in a map that it distracts from the purpose. As the author
    of the map, you must strike a balance between the amount of information you include
    in a map and its overall purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each layer in a map has a set of properties. This includes things such as the
    source, symbology, visibility ranges, coordinate system and more. When you create
    a map and add layers, you must configure many of these settings manually to ensure
    your map is legible and supports its intended purpose.

    As you will learn later, creating a new project using a template can automatically
    create a new map that you can build on. Of course, you can also add new maps to
    existing projects as needed. ArcGIS Pro supports several methods for creating
    or adding maps to existing projects. Which method is best will depend on several
    factors, including personal preference. It also depends on whether the map already
    exists in another project or the current one, or if it is a map document file
    from the old ArcMap application ArcGIS Pro is replacing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to remember is that an ArcGIS Pro project can contain multiple
    maps. It is not uncommon for a single ArcGIS Pro project to contain multiple maps
    required to support daily operations. For example, if you are the GIS manager
    for a city, you might have most maps in a single project, such as zoning, land
    use, voting districts, police zones, tax districts, and more. That might make
    it easier to manage your GIS files and maps.

- en: A map only provides a canvas for displaying your data to support its purpose.
    You must add and configure the content. This normally means adding layers that
    represent the features you wish to display within your map. Just as there are
    multiple methods for creating new maps, there is also more than one way to add
    new layers to a map.

    may need to have multiple maps in your projects to support the various needs of
    your organization or clients. Each map you create should have a specific purpose.
    The purpose will help you determine what layers you will need, and which need
    to be the primary focus.

    maps to it. You were introduced to several methods to add new maps to your project
    including using a project template, adding a blank map, and using a pre-configured
    map file. Once you created the maps, you then used various methods to add new
    layers.

    Without maps, you are not able to make use of some of the more advanced capabilities
    of ArcGIS Pro such as performing data edits, analyzing data, and sharing your
    data with others either via printed maps or digital formats. All of these capabilities
    start with a map.

    how to create 3D maps that allow you to view data in a more realistic-looking
    environment. The ability to view data in 3D is an enhancement ArcGIS Pro provides
    over Esri's older desktop software, which did not allow users to view data in
    3D natively.
