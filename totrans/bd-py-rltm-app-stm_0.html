  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Apache Storm is a powerful framework for creating complex workflows that ingest and process huge amounts of data. With its generic concepts of spouts and bolts, along with simple deployment and monitoring tools, it allows developers to focus on the specifics of their workflow without reinventing the wheel.</p><p>However, Storm is written in Java. While it supports other programming languages besides Java, the tools are incomplete and there is little documentation and few examples.</p><p>One of the authors of this book created Petrel, the first framework that supports the creation of Storm topologies in 100 percent Python. He has firsthand experience with the struggles of building a Python Storm topology on the Java tool set. This book closes this gap, providing a resource to help Python developers of all experience levels in building their own applications using Storm.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Acquainted with Storm">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Acquainted with Storm</em>, provides detailed information about Storm's use cases, different installation modes, and configuration in Storm.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. The Storm Anatomy">Chapter 2</a>, <em>The Storm Anatomy</em>, tells you about Storm-specific terminologies, processes, fault tolerance in Storm, tuning parallelism in Storm, and guaranteed tuple processing, with detailed explanations about each of these.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Introducing Petrel">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Introducing Petrel</em>, introduces a framework called Petrel for building Storm topologies in Python. This chapter walks through the installation of Petrel and includes a simple example.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Example Topology – Twitter">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Example Topology – Twitter</em>, provides an in-depth example of a topology that computes statistics on Twitter data in real time. The example introduces the use of tick tuples, which are useful for topologies that need to compute statistics or do other things on a schedule. In this chapter, you also see how topologies can access configuration data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Persistence Using Redis and MongoDB">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Persistence Using Redis and MongoDB</em>, updates the sample Twitter topology for the use of Redis, a popular key-value store. It shows you how to simplify the complex Python calculation logic with built-in Redis operations. The chapter concludes with an example of storing Twitter data in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, and using its aggregation capabilities to generate reports.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Petrel in Practice">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Petrel in Practice</em>, teaches practical skills that will make developers more productive using Storm. You learn how to use Petrel to create automated tests for your spout and bolt components that run outside of Storm. You also see how to use a graphical debugger to debug a topology running inside Storm.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Managing Storm Using Supervisord">Appendix</a>, <em>Managing Storm Using Supervisord</em>, is a practical demonstration of monitoring and control of Storm using a supervisor over the cluster.</p></div></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You will need a computer with Python 2.7, Java 7 JDK, and Apache Storm 0.9.3. Ubuntu is recommended but not required.</p></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for beginners as well as advanced Python developers who want to use Storm to process big data in real time. While familiarity with the Java runtime environment is helpful for installing and configuring Storm, all the code examples in this book are in Python.</p></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Storm configurations can be done using <code class="literal">storm.yaml</code>, which is present in the <code class="literal">conf</code> folder".</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">import nltk.corpus

from petrel import storm
from petrel.emitter import BasicBolt

class SplitSentenceBolt(BasicBolt):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SplitSentenceBolt, self).__init__(script=__file__)
        self.stop = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))
        self.stop.update(['http', 'https', 'rt'])</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>import logging</strong>
from collections import defaultdict

from petrel import storm
from petrel.emitter import BasicBolt</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>tail -f petrel24748_totalrankings.log</strong></pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Finally, click on <strong>Create your Twitter application</strong>".</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div></div>
