    amazing resource. It provides access to a wealth of data and tools that can greatly
    enhance the abilities of your GIS. But, can you add your own data and maps to
    your content, or are you limited to the content that is already there?

    methods you can use to publish it. Files can be directly uploaded to ArcGIS Online
    via your web browser. Maps and scenes can be published directly from ArcGIS Pro.
    The best method will depend on the content type, size, and desired capabilities.
    The number of credits you have can also influence the method.

    your own content to ArcGIS Online. You will upload a shapefile and a CSV file
    to ArcGIS Online. You will then configure the ArcGIS Online options associated
    with the uploaded files. Next, you will publish a layer package from ArcGIS Pro
    to your ArcGIS Online content. From there, you will learn how to publish both
    an entire 2D map and 3D scene to ArcGIS Online. Lastly, you will explore simple
    methods for sharing some of the new content you have published.

- en: ArcGIS Online can be used as a repository for GIS data and files. Putting these
    files up in ArcGIS Online allows you to access the information anywhere you have
    an internet connection, much like Google Drive or DropBox. It also allows you
    to use that data to create web maps and share them with others. This can greatly
    increase the overall flexibility of you GIS by making the data available whenever
    you need it, and not just when you are back in the office.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are going to upload and publish files to ArcGIS Online, some of them
    may need to be prepared or configured before you upload them. For example, a shapefile
    must be compressed into a single ZIP file before you are able to publish it to
    ArcGIS Online. This is because each shapefile actually consists of multiple files.
    If you remember from [Chapter 2](b6f25e84-28a9-4d2d-aaca-3550460d4650.xhtml),
    *Creating and Storing Data*, a single shapefile will consist of a SHP, SHX, and
    DBF file at a minimum. Additional files such as a PRJ, SBN, and SBX might also
    exist. All of these files make up a single shapefile. So, it makes sense that
    in order to publish it to ArcGIS Online, you would need to compress all these
    files into a single ZIP file first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The formatting required for a CSV or TXT file will depend on how you intend
    to use it in ArcGIS Online. If you just want to make the file available to download,
    then no formatting is required. However, if you want to map the data included
    in the file, then specific formatting is required. You will explore that in the
    following recipe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you will upload a shapefile and CSV file to your ArcGIS Online
    content. You will start by zipping a shapefile which represents the city limits
    of Trippville. You will use that data later as a layer in a new web map you will
    create. Then, you will upload a CSV file containing natural wildlife view locations
    a friend has sent you.

    in ArcGIS Pro, along with the data. The data referenced by the layer can be stored
    in various formats, including geodatabase feature classes, shapefiles, spreadsheets,

    any or all of these access methods. All of this make web maps very versatile.

- en: If you are going to publish a map from ArcGIS Pro as a web map, you need to
    ensure it is optimized to provide the greatest performance. In general, this means
    that simpler is better. You want to use simple symbology; basic line patterns,
    simple marker symbols, and generic polygon fills. Another thing you can do to
    improve performance is to apply scale ranges that turn on and off layers automatically
    as the user zooms in or out. Limit the use of labels; labels can greatly hinder
    the performance of a web map because they require a lot of processing to render.
    Limiting the number of layers to only those you absolutely need for the given
    map will also help it perform better. Each map should have a specific purpose.
    Make sure each layer in the map supports that primary purpose.
