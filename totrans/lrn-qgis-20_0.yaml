- en: Welcome to *Learning QGIS 2.0*. This book aims to introduce you to QGIS 2 and
    how to perform core geospatial tasks using this popular open source GIS. It takes
    you through five chapters, from QGIS installation and setup in the first chapter,
    to the essentials of viewing spatial data in the second chapter. The third chapter
    covers data creation and editing, followed by the fourth chapter, which offers
    an introduction to performing spatial analysis in QGIS. In the final chapter,
    you will learn how to create great maps and how to prepare them for print.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with QGIS"), *Getting Started
    with QGIS*, covers the installation and configuration of QGIS. We will also get
    to know the user interface and how to customize it. By the end of this chapter,
    you will have QGIS running on your machine and be ready to start with the tutorials.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Viewing Spatial Data"), *Viewing Spatial
    Data*, covers how to view spatial data from different data sources. QGIS supports
    many file and database formats as well as OGC web services. We will first see
    how we can load layers from these different data sources. Then, we will look into
    the basics of styling both vector and raster layers and will create our first
    map. We will finish this chapter with an example for loading background maps from
    online services.'

    and Editing*, covers the creation of new vector layers. Then, we will cover how
    to select features and take measurements before we continue with editing feature
    geometries and attributes. We will then reproject vector and raster data and learn
    how to convert between different file formats before we end this chapter with
    joining data from text files and spreadsheets to our spatial data.'

    raster processing and analysis tasks such as clipping and terrain analysis. Then,
    we cover converting between raster and vector formats before we continue with
    common vector geoprocessing tasks such as generating heatmaps and calculating
    area shares within a region. Finally, we will finish the chapter with an exercise
    in automating a geoprocessing workflow using the QGIS Processing modeler.'

    covers important features that enable us to create great maps. We will go into
    advanced vector styling, building on what we learned in [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Viewing Spatial Data"), *Viewing Spatial Data*. Then, we will cover
    labeling using examples of labeling point locations as well as creating more advanced
    road labels with road shield graphics. We will also cover how to tweak labels
    manually. Finally, we will get to know the print composer and how to use it to
    create printable maps and map books.'
