- en: The initial quantum circuit model of computation as a time-ordered sequence
    of logical quantum gates performing a unitary evolution of the state of a quantum
    register has evolved into a tightly integrated model of dynamic quantum circuits
    that allow concurrent classical processing of mid-circuit measurement results
    [Corcoles] [IBM_mid]. This new paradigm of dynamic quantum computation paves the
    way to a smooth transition from classical to quantum-boosted computing.

    quantum computation [Auffeves] [Q Daily] [Quantum_AI] [Thibault]. The quantum
    supremacy experiment [Arute] involved an energy consumption three orders of magnitude
    smaller than the one a high-performance computer would require to achieve an exact
    computation of the expected result of the experiment. Determining the conditions
    under which an energetic quantum advantage could be achieved is an open research
    topic [Auffeves].

    is stored in the vibrational motion of atom pairs held in a superposition of two
    vibrational states opens the perspective of programmable quantum simulators of
    molecules [Hartke]. The accurate calculations of the vibrational spectra of molecules,
    which have applications from astrochemistry to biochemistry and climate change
    mitigation, might be easier to achieve on a quantum computer than electronic energy
    calculations [Sawaya].

    Eigensolver (VQE) Algorithm*, we illustrated some of the methods of quantum computational
    chemistry with Python and open-source quantum chemistry packages PySCF, ASE, PyQMC,
    and Qiskit, solving for the ground state energy level and plotting the BOPES of
    the hydrogen molecule, the lithium hydride molecule, and the macro-molecule ONCHHC.
    With the simplest basis (STO-3G), and with a noise-free simulation of a quantum
    circuit (statevector simulator), the different methods of calculations were in
    good agreement.

- en: Scientific or industrial applications require highly accurate relative energy
    estimates of about 1 milli-Hartree (mHA) or even 0.1 mHA of chemical reaction
    mechanisms. The same accuracy is required for the total electronic energy of each
    molecule species involved in a chemical reaction of interest [Burg]. The authors
    of a benchmark of algorithms for calculating the electronic structures of molecules
    of relevance to prebiotic chemistry have concluded that "To utilize VQE and achieve
    near chemical accuracy will be extremely challenging for NISQ processors" [Lolur].
    They point out that the main challenge is the large number of Pauli terms resulting
    from the mapping of fermionic to qubit Hamiltonian, the large number of variational
    parameters, and the large number of energy evaluations. Furthermore, to get an
    accurate energy estimate of 1 mHA, the ansatz for the VQE must be close to the
    true ground state by less than one in a million [Troyer].

    we explained how non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) calculations include the effects
    that are needed to make better predictions of chemical states at above ground
    state vibrations. Implementing these non-BO calculations with innovative hybrid
    classical-quantum algorithms is an open research topic. Ryan Babbush, head of
    Google's quantum algorithms team, has developed the first quantized quantum simulations
    algorithms for chemistry. In the introduction of his presentation of these algorithms
    [Babbush], he stated that there are lots of contexts where non-BO simulations
    are important, such as low temperatures where hydrogen bondings are involved,
    or tunneling or couplings between electrons and nuclei, or to compute dynamics,
    reactive scattering coefficients, or thermo rate constants directly from quantum
    dynamics. A study of these algorithms [Su] has shown potential advantages to algorithms
    in second quantization. However, these algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum
    computers with several thousand logical qubits able to run quantum circuits with
    a huge number of gates (![](img/Formula_07_001.png) to ![](img/Formula_07_002.png)),
    way beyond the capabilities of the current or near-term NISQ-era processors.
