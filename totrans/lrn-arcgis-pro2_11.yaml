- en: In the previous chapter, you learned how to edit spatial data using ArcGIS Pro.
    But the spatial data is only one half of the **Geographical Information System**
    (**GIS**) data. The other half is the attribute or tabular data that is connected
    to the spatial data. Being able to keep the attributes updated is just as important
    as maintaining the spatial data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you have seen in previous chapters, the attribute table, which is part of
    a feature class and layer, is used in many ways. You can use it to configure the
    symbology used to display a layer in a map. Attribute values are used to help
    define feature templates used to create new features. You can query values in
    the attribute to select features for analysis or editing. These are just a few
    ways you can make use of the data stored in the attribute table for a layer. So,
    it is just as important to ensure it stays as up to date as the spatial features
    that it is connected to.

    So schema is not just a GIS term but it is also a term used for other databases
    as well. In the case of a GIS database, schema refers to things such as what feature
    classes are stored in the database, what attribute fields are linked to those
    feature classes, what domains are included in the database, whether any tables
    or feature classes are related, and more.'

    allow you to add new feature classes, add fields, and create domains. It does
    have some limitations currently such as you cannot create a topology or geometric
    network. Hopefully, as ArcGIS Pro continues to mature those limitations will disappear.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes changing your schema is as simple as adding a new field to an attribute
    table. A field is a column within a database table. The actual act of adding a
    field within ArcGIS Pro is not overly complicated, especially when compared to
    editing the spatial data. However, it does require some thought.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When adding a new field, you need to think through the properties that will
    be associated with that field, such as field name and field type, which we will
    cover in the next few sections.
  prefs: []

- en: Field name
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a database table, each field must have a unique name. That name cannot include
    spaces or special characters, though underscores are allowed. The allowed length
    of the field name will depend on the type of database. *Is it a***dBase***,***Access***,
    or***SQL Server***table?* Each of these has its own limitations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a rule of thumb, I have learned that keeping my field names limited to 7
    to 8 characters works best. This will prevent field names from getting shortened
    if you export the data to a different format that does not support the name length
    of your native database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This often happens when your GIS data is stored as a geodatabase that supports
    long field names, but you export to a shapefile that does not. Shapefiles store
    attributes in a **dBase** format that does not support long field names. Being
    an older database type, dBase only supports field names of 7 to 8 characters.
    So, a field that is named as `parcel_indentification_number` in your geodatabase
    may get renamed to `parcel_in` when exported to a shapefile.

    no decimal places. The difference between long and short integer varies somewhat
    depending on the database, but generally short integers can store values between
    -33,000 to 33,000\. Long will store values between approximately -2.1 billion
    and 2.1 billion. | It provides the best performance of all field types. This makes

    values into the designated field within a table using an expression. This expression
    can be as simple as copying values from another field, or as complex as performing
    a series of mathematical equations and logical functions. These expressions can
    be written in either **Python** or **Arcade**. You will learn a little more about
    these two languages in [Chapters 12](7747c679-b20b-47b2-946d-a1f8c5a9ded0.xhtml),
    *Automating Processes with ModelBuilder and Python*, and [Chapter 14](6292840b-2580-45a1-837a-79d372d19b7d.xhtml),

    of within the Geoprocessing pane. This means, if you have records in the table

    have any records selected, this tool will populate values in the field for all
    records in the table overwriting any existing information.

    field based on spatial values. You can use this tool to calculate things such
    as area, perimeter, central coordinates, number of vertices, and more. The exact
    spatial characteristics that you can calculate will be dependent on the geometry
    type of the features in question. For example, you cannot use the Calculate Geometry
    tool to calculate the area for point features because a point does not have an
    area.
  prefs: []

    that was created in imperial units, but you need to know its area in square kilometers.

    metric units without you knowing the exact conversation factor.
