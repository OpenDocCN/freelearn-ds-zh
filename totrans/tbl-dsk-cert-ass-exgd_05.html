<p class="mce-root">Now that you can connect to data and understand the various elements of the worksheet, it is time to start analyzing data. Data analysis and visualization go hand in hand in Tableau. Data visualization enables us to quickly understand and interpret the various trends in data. Tableau provides extensive options to slice and dice the data, and view it in different formats using visualizations, sets, filters, hierarchies, and so on. This chapter will detail each of these formats.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key charts in Tableau </li>
<li>Sorting your data</li>
<li>Creating filters, sets, groups, and hierarchies</li>
<li>Formatting your visuals</li>

<p>Tableau provides a variety of charts that are super quick and easy to create. All charts in Tableau are created based on marks, where marks are the rows in your dataset for any given combination of dimensions and measures. To create a chart, you have two broad options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the dimensions and measures you want to plot and click on the <strong>Show me</strong> window. The <strong>Show Me</strong> window is a special window where all of the default charts in Tableau and their details can be found. For example, select <span><span class="packt_screen">Category</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Sales</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Measures</span>. Use the <em>Ctrl</em> key (the <em>Command</em> key on macOS) to select multiple elements. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <span class="packt_screen">Show Me</span> window can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1575 image-border" src="assets/0352d114-e5d0-4be9-9728-90c344caa16e.png" style="width:55.67em;height:30.75em;"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the <strong>Show Me</strong> window currently contains 24 graphs. However, only one is highlighted with an red square around it, seven others are activated, and the rest are grayed out. The highlighted graph is the graph recommended by Tableau based on your data. The graphs that are grayed out are those that can't be created with a combination of the chosen fields. To discover what is needed to generate a graph, you simply hover over it. For instance, in this case of the bar graph, we can see that, for <span class="packt_screen">horizontal bars</span>, we need <span class="packt_screen">0 or more</span> <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> and <span class="packt_screen">1 or more</span> <span class="packt_screen">Measures</span>. Similarly, if you hover over other charts, it will list their requirements. Once your data meets the requirements, you can select the chart type and it will be displayed on the screen. </p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the dimensions and measures directly onto the sheet's <strong>Rows</strong>, <strong>Columns</strong>, and <strong>Marks</strong> shelves.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The following screenshot displays a </span><span>combination of items, using which you can create charts directly without using the <strong>Show Me</strong> Window:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1463 image-border" src="assets/d3442eba-7de9-42be-8666-7db2ca71435f.png" style="width:55.17em;height:36.33em;"/></p>
<p><span>These options are also going to be useful when enhancing the standard chart types on the <span class="packt_screen">Show Me</span> window to create more advanced charts. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root">Using <kbd>Category</kbd> and <kbd>Sales</kbd>, if you want to see the categories and their sum of sales listed as a value, you can drag <kbd>Category</kbd> to the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> and then <kbd>Sales</kbd> to the <span class="packt_screen">Text Label</span> on the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> shelf. This will create <span class="packt_screen">Fig(a)</span>, as shown in the following screenshot. Similarly, if you remove <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> from the text shelf and drag it to the <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> shelf, you get the horizontal bar graph shown in <span class="packt_screen">Fig(b)</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1464 image-border" src="assets/10b37548-c22a-42a6-9d46-95d54e19317c.png" style="width:145.83em;height:43.25em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_tip packt_infobox">It is important to note that whenever you pick up a measure to bring into a worksheet, it will always aggregate automatically, based on the best aggregation type for that data. The most common aggregate types are <strong>Sum</strong> and <strong>Average. </strong>You have the option to change the aggregate type of a measure. If you do not want to see the measure as an aggregate, you can also deselect <span class="packt_screen">Aggregate measures</span> and<span> </span><span>view it as raw data with no aggregation.</span></div>
<div>
<p>Now that you know how charts can be created, we will move on to the next section where we will discuss important chart types and when to use them.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Text tables (cross-tabs)</h1>
                </header>

<p>Text tables are similar to Excel grids, that is, they contain rows, columns, and values in a grid. These tables are very useful when there is limited data, and you want to see the exact number quickly, or if you need to find the intersection points between categories (equivalent to a cell in Excel). </p>
<p><span>For example, what was the total <span class="packt_screen">Shipping Cost</span> for <span class="packt_screen">Office Supplies</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span> <span class="packt_screen">Segment</span>?</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To create this table, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <kbd>Segment</kbd>, <kbd>Category</kbd>, and <kbd>Shipping Cost</kbd> and select the text tables icon (the first graph) from the <strong>Show Me</strong> window.</li>
<li>Alternatively, put <kbd>Segment</kbd> and <kbd>Category</kbd> on <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span>, respectively, and then place <kbd>SUM(Shipping Cost)</kbd> on the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> text shelf, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1101 image-border" src="assets/1eac46ee-359d-4564-bf13-1fc215869cf0.png" style="width:119.25em;height:64.25em;"/></p>
<p>We can quickly see that the <span><span class="packt_screen">Shipping Cost</span> for <span class="packt_screen">Office Supplies</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span> <span class="packt_screen">Segment</span> is <span class="packt_screen">195,935</span>. In this example, I have used <span class="packt_screen">Segment</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Category</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span>, but you can reverse these as necessary. </span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">To quickly swap <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> for any graph, you can click on the <strong>Swap</strong> button, highlighted in<span> red </span>in the picture, or just use the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>W</em> shortcut.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Highlight tables</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Highlight tables are an extension of text tables (or cross-tabs), discussed in the previous section. A highlight table is obtained by adding a field to the <span class="packt_screen">Marks Color</span> shelf. They are useful for quickly seeing trends in data. For example, what if you were asked which <span class="packt_screen">Category</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Segment</span> of the product has more sales than <span class="packt_screen">Office Supplies</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span>, but less profit? One way to solve this would be to look at all of the segments that have more sales than <span class="packt_screen">Office Supply</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span>, and then look at the profits for each of those and see whether they are more or less than the profit for <span class="packt_screen">Office Supply</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span>. An alternative way to look at this is to quickly bring <kbd>SUM(Profit)</kbd> on to the <span class="packt_screen">Marks Color</span> shelf, and change the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> type to <span class="packt_screen">Square</span>. <span><span>This will create the graph shown in this screenshot:</span></span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1102 image-border" src="assets/96a95f64-45fb-47b2-9229-8bb555af8a3f.png" style="width:87.58em;height:55.83em;"/></p>
<p>You can quickly see that, based on sales only, <span class="packt_screen">Furniture</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Technology</span> within the <span class="packt_screen">Consumer Segment</span> have more sales than <span class="packt_screen">Office Supply</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Consumer Segment</span>. Now, looking at the color for <span class="packt_screen">Profits</span>, you quickly know that as <span class="packt_screen">Furniture</span> is colored lighter than <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span>, it has fewer profits than the consumer. </p>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">By default, the automatic gradient of colors in Tableau for <kbd>measures</kbd> goes from lowest to highest. Also, by default, any value below 0 is orange, and <strong>greater</strong> than 0 is blue. </div>

                </header>

<p>Maps are one of the most important visuals present in Tableau that quickly and effectively help to visualize any kind of geographic data. To identify a geographical field, look for the globe icon next to the field. Based on the geographical field, Tableau generates two fields, <span class="packt_screen">Latitude</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Longitude</span>. These are used to pinpoint the exact locations on the map. It is not necessary to use the auto-generated <span class="packt_screen">Latitude</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Longitude</span> fields; you can also upload your own geocoding, which we will cover in more detail in <a href="5b500ca0-cc1f-4396-a2a8-c72cda9bbb13.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Visualizing Geographic Data</em>.</p>
<p>For now, our focus will be on the two map types available in the <strong>Show Me</strong> menu: the symbol map and the filled map. Symbol maps can show up to two measures, whereas filled maps can show only one. Symbol maps are useful to show very granular data or if you need to represent multiple measures on the graph. Filled maps, on the other hand, are very effective for showing a single measure. They also are useful for low-level data, such as that at the city or postcode level.</p>
<p>For example, to view the distribution of <kbd>Sales</kbd> by <kbd>Segment</kbd> in each country, you would use a symbol chart, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1103 image-border" src="assets/6ae4df19-04cf-4266-95bb-aa302b72f9a2.png" style="width:52.50em;height:28.17em;"/></p>
<p>On the other hand, to view which state on the west coast of the USA had the highest sales, you can use a filled map, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104 image-border" src="assets/3c7c9de5-d1ed-4d83-b1c9-010e92113d17.png" style="width:53.42em;height:25.75em;"/></p>
<p>One quick glance at the map and we can tell that California has the highest sales o<span>n the West C</span><span>oast.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Bar charts</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Bar charts are one of the easiest tools for making quick comparisons across categorical data. Bar charts compare data on a linear scale and quickly make it easy to compare data points across dimensions. Tableau has three types of bar chart variants available in the <span class="packt_screen">Show Me</span> menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal bar charts</li>
<li>Stacked bar charts</li>
<li>Side-by-side bar charts</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple bar charts are the best kind of charts to use whenever questions are asked about the largest or smallest values, what dimension values are in the top or bottom five, and so on. As these values are all displayed on a linear scale, they are also useful for quick approximations of data. For example, which product's sales are approximately half of the product with the second-highest number of sales?</p>
<p>Reading the preceding question, it looks a bit convoluted, but it can be quickly solved using a bar chart using <kbd>Product Name</kbd> and <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd>. Once the graph is sorted according to the descending values of sales, we get the following bar chart:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1105 image-border" src="assets/4ef4b778-aa38-4800-bbb6-500d7dc089a0.png" style="width:109.50em;height:67.83em;"/></p>
<p>A quick glance at the graph shows the second-highest product to be a Nokia smartphone with sales worth approximately <span class="packt_screen">70k</span>. Half of this is <span class="packt_screen">35k</span> and, again, a quick glance at the graph shows us that the product in question is <span class="packt_screen">Cisco Smart Phon</span><span class="packt_screen">e</span>. As the value of sales used is not exact in this example, it saves us time in calculations, allowing us to quickly reach our results.</p>
<p>The higher the complexity of the dimensions that you want to compare against, the more you can nest your bar graph to easily get results. The following example compares values across <span class="packt_screen">Category</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Segment</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Market</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1106 image-border" src="assets/42a1acf2-4dc2-4cff-aabd-413d37267c0a.png" style="width:110.50em;height:54.17em;"/></p>
<p>A pattern quickly emerges, with the <span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span> <span class="packt_screen">Segment</span> having the highest sales across regions and categories as compared to <span class="packt_screen">Corporate</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Home Office</span>. We can also quickly see that while <span class="packt_screen">APAC</span> leads the <span class="packt_screen">Technology</span> category in the <span class="packt_screen">Home Office Segment</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Europe</span> is the leader for the <span class="packt_screen">Office Supplies</span> category in the <span class="packt_screen">Home Office Segment</span>. Canada <span>has the least sales </span><span>across all segments and categories</span><span>.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">Bar charts are the best tool for comparison of the same value against multiple dimensions. </div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
<p>Now, let's move on from simple bar charts to stacked bar charts. The latter is useful for understanding proportions. An example that uses stacked bar charts to see the proportion of quantity shipped using different shipping modes and segments can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
</div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 image-border" src="assets/94be2625-4f09-4306-8e22-955e93c2ad1d.png" style="width:126.75em;height:44.33em;"/> </div>
<div>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Consumer</span> had the highest proportion of its quantity shipped under <span class="packt_screen">Standard Class Ship Mode</span>. </p>
</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Do not use stacked bar charts if there are too many dimensions to compare as it can become very confusing. Instead, use side-by-side bars or nested bars.</div>
<p>Side by side bar graphs provide another way to compare measures. The main difference from a stacked bar is that the axis remains the same in a side-by-side bar chart. For instance, if we change the preceding stacked bar graph to a side by side bar, we obtain the following:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 image-border" src="assets/a02b28ca-9366-4046-b23a-25776b152f32.png" style="width:106.25em;height:64.58em;"/></div>
<p>It is the same information presented in a different format. If you want to compare and need absolute value comparisons, side by side graphs are the ones to use. However, if you are more interested in the proportions when comparing and how they change, stacked graphs are the way to go.</p>
<p>Stacked bars are also generally used to represent the percentage of the total population.</p>
<p>For example, to view the percentage of sales distributed by shipping mode across regions, you will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a simple stacked chart using <kbd>Region</kbd>, <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd>, and <kbd>Ship Mode</kbd>.</li>
<li><span>Right-click</span> <kbd>Sum(Sales)</kbd><span>. Select <span class="packt_screen">Quick Table</span></span> <span class="packt_screen">Calculation | Percent of Total</span>.</li>
<li><span>You will notice there is no change in the graph yet. This is because the table calculation isn't being calculated as Table across. To change this, once again right-click</span> <kbd>Sum(Sales)</kbd><span>. Select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Compute Using | Table Down</span><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This should give you the graph as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 image-border" src="assets/da4666a8-59c0-4809-9c5a-637011a0c34c.png" style="width:90.33em;height:67.00em;"/></div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Heat maps and treemaps</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Heat maps and treemaps are useful for when looking for patterns in highly granular and detailed data. Heat maps use a combination of size and color to show trends. For example, which subcategory has the lowest profit in the region that has the highest quantity sold? To answer this question, we create a heat map similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1110 image-border" src="assets/1ed58064-a8a0-45be-b0b8-98baeb84871d.png" style="width:45.08em;height:22.58em;"/></p>
<p>Using the heat map, we can quickly see based on the sizes of the squares that the <span class="packt_screen">Central</span> region has the highest quantity sold and the <span class="packt_screen">Tables</span> sub-category within it has the least profit.</p>
<p>Treemaps are another type of graph that is useful for looking at broad trends. They allow you to show up to four measures. For example, in the example shown in the following screenshot, we can look at <kbd>SUM(Profit)</kbd> (color), <kbd>SUM(Quantity)</kbd> (size), and <kbd>SUM(Discount)</kbd> (text value) across regions and markets:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1111 image-border" src="assets/16625ce6-4534-4fd5-b5eb-3e6b57045ece.png" style="width:45.25em;height:21.25em;"/></p>
<p>We can, in one glance, see that the <span class="packt_screen">Central EU</span> region has the highest profit and sales, having a total discount of <span class="packt_screen">531.8</span>. On the other hand, the profit of <span class="packt_screen">South East Asia </span>in the <span class="packt_screen">APAC</span> region is quite low, despite the sales being quite high. The market also has the highest discount value for all markets at <span class="packt_screen">851.3</span>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>So far, all of the graphs we have discussed have been used to analyze aggregate measures. The next category of graphs benefits more from analyzing measures in their raw or unaggregated form, though, it is not a prerequisite for their usage. These graphs are useful for detecting outliers in the data or seeing the relationship between two measures. Outlier detection is useful in understanding how much outliers influence statistical measures such as the sum and average. Outlier detection also becomes very powerful in detecting fraud or errors. For example, which three customers were responsible for the highest individual sales?</p>
<p>To view this, we create a <span class="packt_screen">Circle Plot</span> for <span class="packt_screen">Sales</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Customer Name</span>s. Once we have the circle plot created, you'll realize that the <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> shelf still shows <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> in the measures. To remove this, you must go to the <strong>Analysis Menu</strong> and unselect <strong>Aggregate Measures</strong>.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you'll see a graph like the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1112 image-border" src="assets/af2e385b-9047-41e9-a918-4a2b7a0de8ad.png" style="width:20.42em;height:22.00em;"/></p>
<p>Hovering over the top three candidates' circles, we find that Sean Miller, Tamara Chand, and Raymond Buch have the highest individual sales values. Considering how much of an outlier Sean Miller's sales value is, it could also be a potential error in the data.</p>
<p>Side by side circle views are similar to side by side bar graphs and more useful when looking at unaggregated data, though they can be used for aggregated data as well. For example, to find how the priority of an item varies in terms of price across regions, we can use a side by side circle graph like the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1113 image-border" src="assets/0714ee27-35de-4779-97bb-440b6ae0c5b8.png" style="width:62.25em;height:32.33em;"/></p>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, we can see that lower-values sales have higher-order priority than higher-value sales in general across all markets. </p>
<p>Scatter plots are useful for understanding relationships between the measures themselves. For example, what is the relationship between shipping cost and sales across various categories of products? Looking at the following screenshot, it is easy to see that there is less variance in the shipping cost and sales value of furniture than there is for technology. Some of the highest and lowest shipping costs are seen for the <span class="packt_screen">Technology</span> category for similar values of <span class="packt_screen">Sales</span>:</p>

<p>Line charts are the best way to show data related to time. They connect distinct data points presenting them continuously and can show time either as discrete or continuous entities. Discrete time series are useful for comparison of one-time dimensions across another, for example, to find out which two quarters had the least difference in sales across all four years. One quick glance at the <span class="packt_screen">Discrete Line Chart</span> graph tells us the answer is Q2 and Q3. Continuous line charts, on the other hand, are useful for understanding the overall trends across time. For example, in the following graph, we can quickly see that sales have increased overall across the 4 years irrespective of the seasonal variations:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1115 image-border" src="assets/edfb4c70-4977-4dd2-8598-2fc1997a683a.png" style="width:46.75em;height:17.92em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">If you right-click on the date, you can change the level of detail the <span class="packt_screen">Date</span> is displayed at. The date menu divides the dates into two date sections. The first group provides by default discrete date parts and the second continuous date values, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1576 image-border" src="assets/22d1dc7f-b992-45fc-8056-52176f90125e.png" style="width:19.67em;height:27.75em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">The <strong>Date Part</strong> values individual parts of the date, for example, if the date is December 10, 2018, then the various date parts would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Day: 10</li>
<li class="mce-root">Month: December</li>
<li class="mce-root">Year: 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>The discrete line chart in the preceding example uses the <span class="packt_screen">Year</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Quarter</span> date parts. </p>
<p class="mce-root">Date values, on the other hand, are dates truncated to the level you have selected. For example, if you had the date December 10, 2018, the date value at different levels would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Day: 10 December 2018</li>
<li class="mce-root">Month: December 2018</li>
<li class="mce-root">Year: 2018</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">The preceding continuous line chart uses the <span class="packt_screen">Quarter<span> </span></span><span>date value,</span><span> which will truncate the dates to the level of quarters. </span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Though, by default, date parts are discrete and date values are continuous, we can use the discrete and continuous options to change this. The key difference is that discrete values will show headers while continuous values will show axes when displaying the visualization. </div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Histograms</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Histograms are useful for viewing the distribution of continuous data into ranges or bins. They are used to determine whether a measure is left-skewed, right-skewed, or normally distributed and are widely used when describing demographic statistics such as the age distribution of the population or the distribution of wealth among a certain population. </p>
<p>The way histograms work is that they divide the entire dataset into bins (ranges of data). For example, if we want to understand how <span class="packt_screen">Quantity</span> is distributed, we get the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1117 image-border" src="assets/0ae71d7c-4fff-4d11-b412-b2a625b40d41.png" style="width:58.25em;height:35.75em;"/></p>
<p>A count of 2 or 3 seems to be the most common quantities sold, whereas larger numbers such as 12 and 13 are rare. You can also notice in the distribution that the mean of the data (3.66) is on the right of the median (3.18). Such a distribution is called a right-skewed distribution. The reverse of this is a left-skewed distribution. If both the left and right sides are balanced, it is termed a normal distribution.</p>
<p>Whenever you create a histogram, you will notice that, in the <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> shelf, a new <span class="packt_screen">Dimension</span> called <kbd>Quantity (Bin)</kbd> appears. You can edit this bin by right-clicking on it in the <span class="packt_screen">Data</span> pane and selecting <strong>Edit</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1118 image-border" src="assets/5b7982d7-ca50-44b8-8591-15faccbcab9a.png" style="width:40.08em;height:18.67em;"/></p>
<p>Here, you can set the <strong>Size of bins</strong>, <strong>Range of Values</strong> to include, the name, and so on.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If any question asks about the skew of the data or the left-/right-tailed distribution, then you need to use a histogram. </div>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While circle charts are useful for detecting outliers for continuous measures, box and whisker plots (simply referred to as box plots) are useful for understanding the statistical distribution of a continuous measure in terms of the median and interquartile ranges. The box and whisker plots consist of five key components: the median, the upper hinge, the lower hinge, the upper whisker, and the lower whisker. The median is the midway point or the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the data. The upper and lower hinges show the first and the third quartiles, respectively. The whiskers extend up to 1.5 times the <strong>Interquartile Range</strong> (<strong>IQR</strong>) from the hinges, where IQR is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. We can change the whisker limits to extend up to the minimum and maximum values in the chart too.</p>
<p>For example, what is the interquartile range for <span class="packt_screen">Quantity</span> in <span class="packt_screen">APAC</span>?</p>
<p>To answer, we use <span class="packt_screen">Market</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Quantity</span> to create a box and whiskers plot. Like with circle and scatter plots, you need to go to <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> and unselect <span class="packt_screen">Aggregate Measures</span>. We get the following graph:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1120 image-border" src="assets/8bf1afc1-9063-496d-a43d-9c0d8d5dbb8b.png" style="width:21.42em;height:35.67em;"/></p>
<p>For <span class="packt_screen">APAC</span>, we can see the <span class="packt_screen">Lower Hinge</span> is <span class="packt_screen">2</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">Upper Hinge</span> is <span class="packt_screen">5</span>, so <em>IQR = 5-2 = 3</em>.</p>
<p>The upper whisker can extend 1.5 times the IQR from the upper hinge, so <em>5+ (1.5*3) = 9.5</em>. The closest data point lower than this in the dataset is 9, hence the upper whisker gets the value 9. Similarly, the lower whisker can extend 1.5 times the lower hinge, so <em>2-1.5*3 = -2.5</em>. The lowest data point in the dataset closest to this value is 1. Hence, the lower whisker is at 1.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Remember, the <em>Interquartile Range (IQR) = Upper Hinge - Lower Hinge</em>. <br/>
<br/>
The lower and upper whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Gantt chart</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Gantt charts are a popular project management tool used for tracking the time between activities. The chart consists of tasks or events on the vertical axis and time intervals on the horizontal axis. One popular use of a Gantt chart is to understand the project management schedules and the dependencies between the various events. Another common use is to understand the time difference between events.</p>
<p>For example, a popular method is to look at the average <span class="packt_screen">Order to Ship Time</span> across the different shipping modes and any other dimension/s such as <kbd>Order Category/Sub-category/Market</kbd>. We will look at this example for <span class="packt_screen">Market</span>. To create the Gantt chart, we will need a calculation for <kbd>Order to Ship Time</kbd>. We can create one as follows (<span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Create Calculated Field</span>):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1121 image-border" src="assets/dd813523-2328-49c5-a75c-5df8924b90e2.png" style="width:25.17em;height:5.67em;"/></p>
<p>Now, to create a Gantt chart, we set up the chart as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span><span>Columns</span></span></strong>:<strong> </strong><kbd>Day(Order Date)</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Rows</strong>:<strong> </strong><kbd>Market</kbd> and <kbd>Ship Mode</kbd> </li>
<li><strong>Marks Color:</strong> <kbd>Ship Mode (Optional)</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: <kbd>Avg(Order to Ship Time)</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>We have converted this to be the average since it makes more sense to understand the average <span class="packt_screen">Order to Ship Time</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1122 image-border" src="assets/9122cc32-b452-4012-9dd2-a0f2a43a690e.png" style="width:67.08em;height:31.58em;"/></p>
<p>We can quickly see the time across the different shipping modes. If we filter for smaller ranges, the Gantt chart becomes more effective.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Combination charts allow us to view a combination of values in the same visual, for example, a line chart to show the sum of sales and a bar chart to show the profits. <span>An example of a famous combination chart is a Pareto chart.</span></p>
<p>Combination charts allow us to compare data either on the same axes or use two separate distinct axes to work with the data. A minimum of two measures is needed to create a combination chart. To create a combination chart, select <kbd>Profit</kbd>, <kbd>Sales</kbd>, and <kbd>Order Date</kbd> and select <strong>Dual Combination</strong> from the <strong>Show Me</strong> menu. By default, the chart will get created at the level of <kbd>Year(Order Date)</kbd>. Right-click on it, and change it to be at the level of a quarter. You will obtain the following graph, where you will see <kbd>SUM(Profit)</kbd> is shown as a bar chart and <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> as a line chart:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1123 image-border" src="assets/077fb95c-d697-42b2-acaa-dc4fc87b929b.png" style="width:60.92em;height:38.50em;"/></p>
<p>From the graph, if you don't pay close attention to the axes, it appears that the scales of <kbd>SUM(Profit)</kbd> and <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> are the same. However, we can see from the axes that <strong>20K</strong> in profits corresponds to <strong>200K</strong> in sales value.</p>
<p>To synchronize the axes, right-click on one of the axes and select <strong>Synchronize Axis.</strong><strong> </strong>This changes the graph, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1124 image-border" src="assets/e7de24bc-f26d-47e3-8b13-9bb79cd24e9e.png" style="width:56.25em;height:35.83em;"/></p>
<p>Now that we have learned about the various types of charts available in the <strong>Show Me</strong> menu, how to create them, and when they are most useful, let's look at some of the key properties that be can be used to enhance these visuals.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Sorting your data</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Sorting data allows for patterns to be quickly visible. Tableau allows us to have simple ascending and descending sorting, manual sorting, nested sorting, and sorting based on some calculation. We can sort not only on the fields displayed on the graphs but also in any other field. To sort data, we can use any of the quick sort icons shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1125 image-border" src="assets/f034a9cb-c11f-4065-b0fa-982e95c811c0.png" style="width:50.92em;height:30.33em;"/></p>
<p>To view the sorting for each dimension, right-click on each of the dimension pills. Once you click on it, you will see options to <span class="packt_screen">Sort By</span> multiple categories; here, you select from <span class="packt_screen">Data Source Order</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Alphabetical Order</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Manual Sorting</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Field</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Nested</span>. For example, in the preceding, <kbd>Market</kbd> was sorted using <span class="packt_screen">Data Source Order</span>: <span class="packt_screen">Ascending</span> and <kbd>Ship Mode</kbd> was sorted using <span class="packt_screen">Nested</span> based on the <kbd>SUM(Discount)</kbd> field. You can select any field and aggregation here, and they don't need to be necessarily used in the graphs. Another way to sort is to drag the fields in the graph manually.</p>
<p>For stacked graphs, sorting stacks can be done by moving the legends. In the following example, as <span class="packt_screen">US</span> was at the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Color</span> legend, it appeared as the bottom category in the graph. Shifting <span class="packt_screen">US</span> to the top in the <span class="packt_screen">Color</span> legend also changes its position in the graph:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1577 image-border" src="assets/ffc29c4a-61f7-419c-a2d5-038201d7c9b7.png" style="width:39.42em;height:22.50em;"/></p>
<p><span><span>Now that you can create the various charts and know how to sort data, let's look at what other features can be used to enhance your data and visuals. </span></span></p>

<p>Beyond sorting the data, Tableau provides many other ways to enhance visuals. Filters, sets, groups and hierarchies are some important ones. We will look at each in detail in this section, starting with filters.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Filtering</strong> is a major part of data analysis. Tableau allows us to filter using dimensions or measures. Filtering in Tableau follows this order of operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract filters </li>
<li>Data source filters</li>
<li><span>Context filters</span></li>
<li>Filters on dimensions</li>
<li>Filters on measures</li>
</ol>
<p>To apply filters to any visual, drag the field to the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> shelf, or select within the graph what to include/exclude. For example, to find <kbd>Profit</kbd> by <kbd>Market</kbd> for the <span class="packt_screen">Standard Class</span> shipping mode, drag <kbd>Ship Mode</kbd> to the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> shelf. Once you drag it to the shelf, you will be asked how you want the data filtered. This mode differs for dimensions and measures. For dimensions, there are the options of <span class="packt_screen">General</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Wildcard</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Condition</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Top</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General</strong>: Allows us to include/exclude from a list, use a custom list, or use all of the values</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Useful for pattern matching</li>
<li><strong>Condition</strong>: Filtering based on other fields or custom calculations</li>
<li><strong>Top</strong>: Creates a subset of top/bottom fields and filters using those</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">The filters get evaluated from the left to right tab, so general tab filters get evaluated first and the top tabs last. </div>
<p>The <strong>General</strong> filter tab is the most used, and for this example, we will simply select <strong>Standard Class</strong> from the <strong>General</strong> tab, as can be seen in the following screenshot, and click <strong>OK</strong>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1127 image-border" src="assets/4b6c2449-edc0-44db-b194-137013f7c170.png" style="width:60.75em;height:26.58em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">Once you click <span class="packt_screen">O</span>K, the filter gets displayed on the screen and becomes a quick filter for easy access. <span>If it doesn't get displayed on the screen by default, then right-click on the <strong>Dimension</strong> and choose the <strong>Show Filter</strong> option. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root">Quick filters have many options that can be accessed by clicking on the options button on the top right of the filter, as shown in the following screenshot. Explore the various options to use as per your requirement:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1128 image-border" src="assets/b580f5af-2b14-45b9-aa99-e52e73f7566f.png" style="width:16.58em;height:32.50em;"/></p>
<p>Another way to filter data for any visual is to select the data you want to see in the visual and, in the option box that appears, select <span class="packt_screen">Keep Only</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Exclude</span>, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129 image-border" src="assets/82c318a3-473a-498d-a40d-88cd64aed20e.png" style="width:40.92em;height:11.00em;"/></p>

<p>Sets are custom fields that are used to define a subset of data. The defined subset can be dynamic or static and can be used to create different visuals. We can also combine multiple sets. Sets have the advantage of being reusable across all worksheets, and they get added to the dataset's metadata too.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic sets</strong>: These are sets based on certain conditions that can lead to different results as the data changes. <strong>Top n</strong> or <strong>Bottom n</strong> sets are common use cases of this. For example, what percentage of the total sales came from the top 10 countries?</p>
<p>To solve this, we will create a set for the top 10 countries by sales first. Right-click <kbd>Country</kbd>, select <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Set</span>. Then, under <span class="packt_screen">Create | Set</span>, rename the set <kbd>Top 10</kbd>, and go to the <span class="packt_screen">Top</span> tab. In the <span class="packt_screen">Top</span> tab, we will define the condition for the set. Select <span class="packt_screen">By field</span>, and change the field to <span class="packt_screen">Sales</span>. The aggregation automatically changes to <span class="packt_screen">Sum</span>. Click <strong>OK</strong>. Refer to the following screenshot for the steps:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1130 image-border" src="assets/47969c20-9790-429c-ad47-2a34f3e4be65.png" style="width:61.92em;height:33.92em;"/></p>
<p>You will notice that, under the <span class="packt_screen">Sets</span> category, a new set has been created:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131 image-border" src="assets/344ef059-0b6d-44e5-9243-228ae52040d6.png" style="width:7.00em;height:3.33em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">Once you bring this to the shelf, it will show two values: <span class="packt_screen">In/Out</span>—<span class="packt_screen">In</span> includes values for all members within the set, and <span class="packt_screen">Out</span> is for all numbers not in the set. To view the percentage of sales by the top 10 countries, we will now add <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> to the graph and create a quick table calculation by right-clicking <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd>| <strong>Create Table Calculation</strong> | <strong>Percentage of Total</strong>. You should get the results shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1132 image-border" src="assets/f8d0d73e-a566-4276-b837-efe10a7cf11e.png" style="width:36.08em;height:25.42em;"/></p>
<p>This gives us the result showing 66.89% of the total sales come from just the top 10 countries. Instead of seeing the values in terms of <strong>In/Out</strong>, to see the actual set members, right-click on the set and select <span class="packt_screen">Show Members in Set</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Static Sets: </strong>These sets have fixed members. For example, in the preceding example, if instead of having the top 10 countries set using a condition, we would have selected the United States and the United Kingdom in the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab, and it would have become a static set:</p>

<p>Another way to create such a set is from the visual directly. Select the values you want to group and select <span class="packt_screen">Create | Set</span>. Once you select this, it gives you additional options to exclude such values or to add them to the <span class="packt_screen">Filter</span> shelf <span>and more</span>. An example of where this is useful is to identify outliers in data and then, using the set, exclude them from other visuals as well:</p>

<p class="mce-root">Groups are useful for categorizing data under common labels. Groups simply add another layer of labels/headers over existing data and can only be used with dimensions. Examples of grouping would be to correctly categorize data, for example, NY and New York all under a common header of New York, or to create regional groups per manager depending on their territories. </p>
<p>Creating groups is similar to creating sets. You can create a group directly from the visual by selecting the chart and then clicking on the <span><span>paper clip </span></span>icon for grouping:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1134 image-border" src="assets/33e028cd-68ad-4eaf-a89f-29a49f064e69.png" style="width:57.83em;height:16.92em;"/></p>
<p>Once you group the items, you will see <kbd>Market (group)</kbd> <span>appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> shelf. Right-click and select <strong>Edit Group</strong>. You will see the menu as follows: </span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1135 image-border" src="assets/fe24b8e0-a27e-42b2-9e3c-572dfc282937.png" style="width:39.33em;height:19.83em;"/></p>
<p>Here, you can group other members together, ungroup current members, and rename the groups as well as choose to include an <strong>Other</strong> group. As an example, let's combine <strong>Africa</strong> and <strong>EMEA</strong> by selecting both, clicking on <strong>Group</strong>, and then naming it <kbd>EMEA++</kbd>. Also, check the <strong>Include 'Other'</strong> button and click <strong>OK</strong>. Now, bring <kbd>Market</kbd> on the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> shelf after <kbd>Market(group)</kbd>. You will see the graph shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136 image-border" src="assets/026373fe-2870-454d-9460-7d8b2469a63c.png" style="width:61.33em;height:11.58em;"/></p>
<p><span><span>As you can see, the various </span></span><kbd><span><span>Market</span></span></kbd> types have been grouped together under the labels we chose in <kbd>Market(group)</kbd>.</p>
<p><span>Another way to perform grouping is to select the <span class="packt_screen">Dimension</span> the elements of which we want to group, right-click and select <strong>Create</strong> | <strong>Group</strong>. This will open the same menu as you saw when clicking on <strong>Edit Group</strong> before. </span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Hierarchies</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Hierarchies provide a good way to visualize data at a high level and then drill down to deeper details if needed. Common examples of hierarchies are date hierarchies ( <kbd>Year</kbd>, <kbd>Quarter</kbd>, <kbd>Month</kbd>, and <kbd>Day</kbd>), location hierarchies (<kbd>Country</kbd>, <kbd>State</kbd>, and <kbd>City</kbd>), or a <kbd>Product Category</kbd> and <kbd>Product Subcategory</kbd> hierarchy. To create a hierarchy, click on the dimensions you want to add to the hierarchy, for example, <kbd>Category</kbd> and <kbd>Sub-Category</kbd>, then right-click <strong>Hierarchy</strong> and select <strong>Create Hierarchy</strong>. To add to a pre-existing <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, select <strong>Add to Hierarchy</strong>: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1466 image-border" src="assets/076074b8-4326-4de5-9ea7-898907008c80.png" style="width:34.08em;height:29.08em;"/></p>
<p>Once the hierarchy is created, it can be used in the graphs easily. By using hierarchies, we eliminate the need to use multiple visuals to represent the same data. Instead of having separate graphs to show data for sales at the <kbd>Category</kbd> and then <kbd>Sub-Category</kbd> level, a hierarchy allows us to toggle between both views on the same sheet. The <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon is used to expand the hierarchy while <span class="packt_screen">–</span> is used to contract it. The following example shows how the <span>created</span><span> </span><span>hierarchy expanded:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1138 image-border" src="assets/0defbb33-242c-4583-a216-c5e68290ca1e.png" style="width:68.08em;height:41.00em;"/></p>
<p><span><span>Now that we are familiar with the various ways in which we can enhance visuals using capabilities of grouping, sets, and hierarchies, let's shift our focus on to the more visual formats that we quickly apply to enhance our visuals.</span></span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are various formatting options available for the visual in Tableau at both the worksheet level as well as the individual graph level. </p>
<p>At the worksheet level, three important cards can be displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Title</strong>: To show the title of the sheet.</li>
<li><strong>Caption</strong>: A description of what the sheet is displaying, with all of the details of the filters applied.</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: Provides a quick summary of descriptive statistics for the visual, such as the sum, average, and median.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to display any of these, by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Worksheet</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Menu</span> bar and then <span class="packt_screen">Show Title/Caption/Summary</span>.</p>
<p>At the visual level, you can display/edit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labels</strong>: Values in the text for the visual points displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Annotations</strong>: Annotations with data highlighting points, marks, or labels—these can contain what you want to display.</li>
<li><strong>Axes</strong>: The axes label names, range of values displayed, normal or logarithmic axes—to view the options for the axes, select and right-click the axes and then select edit axes. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows the labels and axes: </p>

<p><span>To add any of these, we can simply right-click on the visual and see the options available.</span></p>

<p>In this<span> chapter, we learned about the most common types of charts that can be created in Tableau and when to use which chart. This chapter also detailed how filters, sets, groups, and more can be used to enhance the visuals and perform quicker analysis. As mentioned at the start of this chapter, Tableau is a visual tool and these basic elements of understanding will go a long way in way in saving time and performing </span><span>quicker</span><span> </span><span>analysis</span> <span>for the exam, as well as for creating an effective and meaningful analysis for the future.</span></p>
<p><span>In the next chapter, we shall dive deeper into map visuals and understand more about mapping capabilities in Tableau.</span></p>
