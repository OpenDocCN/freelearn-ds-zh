- en: Hello there! **Network science** combines the power of analytics with the deep
    theoretical tools of graph theory to solve difficult problems in data analytics.
    This empowers researchers and industry engineers/data scientists to analyze data
    at scale and reframe intractable analytics problems to produce powerful insights
    into problems and predictions about system behaviors, including biological, physical,
    and social systems of interest.

    on the cutting edge of network science applications to areas of data science,
    such as transportation logistics, conversation, public health, linguistics, and
    education. By the end of your journey, you’ll be able to frame your own data problem
    within the framework of network science to derive insights and tackle difficult
    problems in your field.

    examples and code related to our work in academia and industry over the past decades,
    including work on predicting Ebola outbreaks, forecasting food price volatility,
    modeling genetic and linguistic relationships, and mining social networks for
    insights into social tie formation. As the world faces food shortages, public
    health crises, economic inequality, supply chain breakdowns, and environmental
    crises, network science will play an important role in big data analytics for
    social good.

- en: This book is for you if you are working with data. To get the most out of the
    book, you should have some familiarity with Python, particularly the `pandas`
    and `numpy` packages. In addition, some familiarity with data analytics is assumed,
    though the network science tools and problems we tackle are built from scratch
    for readers without a background in those problems or methods.

- en: Network science has a rich history in many scientific disciplines, including
    epidemiology, biomedical engineering, sociology, genetics, environmental science,
    particle physics, computer science, and economics. Its foundations in graph theory
    influence research in many areas of pure and applied mathematics as well. Anyone
    in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics can benefit
    from network science’s toolset and approach to problem-solving.

    the theoretical concept of a network and provides several examples of networks
    in real-world applications, including work with random graphs. We’ll also get
    started with Python’s igraph and NetworkX packages.'

    with NetworkX and igraph*, builds on [*Chapter 1*](B21087_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016)
    by providing three examples of real-world data that can be formulated as network
    data and showing how to convert data into network form in Python. We’ll introduce
    problems involving spatial data, temporal data, and spatiotemporal data and explore
    how network science can solve these problems by converting the data into network
    form.'

    two real-world projects using demography data from the developing world to understand
    network structures and capacity for information/infectious disease spread. We’ll
    consider the demographic characteristics and network properties of a friend group
    to see how both types of information can influence disease spread.'

    packages (such as NumPy and scikit-learn) and Python syntax. We assume some knowledge
    of basic analytics tasks such as summary statistics and working with different
    types of data in Python with either `numpy` or `pandas`. Scripts are written for
    each chapter, with later scripts often depending on earlier scripts in the chapter
    to build knowledge. Other concepts in Python and in analytics will be introduced
    conceptually and then with Python code examples.
