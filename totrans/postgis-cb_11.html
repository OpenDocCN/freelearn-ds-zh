<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding PostGIS layers – QGIS</li>
<li>Using the Database Manager plugin – QGIS</li>
<li>Adding PostGIS layers – OpenJUMP GIS</li>
<li>Running database queries – OpenJUMP GIS</li>
<li>Adding PostGIS layers – gvSIG</li>
<li>Adding PostGIS layers – uDig</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>At a minimum, desktop GIS programs allow you to visualize data from a PostGIS database. This relationship gets more interesting with the ability to edit and manipulate data outside of the database and in a dynamic <em>play</em> environment.</p>
<p>Make a change, see a change! For this reason, visualizing the data stored in PostGIS is often critical for effective spatial database management—or at least as a now-and-again sanity check. This chapter will demonstrate both dynamic and static relationships between your database and desktop clients.</p>
<p>Regardless of your experience level or role in the geospatial community, you should find at least one of the four GIS programs serviceable as a potential intermediate staging environment between your PostGIS database and end product.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will connect to PostGIS using the following desktop GIS programs: <strong>QGIS</strong>, <strong>OpenJUMP GIS</strong>, <strong>gvSIG</strong>, and <strong>uDig</strong>.</p>
<p>Once connected to PostGIS, extra emphasis will be placed on some of the more sophisticated functionalities offered by <kbd>QGIS</kbd> and <kbd>OpenJUMP GIS</kbd> using the <strong>Database Manager</strong> (<strong>DB Manager</strong>) plugin and data store queries, respectively.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding PostGIS layers – QGIS</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, we will establish a connection to our PostGIS database in order to add a table as a layer in <strong>QGIS</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Quantum GIS</strong>). Viewing tables as layers is great for creating maps or simply working on a copy of the database outside the database.</p>
<p>Please navigate to the following site to install the latest version LTR of QGIS (2.18 – Las Palmas at the time of writing):</p>
<p><a href="http://qgis.org/en/site/">http://qgis.org/en/site/</a></p>
<p>On this page, click on Download Now and you will be able to choose a suitable operating system and the relevant settings. QGIS is available for Android, Linux, macOS X, and Windows. You might also be inclined to click on Discover QGIS to get an overview of basic information about the program along with features, screenshots, and case studies.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To begin, create the schema for this chapter as <kbd>chp11</kbd>; then, download data from the U.S. Census Bureau's FTP site:</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2012/EDGES/tl_2012_39035_edges.zip">http://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2012/EDGES/tl_2012_39035_edges.zip</a></p>
<p>The shapefile is <kbd>All Lines</kbd> for Cuyahoga county in Ohio, which consist of roads and streams among other line features.</p>
<p>Extract the ZIP file to your working directory and then load it into your database using <kbd>shp2pgsql</kbd>. Be sure to specify the spatial reference system, EPSG/SRID: 4269. When in doubt about using projections, use the service provided by the folks at OpenGeo at the following website:<br/>
<a href="http://prj2epsg.org/search">http://prj2epsg.org/search</a></p>
<p>Use the following command to generate the SQL to load the shapefile in a table of the <kbd>chp11</kbd> schema:</p>
<pre><strong>shp2pgsql -s 4269 -W LATIN1 -g the_geom -I tl_2012_39035_edges.shp chp11.tl_2012_39035_edges &gt; tl_2012_39035_edges.sql</strong></pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now it's time to give the data we downloaded a look using QGIS. We must first create a connection to the database in order to access the table. Get connected and add the table as a layer by following the ensuing steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Add PostGIS Layers icon:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b26071bf-5890-4d16-8b5b-b3b19495070a.png" style="width:12.17em;height:11.33em;"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Click on the New button below the Connections drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a new PostGIS connection. After the Add PostGIS Table(s) window opens, create a name for the connection and fill in a few parameters for your database, including Host, Port, Database, Username, and Password:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/831f624c-973a-413d-baf5-803c1d3e7aca.png" style="width:28.67em;height:39.92em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once you have entered all of the pertinent information for your database, click on the Test Connection button to verify that the connection is successful. If the connection is not successful, double-check for typos and errors. Additionally, make sure you are attempting to connect to a PostGIS-enabled database.</li>
<li>If the connection is successful, go ahead and check the Save Username and Save Password checkboxes. This will prevent you from having to enter your login information multiple times throughout the exercise.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Click on OK at the bottom of the menu to apply the connection settings. Now you can connect!</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Make sure the name of your PostGIS connection appears in the drop-down menu and then click on the Connect button. If you choose not to store your username and password, you will be asked to submit this information every time you try to access the database.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Once connected, all schemas within the database will be shown and the tables will be made visible by expanding the target schema.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Select the table(s) to be added as a layer by simply clicking on the table name or anywhere along its row. Selection(s) will be highlighted in blue. To deselect a table, click on it a second time and it will no longer be highlighted. Select the <kbd>tl_2012_39035_edges</kbd> table that was downloaded at the beginning of the chapter and click on the Add button, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/6a7a27fd-eafb-4886-9a54-78dc4ad9434c.png" style="width:51.83em;height:33.42em;"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>A subset of the table can also be added as a layer. This is accomplished by double-clicking on the desired table name.</li>
<li>The Query Builder window will open, which aids in creating simple SQL <kbd>WHERE</kbd> clause statements. Add the roads by selecting the records where <kbd>roadflg = Y</kbd>. This can be done by typing a query or using the buttons within Query Builder:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/c48c8e0a-9196-4fc7-8869-33b2db5b8a1f.png" style="width:46.50em;height:34.17em;"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>Click on the OK button followed by the Add button. A subset of the table is now loaded into QGIS as a layer. The layer is strictly a static, temporary copy of your database. You can make whatever changes you like to the layer and not affect the database table.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The same holds true the other way around. Changes to the table in the database will have no effect on the layer in QGIS.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If needed, you can save the temporary layer in a variety of formats, such as DXF, GeoJSON, KML, or SHP. Simply right-click on the layer name in the Layers panel and click on Save As. This will then create a file, which you can recall at a later time or share with others.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You may also use the QGIS Browser Panel to navigate through the now connected PostGIS database and list the schemas and tables. This panel allows you to double-click to add spatial layers to the current project, providing a better user experience not only of connected databases, but on any directory of your machine:</p>
<div><img src="img/db0b2deb-982a-4532-bca1-d8b3863eb625.png" style="width:20.08em;height:24.67em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have added a PostGIS layer into QGIS using the built-in Add PostGIS Table GUI. This was achieved by creating a new connection and entering your database parameters.</p>
<p>Any number of database connections can be set up simultaneously. If working with multiple databases is more common for your workflows, saving all of the connections into one XML file (see the tip in the preceding section) would save time and energy when returning to these projects in QGIS.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using the Database Manager plugin – QGIS</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Database Manager</strong> (<strong>DB Manager</strong>) allows for a more sophisticated relationship with PostGIS by allowing users to interact with the database in a variety of ways. The plugin mimics some of the core functionality of pgAdmin with the added benefit of data visualization.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will use DB Manager to create, modify, and delete items within the database and then tinker with the SQL window. By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the DB Manager menu</li>
<li>Create, modify, and delete database schemas and tables</li>
<li>Run SQL queries to add new QGIS layers or create new tables in the database</li>
</ul>
<p>QGIS needs to be installed for this recipe. Please refer to the first recipe in this chapter for information on where to download the installer.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's make sure the plugin is enabled and connected to the database.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Plugins menu located on the QGIS menu bar and select Manage and Install Plugins from the drop-down menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/626a2bfb-e4c1-4f20-9def-3f62101c2c0d.png" style="width:17.17em;height:7.50em;"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>The QGIS Plugin Manager window will open. Search for DB Manager in the list of plugins and make sure it is checked (enabled), as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/ed24d00a-75b3-4bb7-97b4-235340cfbcad.png" style="width:47.83em;height:37.00em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now that DB Manager is enabled, let us open the plugin and check the status of the database connection. Open DB Manager by navigating to Database | DB Manager from the QGIS menu bar, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b911de78-2e8c-4c98-97a3-473be68c91d6.png" style="width:35.17em;height:5.42em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Expand the PostGIS directory within the Tree window of DB Manager. The PostGIS connection created in the last recipe will appear. Expand the connection to view your schema(s) and table(s). You will be asked for a username and password if you opted not to save your credentials.<br/>
On the Info tab above the main window, you can view information about the data, such as spatial reference, geometry type, field names, field types, and much more, as in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/92bc79fe-2f35-44e1-876b-ba67f076a342.png" style="width:49.42em;height:35.50em;"/></div>
<p>A PostGIS connection is not in place if you are unable to expand the PostGIS menu. If you need to establish a connection, refer to <em>steps 1</em> to <em>4</em> in the <em>Adding </em><em>PostGIS </em><em>layers – QGIS</em> recipe. The connection must be established before using DB Manager.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Navigate to the DB Manager menu and carry out the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <kbd>tl_2012_39035_edges</kbd> table in the Tree window.</li>
<li>Next, click on the Table tab to view the actual data table, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b3ad86db-2f95-47d5-9047-9a16165d967f.png" style="width:53.42em;height:38.33em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>The final tab, Preview, is for visualizing the data, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/4cdf1aec-89e7-4189-8cb5-079dc27871f8.png" style="width:51.67em;height:33.92em;"/></div>
<p>To create, modify, and delete database schemas and tables, follow the ensuing steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, create a new schema in the database to store data for this chapter. Select Schema | Create schema from the menu bar, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/eafbf5f7-0ea6-4509-9f66-d2c7f33f8bb5.png" style="width:23.08em;height:6.25em;"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Enter <kbd>new_schema</kbd> as the schema name and then click on OK. If you do not see the <kbd>new_schema</kbd> in the list, you may need to select the database connection in the Tree window and click on the Refresh button or press <em>F5</em> (see the following screenshot):</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/af0a05bd-3fc5-406e-8799-0f978720e04f.png" style="width:49.58em;height:18.33em;"/></div>
<div><ol start="3">
<li>Your new, empty schema will now be visible in the Tree window:</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div><img src="img/e1de2df4-8281-44ee-b186-00bd860f1cc0.png" style="width:12.50em;height:22.58em;"/></div>
<p>Now let's continue to work with our chp11 schema containing the <kbd>tl_2012_39035_edges</kbd> table. Let's modify the table name to something more generic. How about <kbd>lines</kbd>? You can change the table name by clicking on the table in the Tree window. As soon as the text is highlighted and the cursor flashes, you can delete the existing name and enter the new name, <kbd>lines</kbd>.</p>
<p>Right now, our <kbd>lines</kbd> table's data is using degrees as the unit of measurement for its current projection (<em>EPSG: 4269</em>). Let's add a new geometry column using EPSG: 3734, which is a State Plane Coordinate system that measures projections in feet. To run SQL queries, follow the ensuing steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the SQL window button in the DB Manager or press <em>F2</em>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/04652e6b-8dfe-4956-8172-ff3b8c54486e.png" style="width:17.33em;height:7.08em;"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Copy the following query into the SQL window and then click on Execute:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      <strong>SELECT AddGeometryColumn('chp11', 'lines','geom_sp',3734,<br/>                               'MULTILINESTRING', 2);</strong>
      <strong>UPDATE "chp11".lines </strong>
      <strong>SET geom_sp = ST_Transform(the_geom,3734);</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The query creates a new geometry column named <kbd>geom_sp</kbd> and then updates the geometry information by transforming the original geometry (<kbd>geom</kbd>) from EPSG 4269 to 3734, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/d2b1a29e-7fb7-40c7-9209-0d0592283342.png" style="width:49.50em;height:19.42em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Refresh the <kbd>chp11</kbd> schema and you'll notice that the table in the database now has two geometry columns that are treated independently in the Tree window:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/03963bf6-a3ae-4ad9-bdb6-9cebb91af65c.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The preceding screenshot shows the original geometry. The following screenshot shows the created geometry:</p>
<div><img src="img/512da5fb-a351-433f-8031-a1c2aa6cb010.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>For our next query, let us take a subset of the <kbd>lines</kbd> table. Similar to what we did in the preceding section, we will only look at the data about roads. However, this time, we can limit the columns that we want to load with the layer, as well as perform more complicated spatial queries. We'll apply a buffer of 10 feet using the new geometry column (<kbd>geom_sp</kbd>) by executing the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      <strong>SELECT gid, ST_Buffer(geom_sp, 10) AS geom, fullname, roadflg <br/>      FROM "chp11".lines WHERE roadflg = 'Y'</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Check the Load as new layer checkbox and then select gid as the unique ID and geom as the geometry. Create a name for the layer and then click on Load Now!, and what you'll see is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/afd51f5d-8b22-476e-a114-b635509c5f7c.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The query adds the result in QGIS as a temporary layer.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now let us modify the query to create a table in the database, rather than load the query as a layer, by executing the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      <strong>CREATE TABLE "chp11".roads_buffer_sp AS SELECT gid, <br/>      ST_Buffer(geom_sp, 10) AS geom, fullname, roadflg <br/>      FROM "chp11".lines WHERE roadflg = 'Y'</strong></pre>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Connecting to a PostGIS database (see the <em>Adding PostGIS layers – QGIS</em> recipe in this chapter) allows you to utilize the DB Manager plugin. Once DB Manager was enabled, we were able to toggle between the Info, Table, and Preview tabs to efficiently view metadata, tabular data, and data visualization.</p>
<p>Next, we made changes to the database through the query window, running on the table lines of schema <kbd>chp11</kbd> in order to transform the projection. Note the autocomplete feature in the SQL Window, which makes writing queries a breeze.</p>
<p>Changes to the database were made visible in DB Manager by refreshing the database connection.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We added a PostGIS layer in OpenJUMP using the Open Data Store Layer menu. This was achieved after creating a new connection and entering our database parameters.</p>
<p>In the example, census data was added which included the boundary of Cuyahoga county. Part of the boundary advances into Lake Erie to the International Boundary with Canada. While technically correct, the water boundary is typically not used for practical mapping purposes. In this case, it's easy to visualize which data needs to be removed.</p>
<p>OpenJUMP allows us to easily see and delete records that should be deleted from the table. The selected lines were deleted, and the table was saved to the database.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Running database queries – OpenJUMP GIS</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Executing ad hoc queries in OpenJUMP is simple and offers a couple of unique features. Queries can be run on specific data selections, allowing for the manual control of the queried area without considering the attribution. Similarly, temporary fences (areas) can be drawn on the fly and the geometry of the surface can be used in queries. In this recipe, we will explore each of those cases.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Refer to the preceding recipe if you need to install OpenJUMP or require assistance connecting to a database.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Carry out the following steps to run the data store query:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Navigate to File | Run Datastore Query. Choose the PostGIS connection from the Connection drop-down menu or use the Connection Manager utility if you are not linked to the database.</li>
<li>We'll create and name a polygon layer of the main streams in the region by executing the following query:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      <strong>SELECT gid, ST_BUFFER("chp11".lines.geom_sp, 75) <br/>      AS the_geom, fullname <br/>      FROM "chp11".lines WHERE fullname &lt;&gt; '' </strong><strong>AND hydroflg = 'Y'</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The preceding query is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/36774018-4013-4df8-9048-67eff2866ea8.png" style="width:49.42em;height:17.50em;"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The preceding query selects the lines on the map that represent hydrology units such as <kbd>"hydroflg" = 'Y'</kbd> and streams. The selected stream lines (which use the State Plane geometry) are buffered by 75 feet, which should yield a result like that shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/4c7f1a46-5c72-4472-a90f-ac11ae8cf4b5.png" style="width:32.33em;height:25.75em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>The <kbd>ST_Buffer</kbd> function uses the units of the data projection for buffering. So, if your data still has the original spatial reference <em>EPSG: 4269</em>, you will be buffering the lines by 75 degrees, and this will lead to very strange results indeed! Modify the following SQL query to transform your geometry:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      <strong>SELECT AddGeometryColumn('chp11', 'lines','geom_sp',3734,<br/>                               'MULTILINESTRING', 2);</strong>
      <strong>UPDATE "chp11".lines SET geom_sp = ST_Transform(geom,3734);</strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>You'll then want to go back to <em>step 2</em> in order to create the buffer measured in feet.</li>
<li>Next, pan and zoom on the map and find two, separate polygons that are near each other.</li>
<li>Select the Fence icon on the main menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/6c0f9e38-2199-4436-8527-70881ad927c2.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Draw a connection (overlapping a connection is fine) between the two unconnected polygons using the Fence tool. Click once on the Fence button to create a vertex and double-click on it once your polygon is complete.</li>
<li>Switch over to the Select Features Tool, as shown in the following screenshot, and select the polygons that you drew on either side of the Fence bridge; select multiple features by holding down the <em>Shift</em> key:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/ead4d152-0d8a-460b-b7b8-3e5bbbb2d13c.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now have a fence junction between the selected polygons. You should see something similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/079369ca-f78e-4fc4-975d-a8aa575db4c2.png" style="width:40.25em;height:18.58em;"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Navigate to File | Run Datastore Query again.</li>
<li>This time, we will utilize the buttons to the right-hand side of the window to connect.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Run <kbd>ST_UNION</kbd> on the selection and fence together so that the gap is filled. We do this with the following query:</p>
<pre>      <strong>SELECT ST_UNION(geom1, geom2) AS geom</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Use the Selection and Fence buttons in place of <kbd>geom1</kbd> and <kbd>geom2</kbd> so that your query looks as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<ol start="11">
<li>Click on OK and view the query result by turning off the Main Streams and Fence layers, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<p>We added a buffered subset of a PostGIS layer in OpenJUMP using the Run Datastore Query menu. We took lines from a database table and converted them to polygons to view them in OpenJUMP.</p>
<p>We then manually selected an area of interest that had two representative stream polygons disjointed from one another, the idea being that the streams would be, or are, connected in a natural state.</p>
<p>The Fence tool was used to draw a freehand polygon between the streams. A <kbd>union</kbd> query was then performed to combine the two stream polygons and the fences. Fences allow us to create temporary tables for use in spatial queries executed against a database table.</p>
