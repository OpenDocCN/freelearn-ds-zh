    law of gravitation or the trajectory of planets around the sun. However, a more
    accurate description of Nature, especially chemistry, can be found via quantum
    physics, which encapsulates the postulates of **quantum mechanics**, the foundation
    of quantum chemistry, and quantum computing. To gain the next level of understanding
    of chemistry predictions, quantum chemistry algorithms need to be designed to
    achieve a high level of accuracy. It is not enough to simply program approximate
    methods and have a quantum computer run them to achieve higher accuracy than the

    century is important in order to understand how the postulates of quantum mechanics
    were discovered. It will also help you grasp the major approximations that have

    community for just over a century. The most notable controversy of quantum mechanics
    is that it gave rise to the atomic bomb during World War II. Robert J. Oppenheimer

    of one of the most widely used and influential approximation to date: the **Born-Oppenheimer

    in depth in [*Chapter 6*](B18268_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228)*, Beyond Born-Oppenheimer*.
