- en: Armed with powerful tools, ArcGIS Pro 2 is Esri's newest desktop GIS application
    that uses the modern ribbon interface and a 64-bit processor to make using GIS
    faster and more efficient. This second edition of *Learning ArcGIS Pro* will show
    you how you can use this powerful desktop GIS application to create maps, perform
    spatial analysis, and maintain data.

    and hardware prerequisites. You'll then be introduced to the concept of named
    user licensing and learn how to navigate the new ribbon interface to leverage
    the power of ArcGIS Pro to manage geospatial data. Once you've got to grips with
    the new interface, you'll build your first GIS project and learn how to use the
    different project resources.

    and managing the symbology and labeling. You'll also discover how to use the analysis
    tool to visualize geospatial data. In later chapters, you’ll be introduced to
    Arcade, the new lightweight expression language for ArcGIS, and then advance to
    creating complex labels using Arcade expressions.

    and be able to share ArcGIS Pro maps, projects, and data with other GIS community
    members. This book also explores the most widely used geoprocessing tools for
    performing spatial analysis and explains how to create tasks based oncommon workflows
    to standardize processes. You will also learn how to automate processes using
    ModelBuilder and Python scripts.

    book or series for the area. ArcGIS Pro has built-in functionality for creating
    these map books, and this chapter will show you how.'
