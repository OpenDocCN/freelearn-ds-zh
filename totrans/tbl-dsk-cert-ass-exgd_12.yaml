    to put everything together. The views you have created are often a means for a
    user to identify critical information. Dashboards allow us to combine multiple
    views onto a single page. By presenting multiple views of data on a single page,
    we are able to communicate information more efficiently.

    You need to present the right combination of views without overwhelming the user.
    You also need to construct the dashboard in such a way that it is easy for users
    to use and understand. This chapter will walk you through features and best practices
    that will help you build actionable and informative dashboards. In this final
    chapter, we will discuss the following topics:'

- en: A dashboard is a visual display of important information on a single page. It
    usually consists of multiple related components that allows users to track changes
    or get information. Dashboards are embedded with controls that allow users to
    filter information. These filters often control multiple sheets on the dashboard.
    This allows users to view various related components without having to switch
    screens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Filters are how users interact with the views in a dashboard – they allow users
    to answer questions. What distinguishes dashboards from reports is that dashboards
    are predominantly visual. While they can contain tabular summaries, they should
    emphasize visuals. There have been many studies that describe the importance of
    data visualization. The main findings are that data visualizations excel at revealing
    patterns, outliers, trends, and correlations that can't easily be found when looking
    at a table of numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of a dashboard as how you choose to present your sheets. A dashboard
    should be able to communicate key findings in the data. The visualizations that
    make up a dashboard are interactive via filters and controls. Effective information
    design is as much art as science. There is no one-size-fits-all method or technique
    to create robust and useful dashboards.

    amount of work to create sheets. The sheets are the backbone of the dashboard;
    care must not only be taken in developing individual sheets but also how they
    are presented together in the dashboard. In this section, we will discuss best
    practices for effective dashboard design. While these tips are not exhaustive,
    they will provide you with a good starting point on your path to developing powerful
    dashboards.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important item to consider before building any solution is to know
    the purpose. What questions will the dashboard answer? Having a list of specific
    questions to answer gives you a clear purpose. You should always have a have a
    clearly defined purpose when developing dashboards. Knowing the purpose forces
    you to address the needs of the viewers. In business, knowing the purpose of the
    dashboard usually involves understanding what **key performance indicators** (**KPIs**)
    users are interested in.

- en: By knowing your audience and understanding their needs, you will be able to
    develop an actionable dashboard that users will want to use. At the end of the
    day, dashboards need to answer questions, keep people informed, and be easy to
    use. If these three components are not met, then everyone loses.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Limit the number of sheets used – you do not want to overwhelm users with sheets
    and clutter. A dashboard should not be hard to use (or understand). By limiting
    the number of sheets used in a dashboard, you limit the elements a user needs
    to pay attention to. One of the most common contributors to bad dashboard design
    is the inclusion of too many sheets. As a general rule, you should use no more
    than three visualizations in a dashboard.
  prefs: []

- en: Presenting multiple views allows you to include more information and finer details.
    More information also means that users can get lost in what is important and what
    is not. Thinking about the big picture when designing your dashboard can help
    mitigate this.

    large amount of extra information depending on the type of visual. Once again,
    it is important to know your audience. Try to make it easy for them to access
    the information they are looking for, even if it means simplifying your design.
    Design with your audience in mind. A good dashboard is one that people use. People
    are more likely to use simple dashboards as opposed to complex dashboards.

    and efficiently. One of the biggest obstacles you will face is how to present
    the various sheets in your workbook together in one dashboard in a manner that
    is seamless. Remember that you are trying to present a large amount of data in
    a limited space. You need to think about the relationship between sheets as you
    are working toward your end goal. The story you tell is dependent on what the
    audience wants and needs to see.

    options. The Layout pane gives you finer control of how sheets and objects are
    formatted in the dashboard. The Layout pane allows you to precisely position and

    story page will open. A story is a collection of visualizations presented in an
    ordered format. A story is similar to a PowerPoint presentation. The story comprises
    a series of story points. The following screenshot shows a blank story page:'

    two tabs are distinct panes – Story and Layout. The layout of the Story page is
    similar to that of the dashboard page. The Story pane allows you to place sheets
    and objects in the story. It is also where you set screen-sizing options. The
    Layout pane gives you finer control of how to navigate through the story. We will
    discuss both of these panes in the following section.

    data you present and how you present the data is a major component of storytelling.
    You are leading your viewers to a conclusion that should be supported with data.
    As with dashboards, we believe that you should have a plan or an outline before
    developing. Sitting down and crafting a narrative will help make your story better.

    point is a single slide. Stories are made of multiple story points in a sequence
    that conveys a point or message. The New story point section has two buttons – Blank
    and Duplicate. The Blank button creates a new story point for you to work on while
    the Duplicate button creates a copy of the current story point. In the preceding
    screenshot, there is only one story point – story points are represented by gray
    boxes in the middle of the pane under the story title. In the following screenshot,
    a blank story point was created – notice how there are now two gray boxes under

    to create dashboards and stories. You now have all the pieces necessary to create
    and share a professional view of the story you wish to tell. As we come to the
    end of our journey, we will close with our final thoughts on making compelling
    data visualizations.

- en: Creating dashboards and stories is a combination of art and science. The visualizations
    you develop are only as good as the underlying data. If the data is not accurate
    then the solution is, at best, useless and, at worst, harmful. It is more beneficial
    for a user to have no information as opposed to incorrect information that they
    are led to believe is accurate. The message of the visualization needs to be true.
    Good visualizations enhance the message. They allow users to identify trends,
    spot patterns, and understand information more efficiently.

    make better sense of your data. We hope that you have learned about the key features
    of Tableau and how to use them to take full advantage of your data. While the
    concepts presented in this book are not exhaustive, they are enough to help you
    pass the Tableau Desktop Certified exam. The best way to get better at Tableau
    is to start using it. You now have a solid foundation on which to build. Our final
    advice to you is to find questions that you wish to answer, get the data to do
    so, and use the methods you have learned in this book to help you create accurate,
    intuitive, and visually stunning reporting solutions.
