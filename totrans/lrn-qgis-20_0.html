This book aims to introduce you to QGIS 2 and how to perform core geospatial tasks using this popular open source GIS. It takes you through five chapters, from QGIS installation and setup in the first chapter, to the essentials of viewing spatial data in the second chapter. The third chapter covers data creation and editing, followed by the fourth chapter, which offers an introduction to performing spatial analysis in QGIS. In the final chapter, you will learn how to create great maps and how to prepare them for print.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with QGIS">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with QGIS</em></span>, covers the installation and configuration of QGIS. We will also get to know the user interface and how to customize it. By the end of this chapter, you will have QGIS running on your machine and be ready to start with the tutorials.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Viewing Spatial Data">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Viewing Spatial Data</em></span>, covers how to view spatial data from different data sources. QGIS supports many file and database formats as well as OGC web services. We will first see how we can load layers from these different data sources. Then, we will look into the basics of styling both vector and raster layers and will create our first map. We will finish this chapter with an example for loading background maps from online services.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Data Creation and Editing">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Data Creation and Editing</em></span>, covers the creation of new vector layers. Then, we will cover how to select features and take measurements before we continue with editing feature geometries and attributes. We will then reproject vector and raster data and learn how to convert between different file formats before we end this chapter with joining data from text files and spreadsheets to our spatial data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Spatial Analysis">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Spatial Analysis</em></span>, covers raster processing and analysis tasks such as clipping and terrain analysis. Then, we cover converting between raster and vector formats before we continue with common vector geoprocessing tasks such as generating heatmaps and calculating area shares within a region. Finally, we will finish the chapter with an exercise in automating a geoprocessing workflow using the QGIS Processing modeler.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Creating Great Maps">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Creating Great Maps</em></span>, covers important features that enable us to create great maps. We will go into advanced vector styling, building on what we learned in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Viewing Spatial Data">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Viewing Spatial Data</em></span>. Then, we will cover labeling using examples of labeling point locations as well as creating more advanced road labels with road shield graphics. We will also cover how to tweak labels manually. Finally, we will get to know the print composer and how to use it to create printable maps and map books.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for users, developers, and consultants who know the basic functions and processes of GIS, but want to know how to use QGIS to achieve the results they are used to from other GIS. This book is not intended to be a GIS textbook. The reader is expected to be comfortable with core GIS concepts.</p></div>
