			<p>While a huge amount of data is readily available to us, it is not useful in its raw form. For data to be meaningful, it must be curated and refined. </p>
			<p>If you<a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>'re a beginner, then <em class="italic">The Data Wrangling Workshop, Second Edition</em> will help to break down the process for you. You'll start with the basics and build your knowledge, progressing from the core aspects behind data wrangling, to using the most popular tools and techniques.</p>
			<p>This book starts by showing you how to work with data structures using Python. Through examples and activities, you'll understand why you should stay away from traditional methods of data cleaning used in other languages and take advantage of the specialized pre-built routines in Python. Later, you'll learn how to use the same Python backend to extract and transform data from an array of sources, including the internet, large database vaults, and Excel financial tables. To help you prepare for more challenging scenarios, the book teaches you how to handle missing or incorrect data, and reformat it based on the requirements from your downstream analytics tool.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have developed a solid understanding of how to perform data wrangling with Python, and learned several techniques and best practices to extract, clean, transform, and format your data efficiently, from a diverse array of sources.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Audience</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">The Data Wrangling Workshop, Second Edition</em> is designed for developers, data analysts, and business analysts who are looking to pursue a career as a full-fledged data scientist or analytics expert. Although this book is for beginners who want to start data wrangling, prior working knowledge of the Python programming language is necessary to easily grasp the concepts covered here.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Conventions</h2>
			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "This will return the value associated with it – <strong class="source-inline">["list_element1", 34]</strong>".</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">list_1 = []</p>
			<p class="source-code">    for x in range(0, 10):</p>
			<p class="source-code">    list_1.append(x)</p>
			<p class="source-code">list_1</p>
			<p>Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Click <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> and choose <strong class="source-inline">Python 3</strong>."</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Code Presentation</h2>
			<p>Lines of code that span multiple lines are split using a backslash ( <strong class="source-inline">\</strong> ). When the code is executed, Python will ignore the backslash, and treat the code on the next line as a direct continuation of the current line.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=5, verbose=1, \</p>
			<p class="source-code">                    validation_split=0.2, shuffle=False)</p>
			<p>Comments are added into code to help explain specific bits of logic. Single-line comments are denoted using the <strong class="source-inline">#</strong> symbol, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code"># Print the sizes of the dataset</p>
			<p class="source-code">print("Number of Examples in the Dataset = ", X.shape[0])</p>
			<p class="source-code">print("Number of Features for each example = ", X.shape[1])</p>
			<p>Multi-line comments are enclosed by triple quotes, as shown below:</p>
			<p class="source-code">"""</p>
			<p class="source-code">Define a seed for the random number generator to ensure the </p>
			<p class="source-code">result will be reproducible</p>
			<p class="source-code">"""</p>
			<p class="source-code">seed = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">np.random.seed(seed)</p>
			<p class="source-code">random.set_seed(seed)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Setting up Your Environment</h2>
			<p>Before we explore the book in detail, we need to set up specific software and tools. In the following section, we shall see how to do that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Installing Python</h2>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Installing Python on Windows</h3>
			<p>To install Python on Windows, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Find your desired version of Python on the official installation page at <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows">https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows</a>.</li>
				<li>Ensure that you select Python 3.7 on the download page.</li>
				<li>Ensure that you install the correct architecture for your computer system, that is, either 32-bit or 64-bit. You can find out this information in the <strong class="source-inline">System Properties</strong> window of your OS.</li>
				<li>After you have downloaded the installer, simply double-click the file and follow the user-friendly prompts onscreen.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Installing Python on Linux</h3>
			<p>To install Python on Linux, you have a couple of options. Here is one option:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the command line and verify that <strong class="source-inline">Python 3</strong> is not already installed by running <strong class="source-inline">python3 --version</strong>.</li>
				<li>To install Python 3, run this:<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get update</p><p class="source-code">sudo apt-get install python3.7</p></li>
				<li>If you encounter problems, there are numerous sources online that can help you troubleshoot the issue.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Alternatively, install Anaconda Linux by downloading the installer from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux">https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux</a> and following the instructions.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Installing Python on MacOS</h3>
			<p>Similar to the case with Linux, you have a couple of methods for installing Python on a Mac. To install Python on macOS X, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Terminal for Mac by pressing <em class="italic">CMD</em> + <em class="italic">Spacebar</em>, type <strong class="source-inline">terminal</strong> in the open search box, and hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>.</li>
				<li>Install Xcode through the command line by running <strong class="source-inline">xcode-select –install</strong>.</li>
				<li>The easiest way to install Python 3 is using Homebrew, which is installed through the command line by running <strong class="source-inline">ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</strong>.</li>
				<li>Add Homebrew to your <strong class="source-inline">$PATH</strong> environment variable. Open your profile in the command line by running <strong class="source-inline">sudo nano ~/.profile</strong> and inserting <strong class="source-inline">export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"</strong> at the bottom.</li>
				<li>The final step is to install Python. In the command line, run <strong class="source-inline">brew install python</strong>.</li>
				<li>You can also install Python via the Anaconda installer available from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos">https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Installing Libraries</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">pip</strong> comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Once Anaconda is installed on your machine, all the required libraries can be installed using <strong class="source-inline">pip</strong>, for example, <strong class="source-inline">pip install numpy</strong>. Alternatively, you can install all the required libraries using <strong class="source-inline">pip install –r requirements.txt</strong>. You can find the <strong class="source-inline">requirements.txt</strong> file at <a href="https://packt.live/30UUshh">https://packt.live/30UUshh</a>.</p>
			<p>The exercises and activities will be executed in Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter is a Python library and can be installed in the same way as the other Python libraries – that is, with <strong class="source-inline">pip install jupyter</strong>, but fortunately, it comes pre-installed with Anaconda. To open a notebook, simply run the command <strong class="source-inline">jupyter notebook</strong> in the Terminal or Command Prompt.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Project Jupyter</h2>
			<p>Project Jupyter is open source, free software that gives you the ability to run code written in Python and some other languages interactively from a special notebook, similar to a browser interface. It was born in 2014 from the IPython project and has since become the default choice for the entire data science workforce.</p>
			<p>Once you are running the Jupyter server, click <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> and choose <strong class="source-inline">Python 3</strong>. A new browser tab will open with a new and empty notebook. Rename the Jupyter file:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.1: Jupyter server interface</p>
			<p>The main building blocks of Jupyter notebooks are cells. There are two types of cells: <strong class="source-inline">In</strong> (short for input) and <strong class="source-inline">Out</strong> (short for output). You can write code, normal text, and Markdown in <strong class="source-inline">In</strong> cells, press <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">Enter</em> (or <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">Return</em>), and the code written in that particular <strong class="source-inline">In</strong> cell will be executed. The result will be shown in an <strong class="source-inline">Out</strong> cell, and you will land in a new <strong class="source-inline">In</strong> cell, ready for the next block of code. Once you get used to this interface, you will slowly discover the power and flexibility it offers.</p>
			<p>When you start a new cell, by default, it is assumed that you will write code in it. However, if you want to write text, then you have to change the type. You can do that using the following sequence of keys: <em class="italic">Escape</em> -&gt; <em class="italic">m</em> -&gt; <em class="italic">Enter</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B15780_00_02.jpg" alt="Figure 0.2: Jupyter notebook" width="1422" height="762"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.2: Jupyter notebook</p>
			<p>When you are done with writing the text, execute it using <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">Enter</em>. Unlike the code cells, the result of the compiled Markdown will be shown in the same place as the <strong class="source-inline">In</strong> cell.</p>
			<p>To have a <em class="italic">cheat sheet</em> of all the handy key shortcuts in Jupyter Notebook, you can bookmark this Gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kidpixo/f4318f8c8143adee5b40">https://gist.github.com/kidpixo/f4318f8c8143adee5b40</a>. With this basic introduction and the image ready to be used, we are ready to embark on the exciting and enlightening journey.</p>
