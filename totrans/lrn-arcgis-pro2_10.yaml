    elected officials is *W**hen will our GIS be done?* The honest answer is *never*.
    Much of the information that we store in a **Geographic Information System** (**GIS**)
    is constantly changing – new roads are built, parcels are split and sold, new
    sewer lines are installed, and more. All of these changes need to be incorporated
    into our GIS databases. To do this, you must be able to edit your GIS data.

    You can add new features or modify existing ones. You can also edit the structure

    new attribute fields, create new tables, add domains, and more. It also supports
    the editing of both 2D and 3D data.'

    capabilities of ArcGIS Pro. Most of the tools that were available in the older
    **ArcMap** application are now included in ArcGIS Pro. However, there are still
    a few data types, such as personal geodatabases and geometric networks, that cannot
    be edited with ArcGIS Pro. These most likely will never be supported in ArcGIS
    Pro. The old **ArcMap Parcel Fabric** is also not editable with ArcGIS Pro. Esri
    has developed a new version of Parcel Fabric for ArcGIS Pro.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To begin editing data in ArcGIS Pro is fairly easy. The first step is to open
    a project that contains layers that reference data that is stored in an editable
    format, such as a shapefile or geodatabase. From there, all you need to do is
    click on the Edit tab in the ribbon assuming you are using the default application
    editing option settings. It is that easy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those who have been using **ArcMap**, this may seem too easy. *What happened
    to start editing?* In ArcGIS Pro, you no longer need to start editing. You can
    immediately start editing once your project is open. This has changed somewhat
    with the release of ArcGIS Pro 2.6\. With this release, Esri did introduce an
    option such that if enabled it does require you to start an editing session before
    you are able to make changes to your data. By default, this option is not enabled.
    ArcGIS Pro also does not limit you to editing data in one workspace at a time.
    If your map contains layers that point to data stored in a geodatabase and as
    shapefiles, you can edit them all at the same time. You no longer need to start
    and stop editing each time you need to switch between **workspaces**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*What is a workspace?* A workspace is a location in which your data is stored.
    It can be a database or a folder. Hence, a geodatabase is considered a single
    workspace. A folder that contains shapefiles or other data files would be another
    workspace.'
