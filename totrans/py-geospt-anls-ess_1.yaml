    coordinates identifying where each accident occurred, and a file of county outlines

    there are several websites which provide free good-quality geospatial data. But

    in a variety of formats. Historically, the name GDAL referred to the library to
    read and write raster-format data, while OGR referred to the library to access

    used in the class and function names, so it is important to understand the difference

    However, because the World Borders Dataset uses what are called *unprojected coordinates*,
    the resulting length and area values would be measured in degrees rather than
    meters or miles. This means that the calculated lengths and areas wouldn't be
    very useful. We will look at the nature of map projections in the following chapter
    and find a way to get around this problem so we can calculate meaningful length
    and area values for polygons. But that's too complex for us to tackle right now.
