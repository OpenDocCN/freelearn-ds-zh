    for the visual exploration of spatial phenomena, mapping, and analysis. After
    getting to know some basics about QGIS as a desktop GIS, you will learn how to
    install and configure it. Then, we will go through the most common spatial data
    sources and, in the end, aggregate them into a single spatial database that will
    be used for styling, mapping, and analysis in the following chapters.

    of the available files. This is because in the GIS, a dataset is usually represented
    by several files with different extensions. For example, an ESRI shapefile consists
    of at least 4 files (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, and `.prj`) that share the same name,
    and among them, `.shp` is what you should select to load the data into QGIS. You
    see all the files because the file type filter in the bottom-right corner of the

    may take some time), you will get the `Import was successful` message. To explore
    the imported table click on the **Refresh** button ![Loading layers to a spatial
    database](img/image00303.jpeg), and you will see a geometry table in the list
    of database items. From the **Info** tab, you can view information about table,
    geometry type, fields, and triggers. The **Table** tab displays data in a tabular
    form, and the **Preview** tab displays spatial geometry, if any. By right-clicking
    on any element, you can delete, rename, or add it to the map canvas. All other
    opened layers can be loaded in a similar way.

    First of all, you learned how to install QGIS, configure its interface, and extend
    functionalities with plugins. Then we discussed common data sources you can use
    to get data into QGIS. You are now capable of exploring and managing data in different
    projections. Last but not least, you imported all your data into a portable, lightweight
    SpatiaLite database file.
