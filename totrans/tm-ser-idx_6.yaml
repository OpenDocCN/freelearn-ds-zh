    we are going to try different kinds of plots and see what they tell us about the
    iSAX index. Therefore, you should expect to see lots of visualizations in this
    chapter, and I expect that you are going to create many more visualizations on

    not the only way to create visualizations. There exist many Python packages that
    are good at plotting data, as well as programming languages such as R or Julia.
    However, JavaScript can be used for presenting your plots in a web page environment,
    which is not usually the case with the other options.

    in **JSON** format so that it can be understood by the JavaScript code – we mainly
    need to represent **the structure and the connections** between iSAX nodes in
    a way that can be understood by a computer and a programming language. Therefore,
    the first step we should take is to convert an iSAX index representation with
    its structures from Python code into a different structure made by JSON records.

    script for representing an iSAX index as a JSON file is called `exportJSON.py`.

    it in order to generate the JSON output in the desired format.

    depending on our needs for any customization requirements without breaking any
    JavaScript code, as JavaScript is going to read only the fields that it needs.
    Although the format is defined in the code, it is not used by the Python code,
    mainly because Python does not need a predefined structure for JSON data that
    is stored in dictionaries. However, it is good to have it defined as a point of
    reference. The `size` field stores the total number of subsequences stored under
    each terminal node. Inner nodes do not need such a field.

    of my experiments, I ran a utility that creates two iSAX indexes and joins them
    in a more sophisticated way than the one presented in [*Chapter 5*](B14769_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor124).
    The utility processed 2 time series with 500,000 elements each and ran for more
    than 18 days! Additionally, it took the same utility about 2 hours to process
    2 time series with 1,500,000 elements each, which means that the utility works
    well. I decided to visualize each iSAX index using a separate Python utility.
    Long story short, in the case of the time series with 500,000 elements, I mistakenly
    used 32 segments and a cardinality value of 4, instead of 4 segments and a cardinality
    value of 32! This means that the root of each iSAX index had 2 32 children! Therefore,
    joining them included so many calculations, which explained the fact that the
    utility still ran after 18 days. If I had visualized each iSAX index earlier,
    I would have found the issue much sooner.
