- en: In addition to this book, there are many other resources available that I highly
    recommend you use to get a deeper understanding of quantum computing and where
    to find the latest research. As you will notice, quantum technology is evolving
    at a very rapid pace, so much that it was rather difficult to keep up as this
    book was written. Believe it or not, it took longer to update and keep up with
    the updates for this edition than it took to write the first edition! But believe
    me, it was well worth the wait, as the current state of quantum has not only changed
    how we program but how we build and run circuits. Things which were challenging
    in the past such as creating circuits at the gate level are now much easier using
    primitives and other features of the Qiskit Runtime.

    fundamentals and the technology, but will keep you up to date with the latest
    features and releases. In fact, Qiskit 1.0, which was released during the writing
    of this book, has so much that it would likely need a book all on its own! The
    contents of this appendix is far from an exhaustive list of resources, but it
    does have key links and information:'

    [https://github.com/Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit). This is the Qiskit GitHub
    repository where you will find the open-source code for Qiskit. Like most other
    open-source GitHub projects, you can fork and contribute to the open-source project
    by either mitigating any issues or implementing a design request. You can also
    submit requests for enhancements or issues you may find. If it is your first time,
    it is recommended to work on issues labeled *good first issue*.'

    worldwide Slack channel. It is here where the real fun begins! You’ll not only
    find quantum researchers, professors, students, and quantum enthusiasts, but you’ll
    also find various channels that discuss all aspects of quantum and Qiskit, from
    hardware to software, to practically any quantum project you can think of. This
    is where you can meet others like you who are either just getting started or looking
    to advance their knowledge.'
