- en: QGIS is a very popular and user-friendly open source desktop GIS. It provides
    many useful capabilities and features and their number is continuously growing.
    It supports a wide range of raster and vector formats, as well as databases and
    OGC services. It also integrates seamlessly with other FOSSGIS applications. More
    and more users all over the world choose QGIS as their primary GIS software.

- en: The book will introduce QGIS 2.8.x, and show you how to properly prepare your
    data for comfortable work, design beautiful maps, and share them with others.
    It will also show you how to perform different types of analysis and interpret
    their results. In the final chapters, you will learn how to become more productive
    by automating repetitive tasks with the QGIS Processing framework, and how to
    extend the QGIS functionality by developing a Python plugin.

    useful when working with large and dense point datasets. In this chapter, you
    learn how to create raster heat maps from point data, and how to use them to detect
    the hottest regions and examine spatial distribution patterns. You also get to
    know another technique called binning, which is an alternative approach to heat
    maps.'
