<strong>ArcGIS</strong>, the GIS software from industry leader ESRI, allows for the analysis and presentation of geospatial data.</p><p>The integration of Python into ArcGIS has made the ArcPy module an important tool for GIS students and professionals. The ArcPy module provides a powerful way to improve productivity when performing geospatial analysis. From basic Python scripting through advanced ArcPy methods and properties, ArcPy and other Python modules will improve the speed and repeatability of any GIS work flow.</p><p>This book will guide you from basic Python scripting to advanced scripting tools. It focuses on geospatial analysis scripting and touches on automating cartographic output. By the end of this book, you will be able to create reusable modules, add repeatable analyses as script tools in ArcToolbox, and export maps automatically. By reducing the time-consuming nature of GIS from days to hours, one GIS professional can become as powerful as a whole team.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to Python for ArcGIS">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to Python for ArcGIS</em>, offers a quick introduction to the basics of Python, including other uses for the programming language. It covers Python data types and important modules used throughout the book.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Configuring the Python Environment">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Configuring the Python Environment</em>, is an introduction to how Python works: its folder structure, executables, and modules. It also explains importing modules into scripts, the built-in modules, and covers Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which are powerful programming aids.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Creating the First Python Script">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Creating the First Python Script</em>, demonstrates how to use ArcGIS ModelBuilder to model the first analysis and then export it as a Python script. String manipulations and how to use file paths in Python are also introduced.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Complex ArcPy Scripts and Generalizing Functions">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Complex ArcPy Scripts and Generalizing Functions</em>, examines how to perform analyses and produce outputs that are not possible using ModelBuilder. By using functions, or reusable code blocks, repeating code is avoided.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. ArcPy Cursors – Search, Insert, and Update">Chapter 5</a>, <em>ArcPy Cursors – Search, Insert, and Update</em>, covers ArcPy data access cursors and how they are used to search, update, or insert records in feature classes and tables. It explains the quirks of iterating using cursors, and how to only select or update the records of interest.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with ArcPy Geometry Objects">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Working with ArcPy Geometry Objects</em>, explores ArcPy Geometry objects and how they are combined with cursors to perform spatial analysis. It demonstrates how to buffer, clip, reproject, and more using the data cursors and the Arcpy geometry types without using ArcToolbox.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Creating a Script Tool">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Creating a Script Tool</em>, explains how to make scripts into tools that appear in ArcToolbox and are dynamic in nature. It explains how the tools and scripts communicate and how to set up the ArcTool dialog to correctly pass parameters to the script.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Introduction to ArcPy.Mapping">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Introduction to ArcPy.Mapping</em>, explores the powerful Arcpy.Mapping module and how to fix broken layer links, turn layers on and off, and dynamically adjust titles and text. It shows how to create dynamic map output based on a geospatial analysis.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. More ArcPy.Mapping Techniques">Chapter 9</a>, <em>More ArcPy.Mapping Techniques</em>, introduces Layer objects, and their methods and properties. It demonstrates how to control map scales and extents for data frames, and covers automated map export.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Advanced Geometry Object Methods">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Advanced Geometry Object Methods</em>, expands on the ArcPy Geometry object methods and properties. It also explains how to create a module to save code for reuse in subsequent scripts, and demonstrates how to create Excel spreadsheets containing results from a geospatial analysis.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Network Analyst and Spatial Analyst with ArcPy">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Network Analyst and Spatial Analyst with ArcPy</em>, introduces the basics of using ArcPy for advanced geospatial analysis using the ArcGIS for Desktop Network Analyst and Spatial Analyst Extensions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. The End of the Beginning">Chapter 12</a>, <em>The End of the Beginning</em>, covers other important topics that need to be understood to have a full grasp of ArcPy. These topics include the Environment Settings, XY values and Z and M resolutions, Spatial Reference Systems (Projections), the Describe functions, and more.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You will need the proprietary or free version of ArcGIS 10.1/10.2/10.3. To support your environment, you will need 2GB RAM, 32-bit or 64 bit machine hardware configuration, and Windows 7/8. Python 2.7 is required to do the programming and is installed along with ArcGIS.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for GIS students and professionals who need an understanding of how to use ArcPy to reduce repetitive tasks and perform analysis faster. It is also a valuable book for Python programmers who would like to understand how to automate geospatial analysis using the industry standard ArcGIS software and its ArcPy module.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The two data pieces, the BusStopID and the <code class="literal">averatePop</code> variable are then added to a list."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(Intersect71Census, ["STOPID","POP10"]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        busStopID = row[0]
        pop10 = row[1]
        if busStopID not in dataDictionary.keys():
            dataDictionary[busStopID] = [pop10]
        else:
            dataDictionary[busStopID].append(pop10)</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; aString = "This is a string"</strong>
<strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; bString = " and this is another string"</strong>
<strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; aString + bString </strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Select it by clicking on it, and then clicking on the <strong>Edit</strong> button."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
