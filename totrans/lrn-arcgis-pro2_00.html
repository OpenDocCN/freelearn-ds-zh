                    Preface
                
      
        <p><em>Learning ArcGIS Pro</em> explains how to successfully use this new powerful desktop <strong>Geographic Information System</strong> (<strong>GIS</strong>) application to create maps, perform spatial analysis, and maintain data. Filled with hands-on exercises based on real-world use cases, this book will show you how to use ArcGIS Pro to visualize, analyze, and maintain GIS data.</p>
        <p>Armed with powerful tools, ArcGIS Pro 2 is Esri's newest desktop GIS application that uses the modern ribbon interface and a 64-bit processor to make using GIS faster and more efficient. This second edition of <em>Learning ArcGIS Pro</em> will show you how you can use this powerful desktop GIS application to create maps, perform spatial analysis, and maintain data.</p>
        <p>The book begins by showing you how to install ArcGIS and lists the software and hardware prerequisites. You'll then be introduced to the concept of named user licensing and learn how to navigate the new ribbon interface to leverage the power of ArcGIS Pro to manage geospatial data. Once you've got to grips with the new interface, you'll build your first GIS project and learn how to use the different project resources.</p>
        <p>The book shows you how to create 2D and 3D maps by adding layers and setting and managing the symbology and labeling. You'll also discover how to use the analysis tool to visualize geospatial data. In later chapters, you’ll be introduced to Arcade, the new lightweight expression language for ArcGIS, and then advance to creating complex labels using Arcade expressions.</p>
        <p>You'll learn how to navigate the user interface to create maps, perform analysis, and manage data. You'll be able to display data based on discrete attribute values or ranges of values and label features on a GIS map based on one or more attributes using Arcade.</p>
        <p>You'll also learn how to create map books using the map series functionality and be able to share ArcGIS Pro maps, projects, and data with other GIS community members. This book also explores the most widely used geoprocessing tools for performing spatial analysis and explains how to create tasks based oncommon workflows to standardize processes. You will also learn how to automate processes using ModelBuilder and Python scripts.</p>
        <p class="mce-root">By the end of this ArcGIS Pro book, you'll have developed the core skills required to use ArcGIS Pro 2.x competently.</p>

        <p>If you want to learn how to use ArcGIS Pro to create maps and edit and analyze geospatial data, this book is for you. No knowledge of GIS fundamentals or experience with any GIS tool or ArcGIS software suite is required. Basic Windows skills, such as navigating and file management, are all you need.</p>
        <h1 id="uuid-18999b07-1718-4138-be70-62b4f29fb2fb">What this book covers</h1>
        <p><a href="0cf3a7b4-6d34-4ddf-8937-09a262ffe68e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introducing ArcGIS Pro</em>, introduces ArcGIS Pro and explains some of its capabilities in relation to other ArcGIS Products. It also provides a general overview of its capabilities and discusses the installation and licensing requirements.</p>
        <p><a href="5ff05154-4302-4ef5-8ef9-d14ca8d5bb24.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Navigating the Ribbon Interface</em>, introduces ArcGIS Pro's ribbon-based interface and commonly used interface panes or windows. It explains how to use it to access data, maps, and tools within an ArcGIS Pro project.</p>
        <p><a href="a0b88a3d-26f8-4b35-a295-2257d70802da.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Creating 2D Maps</em>, shows you how to create 2D maps within the ArcGIS Pro project framework. You will learn how to add and manage layers, control symbology, label features, and configure other properties.</p>
        <p><a href="15d59ca8-30fd-4acd-b983-02cc48c7bbc9.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating 3D Scenes</em>, shows you how users can create 3D maps within their projects. You will learn how to add layers, extrude layers to show height, and apply 3D symbology.</p>
        <p><a href="5e7c9d7b-31d5-4032-973d-1f077aa51511.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Creating and Working with Projects</em>, introduces the concept of using projects to manage GIS content. You will learn how to create and organize a project. You will also learn how to create a template project.</p>
        <p><a href="c04c8690-ca59-4b0b-8fcf-1965068446f6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Creating a Layout</em>, shows you how to create effective layouts using ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <p><a href="8270dbdc-708c-4d2e-aef4-c49d8746356b.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Creating Map Books Using Map Series</em>, explains the process required to enable and configure the Map Series functionality so you can generate your own map books. Large maps are unwieldy and become difficult to use. Smaller maps just do not allow you to show the level of detail required when out in the field. A common practice is to create a map book or series for the area. ArcGIS Pro has built-in functionality for creating these map books, and this chapter will show you how.</p>
        <p><a href="f9a95423-4c5e-4982-9a0c-6df17adaf24b.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Learning to Edit Spatial Data</em>, provides you with a basic understanding of the editing workflow in ArcGIS Pro and explains how to use many of the most commonly used tools to maintain and update your GIS data.</p>
