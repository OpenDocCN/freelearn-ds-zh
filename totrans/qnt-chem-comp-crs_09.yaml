- en: An algorithm introduced in 2014 that is defined using quantum-based hardware.
    It is the first of several variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that are currently
    being explored by the scientific industry. In a loop, a classical computer optimizes
    the parameters of a quantum circuit with respect to an objective function, such
    as finding the ground state of a molecule, which is the state with the lowest
    energy. The parameterized quantum circuit prepares a trial quantum state as a
    trial solution (an ansatz). By repeatedly measuring qubits at the output of the
    quantum circuit, we get the expectation value of the energy observable with respect
    to the trial state.
