<p class="mce-root">We have learned a lot about how to craft views of data thus far; now it is time to put everything together. The views you have created are often a means for a user to identify critical information. Dashboards allow us to combine multiple views onto a single page. By presenting multiple views of data on a single page, we are able to communicate information more efficiently. </p>
<p>However, presenting multiple views on a single page comes with a lot of challenges. You need to present the right combination of views without overwhelming the user. You also need to construct the dashboard in such a way that it is easy for users to use and understand. This chapter will walk you through features and best practices that will help you build actionable and informative dashboards. In this final chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to dashboards</li>
<li>Effective design practices</li>
<li>Exploring the Dashboard and Layout panes</li>
<li>Telling stories</li>
<li>Putting everything together</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction to dashboards</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A dashboard is a visual display of important information on a single page. It usually consists of multiple related components that allows users to track changes or get information. Dashboards are embedded with controls that allow users to filter information. These filters often control multiple sheets on the dashboard. This allows users to view various related components without having to switch screens.</p>
<p>Filters are how users interact with the views in a dashboard – they allow users to answer questions. What distinguishes dashboards from reports is that dashboards are predominantly visual. While they can contain tabular summaries, they should emphasize visuals. There have been many studies that describe the importance of data visualization. The main findings are that data visualizations excel at revealing patterns, outliers, trends, and correlations that can't easily be found when looking at a table of numbers. </p>
<p>You can think of a dashboard as how you choose to present your sheets. A dashboard should be able to communicate key findings in the data. The visualizations that make up a dashboard are interactive via filters and controls. Effective information design is as much art as science. There is no one-size-fits-all method or technique to create robust and useful dashboards. </p>
<p>Dashboards can add a tremendous amount of value to an organization, but only if they are thought out. In the next section, we will discuss how to create dashboards that will help users make better sense of data.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Effective design practices</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By the time you are ready to create a dashboard, you have already done a tremendous amount of work to create sheets. The sheets are the backbone of the dashboard; care must not only be taken in developing individual sheets but also how they are presented together in the dashboard. In this section, we will discuss best practices for effective dashboard design. While these tips are not exhaustive, they will provide you with a good starting point on your path to developing powerful dashboards. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Purpose</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The most important item to consider before building any solution is to know the purpose. What questions will the dashboard answer? Having a list of specific questions to answer gives you a clear purpose. You should always have a have a clearly defined purpose when developing dashboards. Knowing the purpose forces you to address the needs of the viewers. In business, knowing the purpose of the dashboard usually involves understanding what <strong>key performance indicators</strong> (<strong>KPIs</strong>) users are interested in.</p>
<p>By knowing your audience and understanding their needs, you will be able to develop an actionable dashboard that users will want to use. At the end of the day, dashboards need to answer questions, keep people informed, and be easy to use. If these three components are not met, then everyone loses. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Good design principles</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It can be easy to get caught up in building cool visualizations, with tons of slick features. Always remember the purpose of the dashboard. It should provide the information that users are looking for in a way that is easy to understand. When constructing a dashboard, there are many challenges you will face. Use the tips in the following section as you begin to face these challenges.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Limiting the number of sheets used</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Limit the number of sheets used – you do not want to overwhelm users with sheets and clutter. A dashboard should not be hard to use (or understand). By limiting the number of sheets used in a dashboard, you limit the elements a user needs to pay attention to. One of the most common contributors to bad dashboard design is the inclusion of too many sheets. As a general rule, you should use no more than three visualizations in a dashboard.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Presenting multiple views allows you to include more information and finer details. More information also means that users can get lost in what is important and what is not. Thinking about the big picture when designing your dashboard can help mitigate this.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Being clear and concise</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It is fun to create various chart types. Tableau makes it easy to include a large amount of extra information depending on the type of visual. Once again, it is important to know your audience. Try to make it easy for them to access the information they are looking for, even if it means simplifying your design. Design with your audience in mind. A good dashboard is one that people use. People are more likely to use simple dashboards as opposed to complex dashboards.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Constructing a cohesive story</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Construct a cohesive story – dashboards should communicate information clearly and efficiently. One of the biggest obstacles you will face is how to present the various sheets in your workbook together in one dashboard in a manner that is seamless. Remember that you are trying to present a large amount of data in a limited space. You need to think about the relationship between sheets as you are working toward your end goal. The story you tell is dependent on what the audience wants and needs to see.</p>
<p>Now that we have described a few good design principles, let us discuss how to create dashboards using the Dashboard and Layout panes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Exploring the Dashboard and Layout panes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are two tabs in the menu on the left-hand side of the Dashboard pane. The two tabs are distinct panes – Dashboard and Layout. The Dashboard pane allows you to place sheets and objects in the dashboard. It is also where you set screen-sizing options. The Layout pane gives you finer control of how sheets and objects are formatted in the dashboard. The Layout pane allows you to precisely position and pad items in the dashboard. We will discuss both of these panes in the following section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Dashboard pane</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this section, we will begin building our dashboard. In order to create a dashboard, you must have created at least one sheet. A dashboard is a blank page where you can combine multiple sheets. Dashboards are interactive in a number of ways, primarily with the use of filters. To create a dashboard, click the New Dashboard button at the bottom of the workbook. The Dashboard tab is available at the bottom of the workbook:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/20446154-beac-4563-a170-da3ac6c19f6a.png" style="width:37.42em;height:4.67em;"/></p>
<p>Once you have clicked on the New Dashboard button (bottom of the workbook), a blank dashboard page will open. Similar to the worksheets page, there are two tabs on the left pane – Dashboard and Layout. The Dashboard pane is the default view. The Dashboard pane contains four primary sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device Preview</li>
<li>Size</li>
<li>Sheets</li>
<li>Objects</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now discuss each of these sections in more detail. The following screenshot displays the four primary sections (Device Preview, Size, Sheets, and Objects) in the left pane:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1474 image-border" src="img/a8220e16-31b3-4cd4-af14-c8182414b4fd.png" style="width:127.50em;height:91.17em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Sheets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To add a sheet to the view, either double-click the name under the Sheets portion of the pane, drag and drop the sheet to the canvas, or right-click the sheet name and select Add to Dashboard.</p>
<p>In the following example, the sheet titled bar chart was double-clicked. The sheet is now in the dashboard along with all the filters that were applied in the bar chart sheet:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1475 image-border" src="img/d9dfbee7-52f0-44e0-9db6-5275d1982dde.png" style="width:114.08em;height:68.33em;"/></p>
<p>Right-clicking on a sheet brings up the following menu: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1476 image-border" src="img/a9aaf11b-e563-4e2f-8cb2-7f2c0b41bc5b.png" style="width:19.92em;height:13.92em;"/></p>
<p>The following is a short description of each of the items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add to Dashboard: Adds the selected sheet to the dashboard.</li>
<li>Remove from Dashboard: Removes the selected sheet from the dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to Sheet: Takes you to the selected sheet in the Tableau workbook.</li>
<li>Duplicate sheet: Creates a copy of the selected sheet.</li>
<li>Duplicate as Crosstab: The selected sheet is duplicated as a pivot table. This is an excellent way to see data used in a visualization as rows and columns. The following screenshot shows the crosstab version of the sheet (bar chart) that is in the dashboard:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1477 image-border" src="img/760e017c-380a-4849-b124-68ea8bcbce74.png" style="width:26.08em;height:47.17em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Hide: Hides the selected sheet in the Tableau workbook.</li>
<li>Rename Sheet...: Allows you to rename the selected sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to duplicating a sheet, you can duplicate a dashboard. To do this, go down to the Sheets menu, right-click the Dashboard tab, then select Duplicate:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1478 image-border" src="img/3bf597e0-e761-43b8-af55-1229c1387b6e.png" style="width:22.83em;height:34.33em;"/></p>
<p>Duplicating a dashboard creates a new dashboard that looks exactly like the copied dashboard. The new dashboard still references all the same worksheets as the original dashboard. In the next section, we will discuss various objects that you can add to the dashboard other than sheets.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Objects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>An object is an item that you can add to your dashboard. Objects allow you to customize the look of your dashboard as well as allowing for additional features. To add an object to the dashboard, either double-click the object name or drag and drop the object icon to the canvas. Depending on what object you choose, you will have a few options for customization. The following table gives a short description of each of the objects:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Icon</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Sheet and description</strong></p>

</td>
<td>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Horizontal and Vertical: These options provide horizontal and vertical layout containers that allow you to group related items. These containers can be thought of as subsections of the dashboard. By creating these objects, you have greater control of formatting specific areas of the dashboard. In the following screenshot, a vertical layout container was dragged and dropped below the bar chart sheet:</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1479 image-border" src="img/5ec620fc-b6e3-485e-9a1d-8a1d3f9e15fe.png" style="width:86.00em;height:61.58em;"/></p>
<p><br/>
You can place other objects in this vertical container. Adjusting the size of this container also affects the size of other objects. Notice how the bar chart sheet now takes up half the height of the dashboard once the vertical container is included.</p>

<p>Text: An object that allows you to enter in text for headers, descriptions, and other data. In the following screenshot, a text object was added to the top of the dashboard. The text says Dashboard Title. You can format the text however you like:</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1480 image-border" src="img/2e28459d-c6af-4095-b604-9eee349a5118.png" style="width:82.08em;height:50.92em;"/></p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><br/>
Once the image is in the dashboard, you are able to format it further. Click on the Image object then the down caret icon on the upper-right to display a list of options available to customize the image:</p>

</td>
<td>
<p>Web Page: An object that allows you to embed a web page in the dashboard. In the following screenshot, the image object was replaced with a web page object. When the Web Page object icon is double-clicked or is dragged and dropped onto the dashboard, a URL window will appear. Enter the name of the web page URL here, then click OK:<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1483 image-border" src="img/9a37aede-3c01-4e48-8614-0c93c856a7a2.png" style="width:77.42em;height:66.00em;"/></p>

<p>Extension: Allows you to add extensions to your Tableau dashboard. In the following screenshot, an extension object was added to the dashboard where the web page object was. A Choose an Extension menu will appear:<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1484 image-border" src="img/438c3cd8-317b-49fc-96ee-f2a3e361b8ff.png" style="width:80.17em;height:60.33em;"/></p>
<p><br/>
The topic of extensions is outside the scope of this book due to how many different extensions exist. The important thing to know is that extensions are web apps that can communicate with Tableau. They allow you to use custom applications with the data you are connected to via Tableau. For a list of available extensions, visit Tableau's extension gallery at <a href="https://extensiongallery.tableau.com/">https://extensiongallery.tableau.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Not all web pages will appear when added to the web page object. This is mainly due to web security issues. If the page you are adding does not work, we suggest you google or check out the Tableau forms for a reason why.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Sheets and objects that are placed in dashboards are laid out in one of two ways: tiled or floating. In the next section, we will discuss the differences between them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Tiled versus floating objects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">The following screenshot shows the Objects menu. We have discussed each of the individual objects available in the preceding section. The toggle menu here allows you to choose between tiled objects and floating objects:</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e65c5b03-a5bc-4eda-a5c0-cc394e2207f4.png" style="width:12.08em;height:11.50em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiled objects</strong>: Each object in the dashboard is arranged using a grid mechanism. Tiled objects snap together with other tiled objects to form a view using grids that do not overlap. Tiled objects are much easier to work with. Tiled objects generally resize according to display settings much better than floating objects. Our suggestion is to use tiled objects whenever possible. </li>
<li><strong>Floating objects</strong>: Each object in the dashboard is free to be placed in any location. Floating objects can be placed on top of other objects – they are not constrained by grids. While floating objects give you the ability to make better use of space, this comes at a cost. That cost is how these objects are rendered when screen size changes. Tiled objects automatically resize based on the screen settings while tiled objects do not. One of the primary uses of floating objects is for legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>When adding multiple sheets to a dashboard, you must think about how the user will be able to see the different visualizations. Best practices dictate that a user should not have to scroll to see different elements of a dashboard. We know that this is not always possible but selecting the right display settings can make a huge impact on how easy it is for a user to use the dashboard. We will discuss display sizing and the device preview option in the next section. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Display settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To see the Size menu, click on the down caret to the right of the current size of the dashboard. A pop-up menu will appear, allowing you to select from commonly used resolutions for devices. The following screenshot shows the results:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1485 image-border" src="img/65596da9-5968-4c7d-a37f-b3be53c0c053.png" style="width:49.83em;height:39.50em;"/></p>
<div><p class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">Clicking the down caret to the right of the current display size (Fixed size) brings up the sizing options. There are three sizing options, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/ec25ab10-2c20-40d1-81f8-500342a906dc.png" style="width:15.42em;height:13.17em;"/></div>
<p>The following is a short description of the sizing options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed size: This is the default size. A fixed size means that the dashboard stays the same size regardless of how big the screen of the viewer is. If the dashboard extends across or below the size of the screen then the user will be presented with scroll bars. There are pros and cons to each sizing option. With fixed-size dashboards, you can control the exact position of objects. If you choose to use floating elements, a fixed-size dashboard is the suggested option. When using a fixed-size dashboard, you can select from the following suggestions for specific devices:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1486 image-border" src="img/ad7adb82-2d1c-4177-a4bc-e1dc224b3ad3.png" style="width:16.67em;height:28.08em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automatic: Select this option if you want Tableau to determine display settings. Tableau will attempt to resize the window based on the user's screen size. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Range: With the Range setting, you select a minimum and maximum display size. The dashboard resizes to the minimum display if the user's display is smaller than the minimum selected. Similarly, the dashboard resizes to the maximum display if the user's display is larger than the maximum selected.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Device preview</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After adding items to your dashboard, you can use the Device Preview option to see how the dashboard will render on different displays. The following screenshot highlights the Device Preview section that appears when the Device Preview button is clicked in the Dashboard pane:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1487 image-border" src="img/963e91cf-0798-4d36-8a25-d80e787c7ea0.png" style="width:133.83em;height:87.50em;"/></p>
<p>Use the device layout menu to see how the dashboard will look when viewed on different devices. This is a great way to see how your dashboard will be displayed on another user's device. Remember, just because a dashboard looks good on your device, it does not mean that it will look the same on another user's device. </p>
<p>Now that we have discussed the Dashboard pane, let us move on to the Layout pane.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The dashboard Layout pane</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Proper sizing and arrangement make dashboards easier to use. Reorganizing sheet positions, shifting objects, and general formatting actions can help build a seamless user experience. In the preceding sections, we discussed display settings and arrangement options in the Dashboard pane. Now we will talk about additional formatting options that can be applied to sheets and objects to help refine your dashboard. The following screenshot displays the available options in the Layout pane:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1488 image-border" src="img/7c805890-842e-4e3d-a553-2aa89988b4f6.png" style="width:54.50em;height:34.92em;"/></p>
<p>The following is a short description of the layout options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show title: Select a sheet or object in the dashboard. Checking/unchecking the Show title checkbox displays this item's title. Use this to insert or remove a title.</li>
<li>Floating: Select a sheet or object in the dashboard. Checking/unchecking the Floating checkbox changes the item from tiled to floating (or vice versa).</li>
<li>Position:<strong> </strong>If you select a fixed size or range for the dashboard size, then you can fine-tune where sheets and objects are displayed on a dashboard. The x and y are offsets from the top-left corner signifying pixel length from this point.</li>
<li>Size: If you change your sheets or objects to floating from tiled then you can manually set the width and height. The w is the width and h is the height in pixels.</li>
<li>Border: Adds a border around a sheet or object.</li>
<li>Background:<strong> </strong>Adds a background color to a sheet or object.</li>
<li>Outer Padding: Adds outer padding to a sheet or object. Outer padding is space added to the outside of the element – it adds spacing for aesthetic purposes:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1489 image-border" src="img/cbee7fee-f47c-4e5a-a42c-8536fd743a20.png" style="width:17.75em;height:22.58em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Inner Padding:<strong> </strong>Similar to outer padding. This adds inner padding to a sheet or object. Inner padding is space added to the inside of the element – it adds spacing for aesthetic purposes.</li>
<li>Item hierarchy: The item hierarchy shows you how objects are layered if you are using floating objects. Items are ordered from top to bottom, meaning objects that are higher up in the hierarchy are on top of the other items:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/828ac7b3-f8f3-4ade-b599-ac09776bdd37.png" style="width:20.25em;height:20.08em;"/></p>
<p>In the next section, we will go over another way to share your analysis with users – stories.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Telling stories</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this section, we will discuss stories. In order to create a story, you must have created at least one sheet. A story is a blank page where you can combine sheets with text and other objects. You create multiple story points and present them one after another to tell a story with the data. Stories are an excellent way to share the findings of your analysis. To create a story, click the New Story button at the bottom of the workbook. The Story tab is available at the bottom of the workbook:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c1faf9f8-b2d1-4cac-a884-b66302ae74bc.png"/></p>
<p>Once you have clicked on the New Story button (bottom of the workbook), a blank story page will open. A story is a collection of visualizations presented in an ordered format. A story is similar to a PowerPoint presentation. The story comprises a series of story points. The following screenshot shows a blank story page:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1490 image-border" src="img/f8e7d418-f3a5-41c2-8745-11d5b216b58f.png" style="width:49.17em;height:36.17em;"/></p>
<p>There are two tabs in the menu on the left-hand side of the story pane. The two tabs are distinct panes – Story and Layout. The layout of the Story page is similar to that of the dashboard page. The Story pane allows you to place sheets and objects in the story. It is also where you set screen-sizing options. The Layout pane gives you finer control of how to navigate through the story. We will discuss both of these panes in the following section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Story pane</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Similar to dashboards, you should think about the purpose of your story. What data you present and how you present the data is a major component of storytelling. You are leading your viewers to a conclusion that should be supported with data. As with dashboards, we believe that you should have a plan or an outline before developing. Sitting down and crafting a narrative will help make your story better.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The Story pane contains four primary sections – New story point, Sheets, Text, and Size. The following is a short description of the layout options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Sheets: To add a sheet to the story point, either double-click the name under the Sheets portion of the pane or drag and drop the sheet to the canvas. In the following example, the sheet titled bar chart was double-clicked. The sheet is now in the Story pane along with all the filters that were applied in the bar chart sheet. The following screenshot displays the Story pane after adding the bar chart sheet:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1491 image-border" src="img/8f0b2d98-928f-4555-803c-41b32f2639a1.png" style="width:43.08em;height:40.00em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">New story point: If you think of your story as a presentation then a story point is a single slide. Stories are made of multiple story points in a sequence that conveys a point or message. The New story point section has two buttons – Blank and Duplicate. The Blank button creates a new story point for you to work on while the Duplicate button creates a copy of the current story point. In the preceding screenshot, there is only one story point – story points are represented by gray boxes in the middle of the pane under the story title. In the following screenshot, a blank story point was created – notice how there are now two gray boxes under the title of Story 1 in the canvas:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1493 image-border" src="img/a4840d93-3848-40a7-a47a-963dfcd7df0d.png" style="width:105.08em;height:38.50em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Text: Click to add a text field to your story point. In the following screenshot, text was added to the story point. You can drag and drop the text field to anywhere on the story point as it is a floating object. The Show title checkbox controls whether or not to show the story point title (Story 1 in the upper-left corner of the canvas in the following screenshot):</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1494 image-border" src="img/695dec48-f746-42c7-bc83-5b8cd9d26e20.png" style="width:44.00em;height:42.17em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Size: Select the display size of your story. This should be the size at which your users will view the story. There is a list of predefined screen sizes if you click the down caret in the Size options:<br/></li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/978eda15-d1f1-4c7c-8834-81cad372eb46.png" style="width:21.42em;height:14.42em;"/></p>
<p>Now that we have had a quick walk-through of the Story pane, we will move onto the Layout pane.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The story Layout pane</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Layout pane contains options on how to present navigation options to users. You can select from caption boxes, numbers, dots, and arrows only. Play around with these settings to find what works best for your story:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ca098dd3-fcd8-4023-b8b0-098cac639836.png"/></p>
<p>Once you have completed your story, you can either share it using Tableau's presentation mode or publish the story to Tableau Server. The Full screen button is available in the upper-right corner of the menu ribbon:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d2c39ca9-9233-4137-8d5a-9bbe26593c82.png"/></p>
<p>So far in this chapter, we have discussed the features and options available to create dashboards and stories. You now have all the pieces necessary to create and share a professional view of the story you wish to tell. As we come to the end of our journey, we will close with our final thoughts on making compelling data visualizations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Creating dashboards and stories is a combination of art and science. The visualizations you develop are only as good as the underlying data. If the data is not accurate then the solution is, at best, useless and, at worst, harmful. It is more beneficial for a user to have no information as opposed to incorrect information that they are led to believe is accurate. The message of the visualization needs to be true. Good visualizations enhance the message. They allow users to identify trends, spot patterns, and understand information more efficiently.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, you have learned how to work with Tableau. Some of the key concepts you should now feel comfortable with are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting to and modeling your data</li>
<li>Working with data in the worksheet</li>
<li>Selecting the proper chart type depending on your data</li>
<li>Plotting geographical data</li>
<li>Creating custom calculations</li>
<li>Understanding <strong>Level of Detail</strong> (<strong>LOD</strong>) expressions</li>
<li>Using Tableau's embedded analytic features</li>
<li>Sharing your analyses via dashboards and stories</li>
</ul>
<p>We started our journey by explaining how Tableau can help you and your organization make better sense of your data. We hope that you have learned about the key features of Tableau and how to use them to take full advantage of your data. While the concepts presented in this book are not exhaustive, they are enough to help you pass the Tableau Desktop Certified exam. The best way to get better at Tableau is to start using it. You now have a solid foundation on which to build. Our final advice to you is to find questions that you wish to answer, get the data to do so, and use the methods you have learned in this book to help you create accurate, intuitive, and visually stunning reporting solutions.</p>
