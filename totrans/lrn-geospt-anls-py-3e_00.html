<p class="mce-root">The book starts by giving you the background of geospatial analysis, and then offers a flow of the techniques and technology used and splits the field into its component specialty areas, such as <strong>Geographic Information Systems</strong> (<strong>GIS</strong>), remote sensing, elevation data, advanced modeling, and real-time data. The focus of the book is to lay a strong foundation in using the powerful Python language and framework to approach geospatial analysis effectively. In doing so, we'll focus on using pure Python as well as certain Python tools and APIs, and using generic algorithms. The readers will be able to analyze various forms of geospatial data, learn about real-time data tracking, and see how to apply what they learn to interesting scenarios.</p>
<p class="mce-root">While many third-party geospatial libraries are used throughout the examples, a special effort will be made by us to use pure Python, with no dependencies, whenever possible. This focus on pure Python 3 examples is what will set this book apart from nearly all other resources in this field. We will also go through some popular libraries that weren't in the previous version of the book.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "To demonstrate this, the following example accesses the same file that we just saw but by using <kbd>urllib</kbd> instead of <kbd>ftplib</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>import ftplib<br/><br/>server = "ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov"<br/>dir = "hazards/DART/20070815_peru"<br/>fileName = "21415_from_20070727_08_55_15_tides.txt"</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"> if (sinSigma == 0):<br/>        distance = 0  # coincident points<br/>        break<br/>    cosSigma = sinU1*sinU2 + cosU1*cosU2*cosLam<br/>    <strong>sigma = math.atan2(sinSigma, cosSigma)</strong><br/>    sinAlpha = cosU1 * cosU2 * sinLam / sinSigma<br/>    cosSqAlpha = 1 - sinAlpha**2</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>pip install virtualenv</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select System info from the Administration panel."</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
