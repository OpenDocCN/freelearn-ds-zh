<p class="calibre3">Hello there! <strong class="bold">Network science</strong> combines the power of analytics with the deep theoretical tools of graph theory to solve difficult problems in data analytics. This empowers researchers and industry engineers/data scientists to analyze data at scale and reframe intractable analytics problems to produce powerful insights into problems and predictions about system behaviors, including biological, physical, and social systems of interest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are many important applications of network science today, including these:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Social network data</li>
<li class="calibre11">Spatial data</li>
<li class="calibre11">Time series data</li>
<li class="calibre11">Spatiotemporal data</li>
<li class="calibre11">More advanced data structures, such as ontologies or hypergraphs</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">This book gives a brief overview of social network applications and focuses on the cutting edge of network science applications to areas of data science, such as transportation logistics, conversation, public health, linguistics, and education. By the end of your journey, you’ll be able to frame your own data problem within the framework of network science to derive insights and tackle difficult problems in your field.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We will provide the necessary mathematical background as we dive into practical examples and code related to our work in academia and industry over the past decades, including work on predicting Ebola outbreaks, forecasting food price volatility, modeling genetic and linguistic relationships, and mining social networks for insights into social tie formation. As the world faces food shortages, public health crises, economic inequality, supply chain breakdowns, and environmental crises, network science will play an important role in big data analytics for social good.</p>
<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p class="calibre3">This book is for you if you are working with data. To get the most out of the book, you should have some familiarity with Python, particularly the <code>pandas</code> and <code>numpy</code> packages. In addition, some familiarity with data analytics is assumed, though the network science tools and problems we tackle are built from scratch for readers without a background in those problems or methods.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Network science has a rich history in many scientific disciplines, including epidemiology, biomedical engineering, sociology, genetics, environmental science, particle physics, computer science, and economics. Its foundations in graph theory influence research in many areas of pure and applied mathematics as well. Anyone in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics can benefit from network science’s toolset and approach to problem-solving.</p>
<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-8" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor007" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21087_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">What Is a Network?</em>, introduces the theoretical concept of a network and provides several examples of networks in real-world applications, including work with random graphs. We’ll also get started with Python’s igraph and NetworkX packages.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a href="B21087_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Wrangling Data into Networks with NetworkX and igraph</em>, builds on <a href="B21087_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a> by providing three examples of real-world data that can be formulated as network data and showing how to convert data into network form in Python. We’ll introduce problems involving spatial data, temporal data, and spatiotemporal data and explore how network science can solve these problems by converting the data into network form.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-9" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor008" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p class="calibre3">We provide Python scripts and assume some knowledge of basic Python analytics packages (such as NumPy and scikit-learn) and Python syntax. We assume some knowledge of basic analytics tasks such as summary statistics and working with different types of data in Python with either <code>numpy</code> or <code>pandas</code>. Scripts are written for each chapter, with later scripts often depending on earlier scripts in the chapter to build knowledge. Other concepts in Python and in analytics will be introduced conceptually and then with Python code examples.</p>
