- en: In a world where data is becoming increasingly important, data analysts, scientists,
    and business people need tools to analyze and process large volumes of data efficiently.
    This book is my attempt to pass on what I've learned so far, so that you can quickly
    become an effective and efficient R programmer. Reading it will help you understand
    how to use R to solve complex problems, avoid some of the mistakes I've made,
    and teach you useful techniques that can be helpful in a variety of contexts.
    In the process, I hope to show you that, despite its uncommon aspects, R is an
    elegant and powerful language, and is well suited for data analysis and statistics,
    as well as complex systems.

- en: After reading this book, you will be familiar with R's fundamentals, as well
    as some of its advanced features. You will understand data structures, and you
    will know how to efficiently deal with them. You will also understand how to design
    complex systems that perform efficiently, and how to make these systems usable
    by other people through web applications. At a lower level, you will understand
    how to work with object-oriented programming, functional programming, and reactive
    programming, and what code may be better written in each of these paradigms. You
    will learn how to use various cutting edge tools that R provides to develop software,
    how to identify performance bottlenecks, and how to fix them, possibly using other
    programming languages such as Fortran and C++. Finally, you will be comfortable
    reading and understanding the majority of R code, as well as provide feedback
    for others' code.

    to R*, covers the R basics you need to understand the rest of the examples. It
    is not meant to be a thorough introduction to R. Rather, it''s meant to give you
    the very basic concepts and techniques you need to quickly get started with the
    three examples contained in the book, and which I introduce next.'

    first example shows how to analyze votes with descriptive statistics and linear
    models, and it is presented in [Chapter 2](part0059.html#1O8H60-f494c932c729429fb734ce52cafce730),

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was written in a Linux environment (specifically Ubuntu 17.10), and
    was also tested with a macOS, High Sierra. Even though it was not tested on a
    Windows computer, all of the R code presented in this book should work fine with
    one. The only substantial difference is that when I show you how to perform a
    task using a Terminal, it will be the bash terminal, which is available in Linux
    and macOS by default. In the case of Windows, you will need to use the cmd.exe
    terminal, for which you can find a lot of information online. Keep in mind that
    if you're using a Windows computer, you should be prepared to do a bit more research
    on your end to replicate the same functionality, but you should not have much
    trouble at all.

    the examples shown in this book. I show you how to do so for Linux and macOS,
    specifically Ubuntu 17.10 and High Sierra. If you're using Windows, the same principles
    apply but the specifics may be a bit different. However, I'm sure it will not
    be too hard in any case.

    code in this book: external and internal. Software outside of R is what I call
    external requirements. Software inside of R, meaning R packages, is what I refer
    to as internal requirements. I walk you through the installation of both of them
    in the appendix.'

- en: This book is for those who wish to develop software in R. You don't need to
    be an expert or professional programmer to follow this book, but you do need to
    be interested in learning how R works. My hope is that this book is useful for
    people ranging from beginners to advanced by providing hands-on examples that
    may help you understand R in ways you previously did not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I assume basic programming, mathematical, and statistical knowledge, because
    there are various parts in the book where concepts from these disciplines will
    be used, and they will not be explained in detail. If you have programmed something
    yourself in any programming language, know basic linear algebra and statistics,
    and know what linear regression is, you have everything you need to understand
    this book.

    For example, if you are an analyst employed by an organization that requires you
    to do frequent data processing to produce reports on a regular basis, and you
    need to develop programs to automate such tasks, this book is for you. If you
    are an academic researcher who wants to use current techniques, combine them,
    and develop tools to test them automatically, this book is for you. If you're
    a professional programmer looking for ways to take advantage of advanced R features,
    this book is for you. Finally, if you're preparing for a future in which data
    will be of paramount importance (it already is), this book is for you.
