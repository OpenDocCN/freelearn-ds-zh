			<p>Now that we have discussed what we can do with RDCOMClient, let’s go through the <span class="No-Break">installation process.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Installing RDCOMClient</h2>
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> install packages in R, you would usually type in the command prompt something like <strong class="source-inline">install.packages("dplyr")</strong> if you wanted to install the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">dplyr</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> library.</span></p>
			<p>For the <strong class="source-inline">RDCOMClient</strong> library, this is going to change a little bit. Typically, if you are using RStudio—your default repository from where you are going to get packages—it is going to default to the Global (CDN) RStudio repository, but for this package, we are going to give some special instructions to the <span class="No-Break">installation command.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">RDCOMClient is only available <span class="No-Break">on Windows.</span></p>
			<p>Here is how the command <span class="No-Break">will look:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
install.packages(
"RDCOMClient",
repos = "http://www.omegahat.net/R",
type = "win.binary"
)</pre>			<p>Now that<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> we have installed <strong class="source-inline">RDCOMClient</strong>, we can move on to doing something with it. In the next section, we will go over some examples of how to use it. This library installation can be clunky and, for some, the following will <span class="No-Break">work better:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Install.packages("devtools")
Library(devtools)
Install_github("omegahat/RDCOMClient")</pre>			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Executing sample VBA with RDCOMClient</h1>
			<p>For this<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> execution, the first thing we will need is a new workbook. Let’s call <span class="No-Break">it </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">mult_by_rand_ch3</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>On <strong class="bold">Sheet1</strong>, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>create two columns, one called <strong class="source-inline">Record</strong> and the other called <strong class="source-inline">Value</strong>. These columns will simply be the numbers 1 through 10. When that is done, we will need to go ahead and create a simple VBA script to execute from the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">RDCOMClient</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> library.</span></p>
			<p>We are going to write a macro that will take the <strong class="source-inline">Value</strong> column and then multiply the number by a random number using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">RAND()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> function.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s go over the steps to make the macro and describe how it works. First, take a look at the following <span class="No-Break">VBA code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Sub MultiplyByRandom()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    ' Set the range to the desired range on Sheet1
    Set rng = Sheets("Sheet1").Range("B2:B11")
    ' Loop through each cell in the range
    For Each cell In rng
        ' Multiply the cell value by RAND() and store the result in the adjacent cell
        cell.Offset(0, 1).Value = cell.Value * Rnd()
    Next cell
End Sub</pre>			<p>In order to<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> create this macro, you need to click on the <strong class="bold">Developer</strong> tab or press <em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">F11</em> to open the Visual <span class="No-Break">Basic editor.</span></p>
			<p>Insert a<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> new module by going to <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> | <strong class="bold">Module</strong>. Once you have done this, you can type the preceding code into the window and close the <span class="No-Break">editor window.</span></p>
			<p>To get some clarity, let’s go over what each line of the <span class="No-Break">macro does:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Sub MultiplyByRandom()</strong>: This line defines the start of a VBA subroutine <span class="No-Break">named </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">MultiplyByRandom</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Dim rng As Range</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Dim cell As Range</strong>: These lines declare two <strong class="source-inline">Range</strong> variables named <strong class="source-inline">rng</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">cell</strong>. These variables will be used to store ranges and individual <span class="No-Break">cells, respectively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Set rng = Sheets("Sheet1").Range("B2:B11</strong>: This line sets the <strong class="source-inline">rng</strong> variable to refer to the range of cells from B2 to B11 on <strong class="source-inline">Sheet1</strong>. It specifies the location where the numbers <span class="No-Break">are stored.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">For Each cell In rng</strong>: This line starts a loop that will iterate through each cell in the <strong class="source-inline">rng</strong> range. It assigns the current cell to the <strong class="source-inline">cell</strong> variable for each iteration of <span class="No-Break">the loop.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">cell.Offset(0, 1).Value = cell.Value * Rnd()</strong>: This line multiplies the value of the current cell by a randomly generated number using the <strong class="source-inline">Rnd()</strong> function. It then stores the result in the adjacent cell, which is obtained using the <strong class="source-inline">Offset</strong> method to shift the reference one column to the right (<strong class="source-inline">0</strong> rows, <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">1</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> column).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Next cell</strong>: This line signifies the end of the loop. It moves the loop to the next cell in the range and repeats the process until all cells have <span class="No-Break">been processed.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">End Sub</strong>: This line marks the end of the <strong class="source-inline">MultiplyByRandom</strong> <span class="No-Break">VBA subroutine.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In order<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> to run this macro, we can write the <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>R code that will execute it. We are going to do this with the <strong class="source-inline">RDCOMClient</strong> library and use the <strong class="source-inline">$Run()</strong> method from the Excel <strong class="source-inline">Workbook</strong> object <span class="No-Break">we create.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s go ahead and write that <span class="No-Break">script now.</span></p>
			<p>The following is a breakdown of each line in the R code, explained in <span class="No-Break">simple terms.</span></p>
			<p>This line loads the <strong class="source-inline">RDCOMClient</strong> library, which provides functionality for interacting with Microsoft Office applications, such <span class="No-Break">as Excel:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Load the library
library(RDCOMClient)</pre>			<p>The following lines define variables for the file path and name of an Excel workbook. They will only work for the author and should be updated to reflect where you are working from. It is possible to be working in a project and use something like <strong class="source-inline">paste0(getwd(), "/")</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">f_path</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">f_chapter</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">f_name</strong> variables specify the directory path, subdirectory name, and filename, respectively. The <strong class="source-inline">paste0()</strong> function is used to concatenate these variables to create the complete <span class="No-Break">file path:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

The <strong class="source-inline">TRUE</strong> argument indicates that the changes should be saved before closing. Finally, the <strong class="source-inline">Quit()</strong> method of the <strong class="source-inline">xl_app</strong> Excel application is used to close the <span class="No-Break">Excel application:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			</ul>
			<p>The integration of Python and VBA enables you to unlock the full potential of Excel, leverage the strengths of both languages, and take your data analysis, reporting, and automation skills to <span class="No-Break">new heights.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s proceed to set up the environment for executing VB<a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>A code <span class="No-Break">from Python.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Setting up the environment</h2>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>successfully execute VBA code from Python, we need to set up the environment by installing the required dependencies and configuring the necessary connections. This section will walk you through the steps to ensure a smooth setup process in three <span class="No-Break">easy steps.</span></p>
			<h3>Installing the pywin32 library</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong> library<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> serves as a bridge between Python and the Windows API and COM objects. It<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> enables Python to interact with Excel’s object model and execute <span class="No-Break">VBA code.</span></p>
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> install <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong>, you can use a package manager such as <strong class="source-inline">pip</strong> by running the following command in your command prompt <span class="No-Break">or terminal:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
python –m pip install pywin32==306</pre>			<p>Here is how <span class="No-Break">it runs:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19142_3_01.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Installing pywin32 on Windows with pip"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Installing pywin32 on Windows with pip</p>
			<p>This will install the <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong> package and its dependencies, allowing Python to communicate <span class="No-Break">with Excel.</span></p>
			<h3>Establishing a connection with Excel</h3>
			<p>Once <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> installed, we can establish a connection with Excel from Python. This connection allows us to access Excel’s workbooks, worksheets, ranges, and other Excel-specific <span class="No-Break">functionalities programmatically.</span></p>
			<p>To establish a connection, we can make use of the <strong class="source-inline">win32com.client</strong> module provided by <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong>. Here’s an example of how to create a connection <span class="No-Break">with Excel:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import win32com.client as win32
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")</pre>			<p>If the environment is set up correctly, this code returns nothing. However, if the code returns <strong class="source-inline">com_error</strong>, please go to the <em class="italic">Error handling with the environmental </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">setup</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19142_3_02.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Testing the connection to Excel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Testing the connection to Excel</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> preceding code snippet, we imported the <strong class="source-inline">win32com.client</strong> module and created a new instance of the Excel application using the <strong class="source-inline">win32.Dispatch</strong> method. This creates a connection between Python and Excel, allowing us to interact with Excel’s objects and execute <span class="No-Break">VBA code.</span></p>
			<h3>Creating an interface to interact with VBA code</h3>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>connection established, we can create an interface that enables us to execute VBA code from Python. This interface serves as a bridge between Python and VBA, allowing us to send commands, call VBA functions, and access VBA macros. To create an interface, we can use the <strong class="source-inline">excel_app</strong> object obtained from the <span class="No-Break">previous step:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
vba_interface = excel_app.VBE</pre>			<p>You may receive an error along the lines of <em class="italic">Programmatic access to Visual Basic Project is not trusted</em>. In that case, you can look up a solution <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17033526/programmatic-access-to-visual-basic-project-is-not-trusted-from-iis"><span class="No-Break">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17033526/programmatic-access-to-visual-basic-project-is-not-trusted-from-iis</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In the preceding code, we access<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> the <strong class="bold">VBA editor</strong> (<strong class="bold">VBE</strong>) through the <strong class="source-inline">excel_app</strong> object. This grants us access to VBA’s functionalities, including executing VBA code, manipulating modules, and interacting with Excel’s objects <span class="No-Break">from Python.</span></p>
			<p>By <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>following these steps, we can set up the environment to execute VBA code from Python seamlessly. The installation of the <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong> library and the establishment of a connection with Excel create the foundation for executing VBA code and leveraging Excel’s capabilities programmatically. In the next sections, we’ll dive deeper into executing VBA code, interacting with Excel’s objects, and exploring various use cases for i<a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>ntegrating Python <span class="No-Break">and VBA.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Error handling with the environment setup</h2>
			<p>It is<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> possible that the last line of code will give you the <strong class="bold">Project is not trusted</strong> error. As the error suggests, this is because VBA is not trusted in your Excel security settings. To programmatically access VBA, you will need to change the <span class="No-Break">security settings.</span></p>

'''</pre>			<p>After that, rerun the Python code to test that the environment is correctly <span class="No-Break">set up.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have the environment set up, let’s move on to executing VBA code from Python and exploring t<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>he possibilities <span class="No-Break">it offers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Writing and executing VBA code</h2>
			<p>Once the<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> environment is set up, we can dive into the process of writing and executing VBA code from Python. This section will introduce you to different approaches<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> and techniques to interact with Excel, run VBA macros, and retrieve results back <span class="No-Break">into Python.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s explore some of the key aspects of writing and executing <span class="No-Break">VBA code.</span></p>
			<h3>Using the win32com.client module</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">win32com.client</strong> module, provided <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>by the <strong class="source-inline">pywin32</strong> library, offers a convenient <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>way to create a COM interface and interact with Excel from Python. With this module, you can access Excel’s objects, open workbooks, manipulate worksheets, and execute <span class="No-Break">VBA macros.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example that demonstrates how to open an Excel workbook and execute a VBA macro using <strong class="source-inline">win32com.client</strong>. Before running this code, you can ensure <strong class="source-inline">iris_data.xlsm</strong> has the macro by going to <strong class="bold">Developer</strong> | <strong class="bold">Macros</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Visual Basic</strong>) to see that the <span class="No-Break">macro exists:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
import win32com.client as win32
import os
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
path =  os.getcwd().replace('\'','\\') + '\\'
workbook = excel_app.Workbooks.Open(path+"iris_data.xlsm")
excel_app.Run("examplePythonVBA")
workbook.Close(SaveChanges=True)
excel_app.Quit()</pre>			<p>On a related note, here we use the <strong class="source-inline">os</strong> library to handle the working directory and the Windows-specific directory separator to make sure a correct absolute path is used. This was already commented on in previous chapters—either the file has to be in the same folder where Python <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>is running (the working directory) or you need to provide an <span class="No-Break">absolute path.</span></p>
			<p>The code returns nothing as the effect we get is on the Excel side <span class="No-Break">of things:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19142_3_03.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Running the VBA macro from Python"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Running the VBA macro from Python</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> preceding code, we create an instance of the Excel application using <strong class="source-inline">win32.Dispatch</strong> and open a workbook with the <strong class="source-inline">Workbooks.Open</strong> method. We then execute a VBA macro named <strong class="source-inline">examplePythonVBA</strong> using <strong class="source-inline">excel_app.Run</strong>. Finally, we close the workbook, without saving the changes, and quit the <span class="No-Break">Excel application.</span></p>
			<p>The macro simply creates a new sheet with a short message in <span class="No-Break">a cell.</span></p>
			<p>You can open the <strong class="source-inline">.xlsm</strong> workbook after running this code to see that the macro <span class="No-Break">actually worked.</span></p>
			<h3>Interacting with Excel objects</h3>
			<p>With <strong class="source-inline">win32com.client</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>have access to various Excel objects, such as worksheets, ranges, and charts, allowing you to manipulate them programmatically. For example, you can write data to a specific range, format cells, create charts, or perform calculations. Here’s an example that demonstrates how to write data to an Excel worksheet <span class="No-Break">using Python:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import win32com.client as win32
import os
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
path =  os.getcwd().replace('\'','\\') + '\\'
workbook = excel_app.Workbooks.Open(path+"iris_data.xlsm")
worksheet = workbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
for row_index, row_data in enumerate(data, start=1):
for col_index, value in enumerate(row_data, start=1):
worksheet.Cells(row_index, col_index).Value = value
workbook.Close(SaveChanges=True)
excel_app.Quit()</pre>			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> code returns no output <span class="No-Break">if successful:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19142_3_04.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Output for the interacting cells"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Output for the interacting cells</p>
			<p>In the preceding code, we open an Excel workbook, access a specific worksheet named <strong class="bold">Sheet1</strong>, and write data to the cells using the cells’ <strong class="bold">property</strong>. We iterate over the data and set the values in the <span class="No-Break">corresponding cells.</span></p>
			<h3>Retrieving results back into Python</h3>
			<p>After executing VBA code in Excel, you may want to retrieve the results back into Python for further <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>analysis or processing. One way to accomplish this is by using Excel’s object model to access specific values or ranges and retrieve them into <span class="No-Break">Python variables.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example that demonstrates how to retrieve data from an Excel worksheet into a <span class="No-Break">Python list:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import win32com.client as win32
import os
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
path =  os.getcwd().replace('\'','\\') + '\\'
workbook = excel_app.Workbooks.Open(path+"iris_data.xlsm")
worksheet = workbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
# Access multiple cells using Range notation
range_of_cells = worksheet.Range('A1:C3')
# Read the values from the range of cells
values = range_of_cells.Value
workbook.Close(SaveChanges=False)
excel_app.Quit()
print(values)</pre>			<p>The result of the code is a tuple <span class="No-Break">of tuples:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">((1.0, 2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 5.0, 6.0), (7.0, </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">8.0, 9.0))</strong></span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19142_3_05.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Retrieving data from Excel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.5 – Retrieving data from Excel</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> preceding code, we define an Excel range of cells and retrieve their values using the <strong class="source-inline">Value</strong> property. We store the values in a Python list to further process or <span class="No-Break">analyze them.</span></p>
			<p>By leveraging the <strong class="source-inline">win32com.client</strong> module and the Excel object model, you can write and execute VBA code from <span class="No-Break">Python effectively.</span></p>
			<p>The provided code examples illustrate how to interact with Excel, run VBA macros, and retrieve data back into Python for further manipulation. Experiment with these techniques, adapt them to your specific needs, and explore the possibilities of integrating Python and VBA for Excel automation and <span class="No-Break">data processing.</span></p>
