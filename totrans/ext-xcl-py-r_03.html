			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Installing and explaining the RDCOMClient R library</h1>
			<p><code>RDCOMClient</code> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>R package that provides a bridge between R and Microsoft’s <strong class="bold">component object model</strong> (<strong class="bold">COM</strong>) architecture, enabling users to interact with COM objects <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>from within R. With RDCOMClient, users can harness the power of COM-based applications, such as Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook, to automate tasks, manipulate data, and integrate R with other software systems.</p>
			<p>Before diving into RDCOMClient, it’s important to grasp the concept of COM objects. COM is a binary interface standard that allows different software components to interact and share functionality across various programming languages and platforms. In the context of RDCOMClient, COM objects refer to the application-specific objects exposed by COM-based applications that can be accessed and manipulated programmatically.</p>
			<p>RDCOMClient provides a set of functions and methods to interact with COM objects, making it easier to automate tasks and extract data from COM-based applications. Here are<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> some key features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>RDCOMClient</code> allows users to create and connect to COM objects, establishing a communication channel between R and the target application. For instance, you can create an Excel application object and access its functionalities directly from R.</li>
				<li><code>RDCOMClient</code> enables you to invoke methods and retrieve or modify object properties. This functionality allows you to automate complex tasks, manipulate data, and customize application behavior.</li>
				<li><code>RDCOMClient</code>, you can access collections within COM objects, such as workbooks, worksheets, or ranges in Excel. This capability facilitates data extraction, manipulation, and analysis directly from R, leveraging the power of Excel’s built-in features.</li>
				<li><code>RDCOMClient</code> supports event handling, allowing users to respond to<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> events triggered by COM objects. For example, you can write R code that executes whenever a specific event occurs in Excel, such as a cell value change or a worksheet activation.</li>
				<li><code>RDCOMClient</code> provides mechanisms for handling errors that may occur during COM object interactions, ensuring robustness in your code. It also manages memory allocation and cleanup, preventing memory leaks and optimizing resource utilization.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The versatility of <code>RDCOMClient</code> opens <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>up a wide range of applications. Here are a few examples:</p>

			</ul>
			<p><code>RDCOMClient</code> serves as a powerful tool for integrating R with COM-based applications, offering extensive capabilities for automation, data manipulation, and system integration. By bridging the gap between R and the COM architecture, <code>RDCOMClient</code> empowers users to leverage the strengths of both R and various COM applications, opening endless possibilities for enhanced productivity, data analysis, and task automation.</p>
			<p>Now that we have discussed what we can do with RDCOMClient, let’s go through the installation process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Installing RDCOMClient</h2>
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> install packages in R, you would usually type in the command prompt something like <code>install.packages("dplyr")</code> if you wanted to install the <code>dplyr</code> library.</p>
			<p>For the <code>RDCOMClient</code> library, this is going to change a little bit. Typically, if you are using RStudio—your default repository from where you are going to get packages—it is going to default to the Global (CDN) RStudio repository, but for this package, we are going to give some special instructions to the installation command.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">RDCOMClient is only available on Windows.</p>
			<p>Here is how the command will look:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
install.packages(
"RDCOMClient",
repos = "http://www.omegahat.net/R",
type = "win.binary"
)</pre>			<p>Now that<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> we have installed <code>RDCOMClient</code>, we can move on to doing something with it. In the next section, we will go over some examples of how to use it. This library installation can be clunky and, for some, the following will work better:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Install.packages("devtools")
Library(devtools)
Install_github("omegahat/RDCOMClient")</pre>			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Executing sample VBA with RDCOMClient</h1>
			<p>For this<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> execution, the first thing we will need is a new workbook. Let’s call it <code>mult_by_rand_ch3</code>.</p>
			<p>On <code>Record</code> and the other called <code>Value</code>. These columns will simply be the numbers 1 through 10. When that is done, we will need to go ahead and create a simple VBA script to execute from the <code>RDCOMClient</code> library.</p>
			<p>We are going to write a macro that will take the <code>Value</code> column and then multiply the number by a random number using the <code>RAND()</code> function.</p>
			<p>Let’s go over the steps to make the macro and describe how it works. First, take a look at the following VBA code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Sub MultiplyByRandom()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    ' Set the range to the desired range on Sheet1
    Set rng = Sheets("Sheet1").Range("B2:B11")
    ' Loop through each cell in the range
    For Each cell In rng
        ' Multiply the cell value by RAND() and store the result in the adjacent cell
        cell.Offset(0, 1).Value = cell.Value * Rnd()
    Next cell
End Sub</pre>			<p>In order to<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> create this macro, you need to click on the <strong class="bold">Developer</strong> tab or press <em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">F11</em> to open the Visual Basic editor.</p>
			<p>Insert a<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> new module by going to <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> | <strong class="bold">Module</strong>. Once you have done this, you can type the preceding code into the window and close the editor window.</p>
			<p>To get some clarity, let’s go over what each line of the macro does:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Sub MultiplyByRandom()</code>: This line defines the start of a VBA subroutine named <code>MultiplyByRandom</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Dim rng As Range</code> and <code>Dim cell As Range</code>: These lines declare two <code>Range</code> variables named <code>rng</code> and <code>cell</code>. These variables will be used to store ranges and individual cells, respectively.</li>
				<li><code>Set rng = Sheets("Sheet1").Range("B2:B11</code>: This line sets the <code>rng</code> variable to refer to the range of cells from B2 to B11 on <code>Sheet1</code>. It specifies the location where the numbers are stored.</li>
				<li><code>For Each cell In rng</code>: This line starts a loop that will iterate through each cell in the <code>rng</code> range. It assigns the current cell to the <code>cell</code> variable for each iteration of the loop.</li>
				<li><code>cell.Offset(0, 1).Value = cell.Value * Rnd()</code>: This line multiplies the value of the current cell by a randomly generated number using the <code>Rnd()</code> function. It then stores the result in the adjacent cell, which is obtained using the <code>Offset</code> method to shift the reference one column to the right (<code>0</code> rows, <code>1</code> column).</li>
				<li><code>Next cell</code>: This line signifies the end of the loop. It moves the loop to the next cell in the range and repeats the process until all cells have been processed.</li>
				<li><code>End Sub</code>: This line marks the end of the <code>MultiplyByRandom</code> VBA subroutine.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In order<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> to run this macro, we can write the <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>R code that will execute it. We are going to do this with the <code>RDCOMClient</code> library and use the <code>$Run()</code> method from the Excel <code>Workbook</code> object we create.</p>
			<p>Let’s go ahead and write that script now.</p>
			<p>The following is a breakdown of each line in the R code, explained in simple terms.</p>
			<p>This line loads the <code>RDCOMClient</code> library, which provides functionality for interacting with Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Load the library
library(RDCOMClient)</pre>			<p>The following lines define variables for the file path and name of an Excel workbook. They will only work for the author and should be updated to reflect where you are working from. It is possible to be working in a project and use something like <code>paste0(getwd(), "/")</code>. The <code>f_path</code>, <code>f_chapter</code>, and <code>f_name</code> variables specify the directory path, subdirectory name, and filename, respectively. The <code>paste0()</code> function is used to concatenate these variables to create the complete file path:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Set file path
f_path &lt;- "C:/Users/steve/Documents/GitHub/Extending-Excel-with-Python-and-R/"
f_chapter &lt;- "chapter3/"
f_name &lt;- "mult_by_rand_ch3.xlsm"
f &lt;- paste0(f_path, f_chapter, f_name)</pre>			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> next lines create an instance of <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>the Excel application using the <code>COMCreate()</code> function. The <code>xl_app</code> variable represents the Excel application. Then, the specified workbook (<code>f</code>) is opened using the <code>Open()</code> method of the <code>Workbooks()</code> property of the Excel application. Finally, <code>xl_app[['Visible']] &lt;- TRUE</code> sets the visibility of the Excel application to be visible:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Make Excel App
xl_app &lt;- COMCreate("Excel.Application")
xl_wkbk &lt;- xl_app$Workbooks()$Open(f)
xl_app[['Visible']] &lt;- TRUE</pre>			<p>This line assigns the name of the macro to be executed in Excel to the <code>macro_name</code> variable. The macro name is set as <code>MultiplyByRandom</code>:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
macro_name &lt;- "MultiplyByRandom"</pre>			<p>This line executes the <code>MultiplyByRandom</code> macro in the Excel application. The <code>Run()</code> method of the Excel application is used to run the specified macro:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Run the macro
xl_app$Run(macro_name)</pre>			<p>These lines save the workbook and close it using the <code>close()</code> method of the <code>xl_wkbk</code> workbook object. The <code>TRUE</code> argument indicates that the changes should be saved before closing. Finally, the <code>Quit()</code> method of the <code>xl_app</code> Excel application is used to close the Excel application:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Save and Quit
xl_wkbk$close(TRUE); xl_app$Quit()</pre>			<p>In summary, the code opens an Excel workbook using <code>RDCOMClient</code>, runs a macro named <code>MultiplyByRandom</code> in the workbook, saves the changes, and closes the workbook and the Excel application.</p>
			<p>Let’s have a look at how this <a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>works in Python!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Integrating VBA with Python using pywin32</h1>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>section, we will dive into executing VBA code from Python, exploring the seamless integration between the two languages and the immense possibilities it unlocks for automating Excel tasks, extending functionality, and leveraging Excel’s power within Python workflows.</p>
			<p>This section will cover the motivation to work with VBA from Python, how to set up the environment on Windows, and how to write and execute VBA co<a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>de. Let’s dig in.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Why execute VBA code from Python?</h2>
			<p>Before delving into the details, let’s explore why executing VBA code from Python can be highly beneficial.</p>
			<p>Excel, with<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> its extensive set of features and capabilities, serves as a vital tool for data analysis, reporting, and automation. However, Excel’s built-in functionality may sometimes fall short when dealing with complex data manipulations or advanced calculations.

By integrating Python with Excel through VBA, you can bridge the gap between these two worlds, allowing data analysts, developers, and Excel power users to collaborate and benefit from each other’s expertise.</p>
			<p>In summary, executing VBA code from Python empowers you to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Leverage Python’s extensive libraries and tools for data analysis and manipulation</li>
				<li>Automate repetitive tasks and build custom Excel applications using VBA</li>
				<li>Perform complex calculations, data transformations, and statistical analysis with Python’s powerful ecosystem</li>
				<li>Extend Excel’s functionality using Python’s versatility and access external data sources and APIs</li>
				<li>Collaborate and share code between Python data analysts, developers, and Excel power users</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The integration of Python and VBA enables you to unlock the full potential of Excel, leverage the strengths of both languages, and take your data analysis, reporting, and automation skills to new heights.</p>
			<p>Let’s proceed to set up the environment for executing VB<a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>A code from Python.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Setting up the environment</h2>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>successfully execute VBA code from Python, we need to set up the environment by installing the required dependencies and configuring the necessary connections. This section will walk you through the steps to ensure a smooth setup process in three easy steps.</p>
			<h3>Installing the pywin32 library</h3>
			<p>The <code>pywin32</code> library<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> serves as a bridge between Python and the Windows API and COM objects. It<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> enables Python to interact with Excel’s object model and execute VBA code.</p>
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> install <code>pywin32</code>, you can use a package manager such as <code>pip</code> by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:</p>
			<pre class="console">
python –m pip install pywin32==306</pre>			<p>Here is how it runs:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19142_3_01.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Installing pywin32 on Windows with pip"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Installing pywin32 on Windows with pip</p>
			<p>This will install the <code>pywin32</code> package and its dependencies, allowing Python to communicate with Excel.</p>
			<h3>Establishing a connection with Excel</h3>
			<p>Once <code>pywin32</code> is<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> installed, we can establish a connection with Excel from Python. This connection allows us to access Excel’s workbooks, worksheets, ranges, and other Excel-specific functionalities programmatically.</p>
			<p>To establish a connection, we can make use of the <code>win32com.client</code> module provided by <code>pywin32</code>. Here’s an example of how to create a connection with Excel:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import win32com.client as win32
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")</pre>			<p>If the environment is set up correctly, this code returns nothing. However, if the code returns <code>com_error</code>, please go to the <em class="italic">Error handling with the environmental </em><em class="italic">setup</em> section.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19142_3_02.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Testing the connection to Excel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Testing the connection to Excel</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> preceding code snippet, we imported the <code>win32com.client</code> module and created a new instance of the Excel application using the <code>win32.Dispatch</code> method. This creates a connection between Python and Excel, allowing us to interact with Excel’s objects and execute VBA code.</p>
			<h3>Creating an interface to interact with VBA code</h3>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>connection established, we can create an interface that enables us to execute VBA code from Python. This interface serves as a bridge between Python and VBA, allowing us to send commands, call VBA functions, and access VBA macros. To create an interface, we can use the <code>excel_app</code> object obtained from the previous step:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
vba_interface = excel_app.VBE</pre>			<p>You may receive an error along the lines of <em class="italic">Programmatic access to Visual Basic Project is not trusted</em>. In that case, you can look up a solution at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17033526/programmatic-access-to-visual-basic-project-is-not-trusted-from-iis">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17033526/programmatic-access-to-visual-basic-project-is-not-trusted-from-iis</a>.</p>
			<p>In the preceding code, we access<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> the <code>excel_app</code> object. This grants us access to VBA’s functionalities, including executing VBA code, manipulating modules, and interacting with Excel’s objects from Python.</p>
			<p>By <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>following these steps, we can set up the environment to execute VBA code from Python seamlessly. The installation of the <code>pywin32</code> library and the establishment of a connection with Excel create the foundation for executing VBA code and leveraging Excel’s capabilities programmatically. In the next sections, we’ll dive deeper into executing VBA code, interacting with Excel’s objects, and exploring various use cases for i<a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>ntegrating Python and VBA.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Error handling with the environment setup</h2>
			<p>It is<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> possible that the last line of code will give you the <strong class="bold">Project is not trusted</strong> error. As the error suggests, this is because VBA is not trusted in your Excel security settings. To programmatically access VBA, you will need to change the security settings.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">This has security consequences beyond the scope of this book, so only change the settings if you are OK with the risks.</p>
			<p>To change the security settings, you will need to create a new key in the registry and add a new property to it by running PowerShell as administrator. Run the following code:</p>
			<pre class="console">
 New-Item -path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\ -Name "Security"
Set-ItemProperty -path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\Security -Name "AccessVBOM" -Value 1
'''</pre>			<p>After that, rerun the Python code to test that the environment is correctly set up.</p>
			<p>Now that we have the environment set up, let’s move on to executing VBA code from Python and exploring t<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>he possibilities it offers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Writing and executing VBA code</h2>
			<p>Once the<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> environment is set up, we can dive into the process of writing and executing VBA code from Python. This section will introduce you to different approaches<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> and techniques to interact with Excel, run VBA macros, and retrieve results back into Python.</p>
			<p>Let’s explore some of the key aspects of writing and executing VBA code.</p>
			<h3>Using the win32com.client module</h3>
			<p>The <code>win32com.client</code> module, provided <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>by the <code>pywin32</code> library, offers a convenient <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>way to create a COM interface and interact with Excel from Python. With this module, you can access Excel’s objects, open workbooks, manipulate worksheets, and execute VBA macros.</p>
			<p>Here’s an example that demonstrates how to open an Excel workbook and execute a VBA macro using <code>win32com.client</code>. Before running this code, you can ensure <code>iris_data.xlsm</code> has the macro by going to <strong class="bold">Developer</strong> | <strong class="bold">Macros</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Visual Basic</strong>) to see that the macro exists:</p>
			<pre class="console">
import win32com.client as win32
import os
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
path =  os.getcwd().replace('\'','\\') + '\\'
workbook = excel_app.Workbooks.Open(path+"iris_data.xlsm")
excel_app.Run("examplePythonVBA")
workbook.Close(SaveChanges=True)
excel_app.Quit()</pre>			<p>On a related note, here we use the <code>os</code> library to handle the working directory and the Windows-specific directory separator to make sure a correct absolute path is used. This was already commented on in previous chapters—either the file has to be in the same folder where Python <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>is running (the working directory) or you need to provide an absolute path.</p>
			<p>The code returns nothing as the effect we get is on the Excel side of things:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19142_3_03.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Running the VBA macro from Python"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Running the VBA macro from Python</p>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> preceding code, we create an instance of the Excel application using <code>win32.Dispatch</code> and open a workbook with the <code>Workbooks.Open</code> method. We then execute a VBA macro named <code>examplePythonVBA</code> using <code>excel_app.Run</code>. Finally, we close the workbook, without saving the changes, and quit the Excel application.</p>
			<p>The macro simply creates a new sheet with a short message in a cell.</p>
			<p>You can open the <code>.xlsm</code> workbook after running this code to see that the macro actually worked.</p>
			<h3>Interacting with Excel objects</h3>
			<p>With <code>win32com.client</code>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>have access to various Excel objects, such as worksheets, ranges, and charts, allowing you to manipulate them programmatically. For example, you can write data to a specific range, format cells, create charts, or perform calculations. Here’s an example that demonstrates how to write data to an Excel worksheet using Python:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import win32com.client as win32
import os
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
path =  os.getcwd().replace('\'','\\') + '\\'
workbook = excel_app.Workbooks.Open(path+"iris_data.xlsm")
worksheet = workbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
for row_index, row_data in enumerate(data, start=1):
for col_index, value in enumerate(row_data, start=1):
worksheet.Cells(row_index, col_index).Value = value
workbook.Close(SaveChanges=True)
excel_app.Quit()</pre>			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> code returns no output if successful:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19142_3_04.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Output for the interacting cells"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Output for the interacting cells</p>
			<p>In the preceding code, we open an Excel workbook, access a specific worksheet named <strong class="bold">Sheet1</strong>, and write data to the cells using the cells’ <strong class="bold">property</strong>. We iterate over the data and set the values in the corresponding cells.</p>
			<h3>Retrieving results back into Python</h3>
			<p>After executing VBA code in Excel, you may want to retrieve the results back into Python for further <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>analysis or processing. One way to accomplish this is by using Excel’s object model to access specific values or ranges and retrieve them into Python variables.</p>
			<p>Here’s an example that demonstrates how to retrieve data from an Excel worksheet into a Python list:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import win32com.client as win32
import os
excel_app = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
path =  os.getcwd().replace('\'','\\') + '\\'
workbook = excel_app.Workbooks.Open(path+"iris_data.xlsm")
worksheet = workbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
# Access multiple cells using Range notation
range_of_cells = worksheet.Range('A1:C3')
# Read the values from the range of cells
values = range_of_cells.Value
workbook.Close(SaveChanges=False)
excel_app.Quit()
