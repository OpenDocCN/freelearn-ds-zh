<p>ArcGIS Online is Esri’s GIS cloud solution. It allows you and your organization to easily share data, maps, tools, and applications that can then be accessed via the internet. Prior to ArcGIS Online, you were required to have a dedicated GIS web server, such as ArcGIS Server, to provide web-based content to your users.</p>
<p>So, what is a cloud solution? The word Cloud is used a lot nowadays, but few really know what it is. Simply put, a cloud solution is one that leverages the internet to deliver a product. This can be in the form of hardware (servers), platforms (Windows, iOS, Linux), or software (Microsoft 365, Constant Contact, Salesforce).</p>
<p>ArcGIS Online is an example of <strong>Software as a Solution</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1001 image-border" height="851" src="assets/0861de4d-0321-4d48-a2ba-f9433d882c1a.png" width="1080"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Example of an ArcGIS Online web portal</div>
<p>As a SaaS, ArcGIS Online provides the necessary tools to create interactive maps and apps, share and manage data, and integrate with other ArcGIS applications or other vendor solutions. ArcGIS Online also provides security that controls who can access your data. Like you own local network, ArcGIS Online requires users to log in to create, modify, or upload content. When you publish content in ArcGIS Online, you get to choose who you share it with. You can choose to share it with no one, which means only you can access it. You can opt to share it with the members of your organization, with part of a specific group, or you can choose to share content with everyone. This all assumes you are a Level 2 user. ArcGIS Online can even be integrated with your own local network security and logins.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Online supports two user levels, Level 1 and Level 2. Level 1 users are allowed to access and view content. So, they could view data shared via a web app with those in the organization or open a mobile application that allows them to view and query data. Level 1 users are not allowed to create, modify, upload, or share content. Those functions require you to be a Level 2 user.</p>
<p>Level 2 users are permitted much greater access to ArcGIS Online content than Level 1. Their access and capabilities are determined by the role assigned to their username. ArcGIS includes four basic user roles: viewer, user, publisher, and administrator. Each of these roles builds on the capabilities of the previous one. The view role limits the user to view only. So, they would be limited to the same basic access as a Level 1 user. The user role allows the user to edit features, add items, and share content. The publisher role allows users to publish hosted web maps as well as analyze the performance of layers in a web map. Administrators have the ability to manage other users, configure organizational settings, and manage ArcGIS Pro licenses.  You can also create custom roles that mix and match the capabilities of the four primary roles. To learn more about the different ArcGIS Online user roles, go to <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/roles.htm">http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/roles.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Doing things in ArcGIS Online costs credits. Most things that you do in ArcGIS Online cost some amount of credits. This includes storing data, hosting applications, and using ArcGIS Online services. Some things cost very few credits, such as storing data. It only costs about 1.2 credits per month per 1 GB of data stored in ArcGIS Online. Other functions cost more, such as geocoding or reporting. It costs 40 credits per 1,000 addresses you geocode. To learn more about credits and how they work, go to <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/credits.htm">http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/credits.htm</a>. Credits are fairly cheap. You can get 1,000 credits for only $100.00.</p>
<p>Each license of ArcGIS Pro includes one Level 2 ArcGIS Online user and 100 credits. The ArcGIS Pro license level does not matter. If an organization (that is, business, agency, governmental unit) is the owner of the licenses, then they are combined. So if a City were to have three licenses of ArcGIS Pro, they would then get three level 2 users and 300 credits. These would be renewed each year, as long as the ArcGIS Pro licenses software maintenance is renewed.</p>
<p>There are some things that do not cost credits when using ArcGIS Online and its content. Here is a list of some of the things that do not cost ArcGIS Online credits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making use of the Esri basemaps</li>
<li>Uploading and downloading data</li>
<li>Adding and using services from your own GIS server</li>
<li>Simple viewing, querying, and printing of web maps by users</li>
<li>Geocoding a single address</li>
<li>Logging in to your account</li>
<li>Managing your ArcGIS Online users or software licenses</li>
<li>Viewing your organization's ArcGIS Online usage</li>
<li>Configuring your ArcGIS Online account and organization</li>
</ul>
<p>ArcGIS Pro is heavily integrated with ArcGIS Online. Within ArcGIS Pro, you can easily access a wealth of data, maps, and other services that expand the capabilities of your GIS. You will also find that much of the workflow between the two is very similar. This makes it much easier for users to shift back and forth between the two solutions.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will get an opportunity to explore ArcGIS Online and see how it is integrated with ArcGIS Pro. You will start by exploring your access to ArcGIS Online. You will learn how to log in to your account and begin accessing content.  Then, you will learn how to create a very simple web map using existing ArcGIS Online data. Next, you will explore ArcGIS Online’s integration with ArcGIS Pro. You will learn how you bring data layers from ArcGIS Online into your own maps. Then, you will learn how to access demographic information from ArcGIS Online. Lastly, you will learn how to access some of the geoprocessing tools from ArcGIS Online.  </p>

<p>As mentioned previously, ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based solution. This means it is part of the web, so you access it just as you would any other web resource, using your web browser.  This means you can access your ArcGIS Online account and content just about anywhere that you have an internet connection. It also means you can use a multitude of devices to access it. This includes not just your desktop computer or laptop, but also your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to log in and access your ArcGIS Online account. You will explore what resources might be available to you.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open your favorite web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.arcgis.com">www.arcgis.com</a>. This is the web address for ArcGIS Online. When the site loads, it should look similar to this. Note that because ArcGIS Online is cloud-based, Esri often makes updates and changes:</li>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>A couple of things to note on the Sign In page. First, ArcGIS Online also supports free public accounts. These accounts are limited on the functionality you can use. They only allow you to store up to 2 GB of data. They also have a limited ability to share content. Basically, you either share it with everybody or nobody.</p>
<p>Also note, you can integrate ArcGIS Online with your network login, or you can use your Facebook or Google login.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to log in to your ArcGIS Online account and add some content, it is time to expand upon that skill and learn how to create a simple web map using publicly-available content. ArcGIS Online contains a wealth of data, provided not only by Esri but also by other users, that you are allowed to access and use freely. This sharing of information is one of the reasons ArcGIS Online can be a very valuable resource.</p>
<p>Creating a map in ArcGIS Online is very similar to creating one in ArcGIS Pro. First, you start a new map. Then, you select your basemap. Next, you start adding layers and configuring them. Then, you save your map. So, as you can see, the steps are very similar. </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a simple web map for the City of Trippville. This will include a couple of simple layers such as City Limits, Roads, and Natural Water Features.    </p>

<p>This recipe requires that you have an ArcGIS Online account with at least a Publisher-level role assigned. You will also need internet access along with a web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript. You need to have completed the first recipe in this chapter to ensure you know how to access and log in to your ArcGIS Online account.  </p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro is not required to complete this exercise.</p>

<p>You are not limited to the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer for accessing all the content available in ArcGIS Online. You can also access it from ArcGIS Pro, as well as ArcMap and other Esri applications. As a matter of fact, you have already been accessing ArcGIS Online content in the form of the basemaps that have been a part of every map and scene you have created. All of those are served by Esri through ArcGIS Online.</p>
<p>In this recipe, the Emergency Management Director has asked you to prepare a map that could be used in the event of an impending weather event. It will need to include weather radar information as well as weather warnings. This will need to overlay the GIS information the city already has so other ArcGIS Pro users can monitor weather events as they develop.  </p>

<li>Start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>ArcGISOnline.aprx</kbd> project. This project is located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter12\ArcGISOnline</kbd>. This project should open with the <span class="packt_screen">Weather Response</span> map visible, as shown in the following screenshot. If not, open it from the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane using skills you have learned in past recipes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7fa13b3f-96c8-4bd4-b60c-a1b7a0b8a3de.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Weather Response map which should display when ArcGISOnline project is open</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, this is a simple map that contains the City Limits and Parcels for the Trippville area. This information is coming from the same Trippville_GIS geodatabase you have used in past recipes. Now you will add some data layers from ArcGIS Online.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, click the <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span> tab.</li>
<li>Now click the <span class="packt_screen">All Portals</span> button. It looks like a simple cloud. It should be the third button from the left. This will allow you to access ArcGIS Online content that is being shared with all users.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Search</span> cell, type <kbd>Weather</kbd>. This should return many listings for data in ArcGIS Online that you can access that has been tagged with the Weather keyword.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Recent Weather Radar Imagery Service</span>. Then right-click it and select <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span>. This will add a layer to your map from ArcGIS online that shows the weather radar. Depending on the current weather around the Trippville area, this may show nothing or a lot of activity. This is a live feed from the <strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</strong> (<strong>NOAA</strong>).</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, locate the <span class="packt_screen">NOAA NWS Warnings</span> and add it to your map using the same process as before. Again, this is a live feed from NOAA, so depending on the weather at the time you add this layer, it may also appear empty.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have added two layers to your ArcGIS Pro map from ArcGIS Online. These two layers will provide basic weather information during a major weather event for the City of Trippville.  These are national-level layers. Let’s incorporate some more content that comes from other sources.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, change your search to <kbd>Georgia Weather</kbd>. Remember to press the <em>Enter</em> key when you type the new value.</li>
<li>Scroll down and locate the <span class="packt_screen">NWS_Local_Storm_Reports</span> and add it to your map. This is a data feed that comes from the State of Georgia Emergency Management Agency. This will provide you with local information for the City of Trippville during a weather emergency.</li>
<li>Change your search to <kbd>Georgia Rivers and Streams</kbd> in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane.</li>
<li>Scroll down and locate the <span class="packt_screen">Rivers Streams Atlanta Region</span>. Add this data to your map, as you have with the other layers.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, click the <span class="packt_screen">List by Source</span> button then answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Q</strong><span><strong>uestion</strong>: </span>What is the origin of each layer in the map?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong><span><strong>uestion</strong>: </span>Are all these layers being stored/hosted in ArcGIS Online?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your map now contains data from multiple sources. You have layers that reference your local Trippville_GIS geodatabase. You have several layers that are published to ArcGIS Online from multiple agencies including NOAA, GEMA, and the Atlanta Regional Commission. However, not all of these are stored directly in ArcGIS Online. The only layer that is actually stored in ArcGIS Online is the basemap. All the others are being published to ArcGIS Online via their own local GIS server.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">ArcGIS Online provides the conduit to allow others to easily access the data. So, as you can see, ArcGIS Online provides a great resource for sharing information between multiple agencies and jurisdictions.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Explore some of the limits of the layers you added from ArcGIS Online. Click the <span class="packt_screen">List by Drawing Order</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane.</li>
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">SDEPUB.SDE.Rivers_Streams</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span> from the menu presented.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> option in the left panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Properties</span> window.</li>
<li>Change the name to <kbd>Rivers &amp; Streams</kbd>.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Metadata</span> option in the left panel. Review the <span class="packt_screen">Metadata</span> and answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Q</strong><span><strong>uestion</strong>: </span>Who developed the data for this layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong><span><strong>uestion</strong>: </span>What was the original source from which the data was captured? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Q</strong><span><strong>uestion</strong>: </span>What was the date for the captured data?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></span></p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, the metadata provides a wealth of information about the data in this layer. This is why it is important to create and maintain your metadata when you share that information with others. It allows them to know the who, what, when, why, and how of the data so the user can make educated choices about how to use the data.</p>

</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can now see, this layer’s symbology is preconfigured as part of the service. You should have also noticed that the list of properties was much shorter than those available for the Rivers and Streams layer. This is because the Local Storm Reports from the GEMA layer is referencing an ArcGIS map service that is a type of raster service. As a user, you have a limited ability to change or adjust the display settings for an ArcGIS Map Service.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>When you publish data to the web, be it through ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Server, or ArcGIS Enterprise, you have to choose what type of service you will publish. The basic types of web services you can publish include Map, Feature, Geocoding, Geodatabase, Geometry, Geoprocessing, Image, and Network analysis services.  Each of these has its own unique capabilities.

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Another useful integration between ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online is the ability to access some simple demographic data <span>that </span>Esri publishes via their GeoEnrichment service. This data is accessed via the Infographics tool on the Map tab.</p>
<p>This tool presents the data as a series of graphs, tables, and reports. It can help you answer several questions about the area you are working in, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the average income level?</li>
<li>What is the total population?</li>
<li>How diverse is the population?</li>
<li>What is the age demographic breakdown for the area?</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of information, level of detail, and scale available will depend on where you are working in the world. Esri maintains a large collection of demographic data, however it is not always 100% complete. To find out what data is available for a given region or area, go to <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/EN/ESRI-DEMOGRAPHICS/DATA/DATA.HTM">http://doc.arcgis.com/EN/ESRI-DEMOGRAPHICS/DATA/DATA.HTM</a>.</p>
<p>Using the Infographics tool does cost credits. So, each time you click in the map or scene while using the Infographics tool, you will use up a portion of a credit. This cost per use is very small. You will use up 10 credits per 1,000 views or clicks. So, each click only uses 0.01 credits. However, you should always keep this in mind when accessing ArcGIS Online-based functionality.</p>
<p>In this recipe you, will examine the Infographics tool. You will learn how to use and configure it to get the information you need.  </p>

<p>You must have completed the other recipes in this chapter before starting this one. This will ensure <span>that </span>you have a stronger foundational understanding of ArcGIS Online and how it is linked to ArcGIS Pro. You will also need to ensure the sample data is installed before you continue.  </p>
<p>This recipe, like the others in this chapter, will require you to have an ArcGIS Online user account. Any user level and role should allow you to complete this recipe. This recipe will use up some of your ArcGIS Online credits. The amount should be very small, under one credit in most cases.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">Much of the data retrieved by the Infographics tool in the United States starts with the US Census Bureau. Esri then extrapolates that information along with other sources to develop a more in-depth level of data that is useful in predicting growth, placement of new facilities, and more. Most countries have similar agencies that monitor population and other demographic makeup.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane. Select <span class="packt_screen">Zoom to Layer</span> from the menu that appears. Your map should zoom to show the full extent of the City Limits layer, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>

<li>Activate the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the ribbon if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">First, let’s learn how to configure settings for the Infographics tool. This will help ensure the data you need to see is displayed.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Click the drop-down arrow located below the <span class="packt_screen">Infographics</span> button and select <span class="packt_screen">Configure Infographics</span>. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Configure Infographics</span> window, as shown here:</li>

<ol start="15">
<li>Take a moment to notice the basic options you can configure. First, you choose the country you want to explore. For this recipe, set it to <span class="packt_screen">Show available data for: United States</span> using the drop-down arrow if needed.</li>
<li>If desired, you can change the color theme. The default is Light.</li>
<li>Notice the data collection that is available by default and answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What are the six default data collections which are available with the tool?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Infographics tool provides you with access to six different data collections by default. You can control which of these you see by clicking the check boxes to enable or disable those collections. You can also access settings and data by clicking <span class="packt_screen">Add more variables</span>. This allows you to further refine the data you see presented in the Infographics tool.</p>
</div>
<ol start="18">
<li>You can control the area <span>that </span>the tool analyzes. Notice, by default, it is based off a ring distance to start. Click the drop-down for <span class="packt_screen">Show data for:</span> to see what other options are available. Leave it set to <span class="packt_screen">Ring</span>.</li>
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> to close the <span class="packt_screen">Configure Infographics</span> window.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now you will put the tool into action.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Infographics</span> tool located on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Inquiry</span> group.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="21">
<li>Click at any point within the City Limits of Trippville. The <span class="packt_screen">Infographics</span> window should then appear, as illustrated in the following screenshot. Your window may look different depending on how your tool is configured and if you have ever used it before.</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9bbfd978-c29f-47bd-8912-99cd5a12acca.png"/></div>
<ol start="22">
<li>In the upper-left corner of the window, you should see a value with a drop-down arrow. This controls what is displayed in the window. If needed, click the drop-down arrow, as illustrated in the following image, and select <span class="packt_screen">Age Pyramid</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1013 image-border" height="284" src="assets/014b7a35-d4cc-4edd-b87b-94bc688c83be.png" width="413"/></div>
<ol start="23">
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Dots show comparison to</span> option is set to <span class="packt_screen">Cobb County</span> using the drop-down arrow. It is located in the lower-right corner of the <span class="packt_screen">Infographics</span> window.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now, your <span class="packt_screen">Infographics</span> window should look very similar to all the graphics you have seen so far. The Infographics tool can be configured to show different information. We will explore that later. For now, let's continue to examine what information is available out of the box with the default configuration.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Change the <span class="packt_screen">Dots show comparison to</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Cobb County</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Georgia</span>. Notice how the graph changes.</li>
<li>Change it to the <span class="packt_screen">United States</span> now and watch the graph to notice the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Each time you adjust the level at which the tool compares, the graph changes. The colored bars represent the data for the area you clicked. The line with the circles represents the values for the comparison (that is, Cobb County, Georgia, or United States). Now let’s look at some other options.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Where you clicked the drop-down arrow to change the window to the <span class="packt_screen">Age Pyramid</span>, click it again and select <span class="packt_screen">Households by Income</span>.  This will display a different graph that shows the percent of households within different income brackets and how the area you clicked compares to the larger area defined by the Bars show deviation from option in the lower-right corner.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>You can also use the small arrows located on the right and left side of the Infographics window to change what data is displayed. This does the same as the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner.</p>
</div>
<ol start="27">
<li>Try some of the other data and comparison options.</li>
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Infographics</span> window once you are done exploring the data options that can be displayed.</li>
<li>Save your project.</li>
<li>If you are continuing to the next recipe, you may keep ArcGIS Pro open. If you are not, you may close it.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have now seen how you can access very simple but informative demographic information using the Infographics tool. ArcGIS Pro allows you to customize this tool so you display the information you need to get the answers you are looking for, using the Infographics Configuration window. This is just a small subset of data <span>that </span>Esri has in its library. If you want access to more detailed and refined demographic data, you may want to investigate the ArcGIS Business Analyst (<a href="http://www.esri.com/software/businessanalyst">http://www.esri.com/software/businessanalyst</a>) and Community Analyst (<a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/community-analyst">http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/community-analyst</a>).</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>ArcGIS Online is more than just data and maps. It also contains powerful analysis or geoprocessing tools as well. These tools can allow you to perform analysis that would normally require you to have an extension, such as calculate service areas, determine watersheds, and create elevation profiles.</p>
<p>As mentioned, those types of analysis typically require an extension. For example, to calculate a service area, you would need the Network Analyst extension. However with ArcGIS Pro, you can access this functionality as a ready-to-use tool without an extension. These ready-to-use tools do use credits, and typically more credits than the Infographics tool. The amount of credits used by each tool is determined by a base level for the tool plus the additional options you select that add complexity to the analysis. For example, if you needed to calculate a service area based on a simple driving distance that would use less credits than one that was based on driving time, during a specified time period, that also took one-way streets and weight limits into account and avoided toll roads.</p>
<p>While these tools do use credits, they may still be a cheaper option than getting one of the Esri ArcGIS Extensions. The list price for an ArcGIS Extension is $2,500.00 for a single license of one extension, whereas the credits required for each analysis is a fraction of that number. So, unless you also need to create the data used in the analysis and maintain it, then ArcGIS Online tools may be a more sustainable financial option for you to consider.  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you are working for a GIS Consulting company. You have been assigned a new client that is a concrete provider. They have several plants located throughout Georgia. They need you to calculate the service area for each plant based on an estimated one-hour drive time. That is the upper limit of time before the concrete in the delivery trucks start to become unusable.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you complete the other recipes in this chapter, along with those in <a href="45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology</em>, to ensure you have the needed foundational understanding of the topics and basic workflows used in this recipe. You will also need to ensure the sample data is installed before you continue, and you have an ArcGIS Online user account with permissions to use credits. You will also need internet access to complete this recipe.   </p>
<p>This recipe will require you to use some of your ArcGIS online credits. It is estimated that this recipe should take about two credits or fewer to complete.</p>

<li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro when you completed the previous recipe, start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>ArcGISOnline</kbd> project you used in the previous recipes in this chapter. This project should be included in your list of recently opened projects.</li>
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Demographics</span> map you were working with in the previous recipe, and open the <span class="packt_screen">Corbin Concrete</span> map from the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane. The new map should open with a layer showing the locations of the seven concrete plants belonging to Corbin Concrete, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Map showing location of Corbin Concrete plants</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you can see the locations of the concrete plants, you need to calculate service areas for each plant based on a one-hour drive time. Traditionally, to do this you would need the Network Analyst extension and a road network dataset. Since this is a new client that has never used or had GIS, you do not have any of this data specifically for them. Luckily, with the ArcGIS Online ready-to-use tools, you do not need that. All you need is access to ArcGIS Online and a few credits to run the analysis.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Ready to Use Tools</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> group and select <span class="packt_screen">Generate Service Areas</span>, as illustrated in the following graphic. This tool is accessing a geoprocessing service from ArcGIS Online:</li>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Accessing the ready to use Generate Service Areas tool</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Facilities</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Concrete Plants</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Break Values</span> to <kbd>1</kbd> by typing the number in to replace the default values.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Break Units</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Hours</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Accept the default <span class="packt_screen">Travel Mode</span> of <kbd>Custom</kbd>. By default, this mode assumes you are traveling by vehicle and will automatically avoid private roads, unpaved roads, and a few other types of traffic items. Later, you will investigate those settings and make adjustments.</li>
<li>Verify that your <span class="packt_screen">GenerateServiceAreas</span> tool looks like the following and click <span class="packt_screen">Run</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014 image-border" height="321" src="assets/6f07e692-50f8-430c-b00a-31562e4556d6.png" width="460"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Depending on your internet connection speed and your computer specs, this tool may take several minutes to complete.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When the GenerateServiceAreas tool completes, a new layer will appear in your map. This new area shows the service area for each plant based on an estimated one-hour drive time, which should look something like the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/58786ae8-a234-4821-a5cc-f34e3e2dba49.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The client appreciates your efforts and thinks this is useful information. However, they now want to make a few adjustments to your analysis. Given that one hour is the maximum time for the concrete before it starts to become unusable, they want to build in a 15 minutes safety margin. So the new time will be 45 minutes instead of one hour. They also want to make sure the calculation avoids toll roads and restricted roads, as well as roads with height restrictions and weight restrictions. You will need to run the analysis again with the new parameters.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Service Areas</span> layer that was just added to your map and select <span class="packt_screen">Remove</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">GenerateServiceAreas</span> tool, set the following parameters:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Accept the default values for all other parameters.</li>
<li>Once you have configured all the restrictions, click <span class="packt_screen">Run</span>. Again, the tool may take several minutes to run due to the complexity of the analysis you are asking it to perform.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Once again, a new layer will appear in your map. This represents the new service areas you just created with the shorter drive time and additional restrictions. To make the map and data easier to understand, you will now make some adjustments to the layer and its symbology.</p>

<div class="packt_tip">
<p>When you click the drop-down arrow to see the list of available color ramps, if you look at the bottom of the list, you will see some options. One of them will display the name of each color ramp. You may need to enable that option to ensure you select the correct one.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You have now created a map that shows the location of each concrete plant along with the associated service area for that plant. Now the dispatchers for Corbin Concrete will know what areas they can provide concrete to and which plant, or plants, will be the best choice to send the trucks from.
