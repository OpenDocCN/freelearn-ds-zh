- en: Python has become the language of choice for many in the geospatial industry.
    Some use Python as a way to automate their workflows in software, such as ArcGIS
    or QGIS. Others play around with the nuts and bolts of Python's immense variety
    of third-party open source geospatial toolkits.

- en: Given all the programming tools available and the people already familiar with
    geospatial software, there is no reason why you should have to choose either one
    or the other. Programmers can now develop their own applications from scratch
    to better suit their needs. Python is, after all, known as a language for rapid
    development.

- en: By developing your own application, you can have fun with it, experiment with
    new visual layouts and creative designs, create platforms for specialized workflows,
    and tailor to the needs of others.

- en: There are no real requirements for this book. However, to keep the book short
    and sweet, the instructions assume that you have a Windows operating system. If
    you are on Mac OS X or Linux, you should still be able create and run the application,
    but then you will have to figure out the equivalent installation instructions
    for your operating system. You may be forced to deal with compiling C++ code and
    face the potential of unexpected errors. All other installations will be covered
    throughout the book, including which Python version to use.

- en: This book is ideal for Python programmers and software developers who are tasked
    with or wish to make a customizable special-purpose GIS application, or are interested
    in expanding their knowledge of working with spatial data cleaning, analysis,
    or map visualization. Analysts, political scientists, geographers, and GIS specialists
    seeking a creative platform to experiment with cutting-edge spatial analysis,
    but are still only beginners in Python, will also find this book beneficial. Familiarity
    with Tkinter application development in Python is preferable but not mandatory.
