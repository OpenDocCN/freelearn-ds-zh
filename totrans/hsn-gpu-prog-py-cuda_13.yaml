    to each other; we can thus parallelize over these two `for` loops. The third `for`
    loop calculates the final value of a particular pixel, which is intrinsically

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 512 x 512 amounts to 262,144 pixels. This means that the first GPU can only
    calculate the outputs of half of the pixels at once, while the second GPU can
    calculate all of the pixels at once; this means the second GPU will be about twice
    as fast as the first here. The third GPU has more than sufficient cores to calculate
    all pixels at once, but as we saw in problem 1, the extra cores will be of no
    use to us here. So the second and third GPUs will be equally fast for this problem.

- en: One issue with generically designating a certain segment of code as parallelizable
    with regards to Amdahl's Law is that this makes the assumption that the computation
    time for this piece of code will be close to 0 if the number of processors, *N*,
    is very large. As we can see from the last problem, this is not the case.

    on the bottlenecks of your program. Second, a profiler can tell you the exact
    computation time of all of your code from the perspective of Python, so you can
    tell whether some library function or background activity of your operating system
    is at fault rather than your code.
