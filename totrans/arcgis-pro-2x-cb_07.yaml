- en: As you may have noticed by now, GIS data comes in many formats. There are geodatabases,
    shapefiles, CAD files, DBF files, rasters, spreadsheets, and more. ArcGIS Pro
    allows you to use all of these. However, there are limits to what ArcGIS Pro allows
    you to do with some of these formats. Some of these are read only, such as CAD
    files or spreadsheets. Others you can read and edit, such as shapefiles and geodatabases.
    Also, if you have data spread across multiple locations, formats, and files, it
    can make it difficult to use.

    consolidate all the required data into a single format. For ArcGIS Pro, the primary
    storage format is the geodatabase. Shapefiles are generally considered a secondary
    option. In order to consolidate your data sources, you may need to convert and
    combine data from one or more sources into a single source. ArcGIS Pro provides
    several methods and tools to accomplish this. Which one works best will depend
    on several factors, including:'

    how to convert a simple shapefile into a new geodatabase feature class. Then you

    your career in GIS. Just about every GIS-enabled application can read, import,
    export, and edit a shapefile. This includes applications such as QGIS, AutoCAD
    Map 3D, Civil 3D, Geomedia, and many others. This has resulted in shapefiles becoming
    a common format for sharing GIS data with multiple platforms. It is not uncommon
    to receive data from engineering, planning, and surveying firms in a shapefile
    format.

    multiple shapefiles or geodatabase feature classes into a single feature class.
    Combining multiple sources into a single one makes working with the data easier.
    For example, you are working on a regional transportation study and you receive
    road data from three counties. If you wish to analyze traffic flow or calculate
    the total length of roads by type for the region, it would be much easier to do
    if all the data was in a single feature class. Maybe you are responsible for maintaining
    data for a 911 center that services both the city and county. The city and county
    assign addresses for new construction and update the address point file for their
    respective jurisdiction. You would need to combine these two files for use in
    the 911 software. These are just two possible examples of situations where you
    would want to combine multiple shapefiles or geodatabase feature classes together
    into one.

    datasets into your geodatabase or exporting from your geodatabase to other formats.
    What if you only want to import a few selected features or records?
  prefs: []

- en: By default, the geoprocessing tools you have already used, such as Copy Features,
    Merge, Append, and Excel to table, will automatically be limited to selected features
    or records if you have them selected. However, most of these tools create new
    feature classes or tables. They do not just add data to an existing dataset. ArcGIS
    Pro will allow you to copy data from one layer and paste it into another existing
    layer. This allows you to choose exactly which features you want to convert or
    import.

- en: In this recipe you will copy records from a shapefile and paste them into an
    existing layer which points to a geodatabase feature class. You will do this by
    first performing a query to select the features in the shapefile you wish to import
    into the existing geodatabase layer. Then you will copy and paste those features
    from the shapefile into the geodatabase layer. The shapefile you are working with
    represents a new subdivision being constructed in the City of Trippville.
