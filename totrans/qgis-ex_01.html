Since 2007, the project has been developing under the<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> umbrella of the <strong>Open Source Geospatial Foundation</strong> (<strong>OSGeo</strong>). A relatively young project, QGIS<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> is gaining more and more popularity among individual users, private companies, and organizations all over the world due to the following<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> reasons:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Distribution under the GNU <strong>General Public License</strong> (<strong>GPL</strong>), which guarantees users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software</li><li class="listitem">Cross-platform support, which means that QGIS can run on Linux, Unix, Mac OS, Windows, and Android operating systems</li><li class="listitem">Multiple vector and raster data format support, as well as database formats and functionalities</li><li class="listitem">Permanent improvement of the core functionality, which encompasses data creation, editing, manipulation, analysis, storage, and visual representation</li><li class="listitem">Permanent growth of the external functionality available from the so-called plugins supported by the international community of developers<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>You can find more information about <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>QGIS from its official website at <a class="ulink" href="http://qgis.org/">http://qgis.org/</a> and its documentation chapter available at <a class="ulink" href="http://documentation.qgis.org/">http://documentation.qgis.org/</a>.</p></div></li></ul></div><p>According to the<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> release schedule of the QGIS project, a new version of QGIS is available every 4 months. Starting from QGIS 2.8, every third release has been a long-term release (LTR). It is maintained for a year, and then the next LTR occurs. Throughout this book, an LTR of QGIS 2.8 called "Wein" is used.</p><p>Installers for the<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> current QGIS version are available for different operating systems from the download page of the official website at <a class="ulink" href="http://download.qgis.org">http://download.qgis.org</a>.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>GUI elements and customization</h1></div></div></div><p>When you first start<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/> QGIS, you will see the interface, as shown on the following<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> screenshot. By definition, the QGIS interface uses the system language. For the purpose of this tutorial, you can change it in English by going to <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Options</strong> | <strong>Locale</strong> and restarting QGIS to apply your changes.</p><div><img src="img/image00269.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The QGIS interface consists <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>of five main sections:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem"><strong>Menu bar</strong>: This provides access to all QGIS functions in the conventional form—drop-down<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> menus.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Panels</strong>: These are<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> windows that can be either docked or floating.

For example, by dragging and dropping it onto the <strong>Layers</strong> panel, you can create two independent tabs: one for layers and the other for data source navigation. In this case, you will not have to sacrifice window the space necessary for expanding and viewing items.</p></div></li></ul></div><div><img src="img/image00270.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Panels can<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/> be turned on or off by going to <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Panels</strong>.

Some buttons or toolbars are grayed out (for example, the <strong>Digitizing</strong> toolbar and <strong>Label</strong> toolbar), which means that they can be used only after some <a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>actions have been performed. For example, the <strong>Digitizing</strong> toolbar's buttons become available only after editing mode is activated for some layers. Toolbars are dockable and can easily be moved around the workspace. To move a toolbar, place the mouse arrow over its border marked by perforation dots. The arrow will turn into a cross, symbolizing that the toolbar can now be dragged and dropped to any other place while holding down the left button of the mouse. You<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> can turn the toolbars on or off by navigating to <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Toolbars,</strong> or from the window called by a right click on any toolbar.</p></li><li class="listitem"><strong>Map area</strong>: This<a id="id27" class="indexterm"/> is the largest section of the interface window, and is designed for data map display and visual exploration.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Status bar</strong>: This briefly displays<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/> the following information about your current map overview: a progress bar of the rendering (visible only if rendering takes some time to show its progress), the mouse pointer's position coordinates, the scale, and the current coordinate reference system. It also contains toggles for switching from point position coordinates to extent, and temporarily turning off map rendering. There are also buttons used to open the coordinate reference system dialog <img src="img/image00278.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/> and show the <strong>Log Message</strong> panel <img src="img/image00279.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/>.</li></ol><div></div><p>Advanced GUI customization is possible by navigating to <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Customization</strong>. From this dialog, you can get complete control over all menus, panels, bars, and widgets. To start the process of customization, turn on the <strong>Enable customization</strong> toggle. As long as you are not familiar with QGIS interface, it will be easier to enter <img src="img/image00280.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/> <strong>Switch to catching widgets in main application</strong> mode. In this mode, you can click on any GUI item you want to hide—a button on a toolbar or a toolbar itself. The chosen items are highlighted and the relevant customization tree item is expanded, as shown in the following screenshot. If you have<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> chosen an item by mistake, simply click on it once again to unselect. Otherwise, you can expand the relevant item, check/uncheck some toggles, and click on <strong>OK</strong>. The changes are applied after QGIS restarts.</p><div><img src="img/image00281.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>As your familiarity with QGIS grows and you start using it for different tasks, it might be convenient to create a few users' GUI profiles, aimed at different use<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> cases (for example, digitizing, working with databases or raster data, and so on). To do so, you need to adjust all the necessary settings in the <strong>Customization</strong> dialog window, and save <img src="img/image00282.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/> them in a <code class="literal">.ini</code> file. After that, you will be able to quickly modify the interface just by loading settings <img src="img/image00283.jpeg" alt="GUI elements and customization"/> from a predefined customization file.</p></div><p>Some minor interface changes, such as general style, default icon size, font and more, are available from the <strong>Application</strong> group, which can be found by going to <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Options</strong> | <strong>General</strong>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Extending functionality through plugins</h1></div></div></div><p>From the very beginning, QGIS has had a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new features or functions. Most functions in QGIS are implemented in so-called plugins, which are divided into the<a id="id31" class="indexterm"/> following types:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Core plugins</strong>: These are<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> included in QGIS by default and are maintained by the development team. In order to be used, they should only be activated by a user.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>External plugins</strong>: These are<a id="id33" class="indexterm"/> located in an external repository and are maintained by the authors. In order to be used, they should first be installed by a user. With time passing, some of the most useful and popular plugins are incorporated into the QGIS core functionality.</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Managing plugins</h2></div></div></div><p>Plugin management<a id="id34" class="indexterm"/> implies their activation, installation, update, and removal, which are performed by navigating to <strong>Plugins</strong> | <strong>Manage and Install Plugins</strong>. There are several tabs in the dialog window. Clicking on an individual plugin in any of these tabs shows you detailed information: whether the plugin is experimental or not, the functionality, rating, author, version, and also some links to its <strong>homepage</strong>, <strong>code repository</strong>, and <strong>tracker</strong>:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>All</strong>: Under this tab, you can see the full list of available plugins, both installed and not installed.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Installed</strong>: This tab shows the plugins that are already installed in QGIS.

While it is not recommended<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> to use experimental plugins for production purposes, you can still activate the option to explore the entire range of available tools. By default, only <strong>QGIS Official Plugin Repository</strong> is connected, but you can connect additional repositories if you know them by clicking on the <strong>Add...</strong> button. For example, the previous screenshot shows how to add an external Boundless plugin repository.</li></ul></div><p>To install a plugin, go back to the <strong>Not installed</strong> tab, select the plugin you want to install, and click on <strong>Install plugin</strong>. After that, the installation starts, and upon its completion, the message about successful installation is displayed. The installed plugin is activated by default and either appears in the <strong>Plugins</strong> menu, or is added to another relevant menu (for example, <strong>Vector</strong> or <strong>Raster</strong>). Also, some plugins appear as separate toolbars and panels that can be placed and turned on or off manually.</p><p>Finding and choosing a plugin that fits your needs might be difficult because their number is over 400 and is constantly growing. To<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> explore the world of QGIS plugins, you can start from <a class="ulink" href="http://plugins.qgis.org/">http://plugins.qgis.org/</a>, which contains information about popular and featured plugins. If you are looking for a specific function but don't know the exact plugin name, we <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>advise you to search by using tag words in the <strong>Manage and Install Plugins</strong> dialog window, as shown on the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/image00285.jpeg" alt="Managing plugins"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>By default, plugins are sorted alphabetically by name.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Loading data into QGIS</h1></div></div></div><p>The data in the GIS can be submitted as separate files, databases, or external online sources. Moreover, there are<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> different data models used in the GIS to represent the geometry of spatial objects. The vector data model is mostly used to express discrete features, such as points (for example, separately growing trees and points of interest), lines (roads or railways), and polygons (buildings or administrative borders). Raster data is<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/> convenient for expressing continuous phenomena that are better represented by coverage than by points, lines, or polygons. The most common raster data sources are remote sensing imagery, digital elevation models, and scanned and georeferenced topographic maps.</p><p>QGIS uses the GDAL/OGR spatial data library to read and write multiple vector and raster file formats. In the following sections, we will briefly discuss the most common file formats that you can get your data in. Additionally, we will take a look at the recently widely used data sources, such as CSV files, files collected by GPS-receivers, and OpenStreetMap.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Loading shapefiles</h2></div></div></div><p>Most of our data is in the ESRI shapefile format, which is one of the most common vector data file formats. There are a few alternative ways of loading a shapefile into QGIS. You can<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> open the dialog window by going to <strong>Layer</strong> | <strong>Add Layer</strong> | <strong>Add Vector Layer</strong>, or by clicking on the relevant button <img src="img/image00286.jpeg" alt="Loading shapefiles"/> on the <strong>Manage Layers</strong> toolbar, or by using the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>V</em> keyboard shortcut.</p><p>In the <strong>Add vector layer</strong> dialog window, configure the following items:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Source type</strong>, which can be <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Directory</strong>, <strong>Database</strong>, or <strong>Protocol</strong>. By default, the <strong>File</strong> source type specified is suitable for loading spatial data represented by separate files, like in our case.</li><li class="listitem">Consider the <strong>Encoding</strong> drop-down list options if the data you work with contains special symbols or the charset of its textual attributes differs from the conventional Latin symbology. In this case, you should choose an appropriate encoding type from the drop-down list. Our data does not contain any special symbols, so we accept the default <strong>System</strong> encoding.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Browse</strong> button is meant for navigating to the work directory. There, you can choose one or several files (with the <em>Ctrl</em> key) to add after hitting the <strong>Open</strong> button.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"/>Tip</h3><p>For the first time, you are likely to be overwhelmed by the amount and diversity of the available files. This is because in the GIS, a dataset is usually represented by several files with different extensions. For example, an ESRI shapefile consists of at least 4 files (<code class="literal">.shp</code>, <code class="literal">.shx</code>, <code class="literal">.dbf</code>, and <code class="literal">.prj</code>) that share the same name, and among them, <code class="literal">.shp</code> is what you should select to load the data into QGIS. You see all the files because the file type filter in the bottom-right corner of the window is set to <strong>All files</strong> by default. To hide all unnecessary files, choose the <strong>ESRI shapefiles</strong> file type. In future, don't forget to adjust the filter according to the desired file type.</p></div></li></ul></div><p>Alternatively, you can use the <strong>Browser</strong> panel to navigate to the working directory. Select the files you want to load (either one or several, by holding down the <em>Ctrl</em> key), and then just drag and drop them onto the map area.

Depending on the receiver's capabilities, in addition to spatial coordinates, a lot of information can be registered and written—for example, time, elevation, and so on. Registered information is stored in points that represent location changes (way, track, or route points), a planned route (if it exists), and a track of movement. There are numerous formats for storing GPS data. As primary data format, QGIS uses the standard interchange <strong>GPX</strong> (<strong>GPS eXchange</strong>) format.</p><p>We will load the <code class="literal">nyc_marathon.gpx</code> file from our dataset. You can load a <code class="literal">.gpx</code> file as a vector layer by going to <strong>Layer</strong> | <strong>Add Layer</strong> | <strong>Add Vector Layer</strong>, by clicking on the relevant button <img src="img/image00286.jpeg" alt="Loading GPS data"/> in the <strong>Manage Layers</strong> toolbar, or by using the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>V</em> keyboard shortcut. Go to the data directory and apply the <strong>GPS eXchange format (GPX)</strong> file type filter. Select the file (or files) you want to add and click on <strong>Open</strong>. Alternatively, you can drag and drop files from the <strong>Browser</strong> panel.</p><div><img src="img/image00293.jpeg" alt="Loading GPS data"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As GPS data consists of points, routes, and tracks, the window pops up where you choose exactly which feature you want to open. You can select one or more features by clicking on a row and holding down the <em>Ctrl</em> key. If you are not sure exactly which feature you need, use <strong>Select All</strong>. Every feature type will be presented in a separate layer. By turning layers on and off, you can check whether they contain data or not; for example, the file we work with contains only tracks and track points. You can remove unnecessary empty<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> layers by right-clicking on the layer contextual shortcut <strong>Remove</strong>.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>Advanced options for working with GPS data are available through the <strong>GPS Tools</strong> core plugin.

Worldwide, the OSM<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> community uses high-resolution remote sensing imagery, GPS surveying, and local knowledge to make the map as accurate and detailed as possible. As the OSM data is licensed under Open Data Commons'<strong> Open Database License</strong> (<strong>ODbL</strong>), it has<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> recently become a widely used source of spatial data. Understanding the importance of unrestricted access to spatial data, QGIS supports OSM, providing integrated access and support for its data.</p><p>The QGIS core functionality is available from the <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> menu under<strong> Vector</strong>. Here, you can find all the required tools to download the data and export it into conventional spatial data formats, but if you are new to the QGIS and OSM data concepts, you may find the process tedious. This is why we recommend that you use external <strong>QuickOSM</strong> plugin capabilities to download the OSM data.</p><p>After installation as <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>described in the <em>Extending functionality through plugins</em> section, the plugin's main functionality can be accessed by going to <strong>Web</strong> | <strong>QuickOSM</strong> | <strong>QuickOSM</strong>. The <strong>Quick query</strong> tab of the main window contains everything you need to perform a query and get the data into QGIS. First, define a <code class="literal">key=value</code> pair from the drop-down lists, or just type it in manually.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>It can be quite difficult to select the appropriate tags for the first time if you are not familiar with the OSM tagging system. Each tag is a <code class="literal">key=value</code> pair that describes some point, linear, or polygonal feature. The key describes a broad class (for example, amenities), while the value gives the details (bank, cinema, café, bicycle parking, and so on). Use the <strong>Help with key/value</strong> button to know more about tagging from the<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> OSM wiki page at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapfeatures">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapfeatures</a>.</p></div><p>Then, set up the area of interest extent by location name, map canvas, or layer.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Dealing with projections</h1></div></div></div><p>Projections define how real-world objects on the curved surface of the earth will be flattened and projected on a map-like planar surface. Different data sources are usually created and distributed<a id="id64" class="indexterm"/> in different projections, depending on acquisition techniques and the scope of application. To be able to manipulate and analyze them properly in QGIS, it is important to understand how it interprets and manages information about projections.</p><p>QGIS supports about 2,700<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> CRS. They constitute a database, each item of which is described by an <strong>ESPG identifier</strong>, and a description line in the format of the <strong>PROJ.4</strong> projection library. To store and read information about projection, QGIS uses its own format stored in <code class="literal">.qpj</code> files. There are two important points to keep in mind while working with projections: a data source projection and project projection—which are not always the same.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>Data source projection</h2></div></div></div><p>When you load your<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> data into QGIS, it tries to automatically define information about the projection from the accompanying projection description file and <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>set it to a newly added layer. You can check the layer's projection information in the <strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog. To open it, double-click on the layer name in <strong>Layers</strong> panel, or use the right-click contextual shortcut <strong>Properties</strong>. Information about the projection is shown in the <strong>Coordinate reference system</strong> section of the <strong>General</strong> tab, like this:</p><div><img src="img/image00297.jpeg" alt="Data source projection"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>There are numerous projection description file formats, and they mostly depend on the data format and origin. One of the most common among them is a <code class="literal">.prj</code> file. This file format sometimes provides information about the projection in a reduced form, and QGIS cannot define it properly. If information about the projection is absent or incomplete, you will see that the<a id="id68" class="indexterm"/> projection description is missing or looks like this: <code class="literal">USER:100000 - * Generated CRS (+proj=etc.)</code>. It means that QGIS <a id="id69" class="indexterm"/>didn't find an appropriate projection within its own database and added it as a custom CRS. If you are sure that the projection is standard but QGIS fails to interpret it properly because of a reduced description, specify it manually. There are different ways to assess the <strong>Coordinate Reference System Selector</strong> dialog as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
Double-click on the layer name in <strong>Layers</strong> panel to open the <strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog. Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, click on the <strong>Select CRS</strong> button <img src="img/image00298.jpeg" alt="Data source projection"/> to select the necessary CRS from the <strong>Coordinate reference system selector</strong> dialog window.
</li><li class="listitem">By going to <strong>Layer</strong> | <strong>Set CRS of Layer(s)</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Using the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>C</em> keyboard shortcut.</li><li class="listitem">By right-clicking on the layer shortcut <strong>Set Layer CRS</strong>.</li></ul></div><p>In the <strong>Coordinate reference system selector</strong> dialog, choose the necessary CRS from the list and click on <strong>OK</strong>. Note that you can use a filter by key words or the EPSG code to hide unnecessary projections. With time, often used projections will be added to the list of the recently used CRS.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>If QGIS doesn't define a projection for your data automatically and you are not sure about projection name and EPSG code, use the<a id="id70" class="indexterm"/> Prj2EPSG website at <a class="ulink" href="http://prj2epsg.org/">http://prj2epsg.org/</a>. In this service, you just need to upload your <code class="literal">.prj</code> file, and well-known text projection information from it will be converted into standard EPSG code.</p></div><p>Note that specifying the projection manually from the <strong>Properties</strong> dialog is a temporary solution; it does not persist after closing a file and/or exiting QGIS. This means that whenever you are loading this file into QGIS, you will have to specify the projection again. If you are going to work with the file in other projects, it is better to use the <strong>Define Current Projection</strong> tool by going to<strong> Vector</strong> | <strong>Data Management Tools</strong> | <strong>Define Current Projection</strong>. In this dialog, you can choose a predefined spatial reference system from the <strong>Coordinate reference system Selector</strong> dialog or <strong>Import spatial reference system from existing layer</strong> with a known CRS. In both the cases, the existing <code class="literal">.prj</code> file will be overwritten by QGIS with all the necessary parameters, and you will not have to adjust the projection<a id="id71" class="indexterm"/> manually next time.</p><div><img src="img/image00299.jpeg" alt="Data source projection"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>All of this is<a id="id72" class="indexterm"/> true when you import files from external sources. If you create a shapefile in QGIS, both <code class="literal">.prj</code> and <code class="literal">.qpj</code> files are created, so you don't need to define the projection manually. The files projection will be interpreted correctly in the other GIS applications that read it from <code class="literal">.prj</code> files.</p><p>You can also maintain QGIS behavior when loading or creating a new layer that has no CRS information by going to <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Options</strong> | <strong>CRS</strong>, where three alternatives of CRS for new layers are available:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem"><strong>Prompt for CRS</strong>: In this case, you will always be asked to manually specify the CRS for the layer.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Use project CRS</strong>: The data will be automatically assigned a CRS set for a project. This is a convenient choice if you are using files in the same projection, but if their projection differs from what is specified, you will not be able to see them.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Use default CRS displayed below</strong>: Conventionally, <strong>EPSG:4326 - WGS 84</strong> is used, but you can specify your own choice.</li></ol><div></div><p>Working with <a id="id73" class="indexterm"/>projections can be tricky, unless you recognize the difference between the <strong>specify</strong> and <strong>define projection</strong> options. It's all about assigning information about the projection properly, but when you specify it, the result is<a id="id74" class="indexterm"/> temporary within a current working session. Once you define a projection, it becomes permanent unless redefined again. In both cases, if you choose the wrong projection, you will not be able to see your data on the map (at least in the area where you expect it to be). Usually it is good practice to specify the projection at first, comparing your data to the correctly projected dataset. If everything is okay, define it to make projection assignment permanent.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>Project projection</h2></div></div></div><p>When you load QGIS, its map<a id="id75" class="indexterm"/> canvas projection is, by default, set to <strong>EPSG:4326 – WGS 84</strong>. This behavior is defined by the global default projection, which can be changed by going to <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Options</strong> | <strong>CRS</strong> | <strong>Always start new projects with this CRS</strong>.</p><p>However, when you<a id="id76" class="indexterm"/> start adding data, projection identifier automatically changes to the projection of the first loaded layer. So, by default, project projection is defined by the first loaded layer. Data source projection and project projection are not always the same. If they are different, QGIS can apply the so-called <strong>on-the-fly transformation</strong>. This means that it reads the data projection, and if it differs, automatically aligns it with the project projection, applying the necessary transformations. There are a few ways to specify the projection for the project and enable on-the-fly transformation:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">By going to <strong>Project</strong> | <strong>Project Properties</strong> | <strong>CRS</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">
Click on the <strong>Current CRS</strong><img src="img/image00278.jpeg" alt="Project projection"/> button on the <strong>Status</strong> bar, and activating <strong>Enable 'on the fly' CRS transformation</strong> in the <strong>Project properties</strong> | <strong>CRS</strong> window.</li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Options</strong> | <strong>CRS</strong> | <strong>Default CRS for new projects</strong>. Activate either <strong>Automatically enable 'on the fly' reprojection if layers have different CRS</strong> or <strong>Enable 'on the fly' reprojection by default</strong>.</li></ul></div><p>In the last way, the difference is very subtle and is mainly obvious when adding the first layer to the project. In the case of automatically enabled reprojection, the default map canvas CRS will be superseded by the first layer projection, and the following layers will be automatically adjusted to it too. In the case of reprojection by default, all layers will be reprojected<a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> into the project initial CRS (this is usually default global projection, unless you've changed it).</p><p>After on-the-fly transformation is enabled, you will see an <strong>OTF</strong> abbreviation near the current CRS on<a id="id78" class="indexterm"/> the status bar, and the icon will become solid.</p><p>If you want to quickly change the project CRS according to a specific layer in the <strong>Layers</strong> panel, right-click on a layer and choose the <strong>Set Project CRS from Layer</strong> shortcut.</p></div></div>
