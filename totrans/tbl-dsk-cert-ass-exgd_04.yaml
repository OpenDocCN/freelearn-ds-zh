- en: Calculated fields are treated like any other field. They are categorized as
    a dimension or a measure based on whether the result of the calculated field is
    quantitative or qualitative. The ability to create fields to use for your analysis
    is powerful and one that you will use repeatedly. There are many uses for calculated
    fields. They are easy to use and will help to solve many questions when you begin
    analyzing your data. We will learn more about calculated fields in later chapters
    (see [Chapter 5](8517c27d-d41d-41de-b8d4-ac5e779ea22f.xhtml), *Understanding Simple
    Calculations in Tableau*, and [Chapter 6](1f655860-ac26-457f-a78b-f359ccb7d9f0.xhtml),
