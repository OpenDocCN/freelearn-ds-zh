                    Preface
                
            
            
                
<p>Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to read this book. Throughout this book, I will take you on a journey through the <strong>evolution of data analysis</strong> in a very simple and easy-to-understand manner. The book will introduce you to modern tools, such as <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> and various <strong>Python</strong> libraries, to teach you how to work with data. In the process, you will learn about the many different types of data and how to clean, blend, visualize, and analyze data to gain useful insights.</p>
<p><strong>Data literacy</strong> is the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data. Data analysis is the process of cleaning and modeling your data to discover useful information. This book combines both concepts by sharing proven techniques and hands-on examples, so you can learn how to communicate effectively with data.</p>
<p>Complete with hands-on tutorials and real-world examples, this easy-to-follow guide will teach you concepts of data analysis using SQL, Python, and Jupyter Notebook.</p>
