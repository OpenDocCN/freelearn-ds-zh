    (**NLP**) with Python and spaCy. You will learn how the book is organized and
    how to make the best use of the book. You will then start by installing spaCy
    and its statistical models and take a quick dive into the spaCy world. Basic operations,
    general conventions, and visualization are the core attractions of this section.
