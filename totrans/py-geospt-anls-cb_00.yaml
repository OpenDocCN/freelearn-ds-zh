- en: Geospatial analysis is not special; it is just different when compared to other
    types of analysis such as financial market analysis. We work with geometry objects,
    such as lines, points, and polygons, and connect these geometries to attributes
    such as business data. We ask "where" question, such as "Where is the nearest
    pub?", "Where are all my customers located?", and "Where is my competition located?".
    The other location questions include, "Will this new building cast a shadow over
    the park?", "What is the shortest way to school?", "What is the safest way to
    school for my kids?", "Will this building block my view of the mountains?", and
    "Where is the optimal place to build my next store?". Identify the areas that
    fire trucks can reach from their station in 5 min, 10 min, or 20 min, and so on.

- en: One thing all these questions have in common is the fact that you need to know
    where certain objects are located in order to answer them. Without the *spatial*
    component, you cannot answer such questions and this is what geospatial analysis
    is all about.

    identified. This ability to see a pattern or trend is geospatial analysis in its
    simplest form.

    trends, and seeing patterns that are not visible in a spreadsheet.

    for beginners. It also has advanced powers for professionals to help them quickly
    code solutions to complex problems. Python makes visualization quick and easy
    for experts or beginners who work with geospatial data. It's that simple.

    *Setting Up Your Geospatial Python Environment*, explores setting up your computer
    to handle all software requirements in one go, such as pyproj, NumPy, and Shapely.
    All your development software needs to enable spatial analysis or geoprocessing
    on Windows and Linux are met in this chapter.'

    Projections*, explains how to deal with spatial data that''s projected or unprojected.
    You can learn and discover how to transform your data into a correct projection
    to prepare for an analysis.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Moving Spatial Data from One Format to Another"),
    *Moving Spatial Data from One Format to Another*, explains how geospatial data
    comes in many different formats and also how messaging data from one format to
    another is a daily chore. In this chapter, you will find out about the most common
    data management tasks.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Working with PostGIS"), *Working with PostGIS*,
    shows you how most of our geospatial data is stored in a spatial database and
    using, accessing, manipulating this data with Python is what this chapter is about.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Vector Analysis"), *Vector Analysis*, introduces
    a very common geospatial data format, that is, the vector data format. To execute
    analysis functions on vector data, we will explore patterns used to create new
    data by snapping, clipping, cutting, and overlaying vector datasets followed by
    determining the 3D ground distance and total elevation gain.'

    with GeoDjango*, builds on [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Network Routing Analysis"),
    *Network Routing Analysis*, where you will create an indoor routing web application.
    You will easily be able to route a person from point A to point B within a building
    with real 3D network data. These key features will be presented by bringing together
    all the parts of the recipes you have learned so far.'

- en: To work with this book, you should be familiar with the programming language
    Python and the concepts involved in programming. This means that you should be
    able to install Python 2.7.x on your machine (Windows, Linux, or OS X) if it's
    not already installed. The concepts related to GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
    are definitely helpful but not necessary. A primer to this book could be *Learning
    Geospatial Analysis with Python, Joel Lawhead* or *Python Geospatial Development*,
    *Eric Westra*, both by *Packt Publishing*.

    analyst, researcher, or scientist looking to learn about spatial analysis, then
    this book is for you. Anyone trying to answer simple to complex spatial analysis
    questions will get a working demonstration of the power of Python with the help
    of real-world data. Some of you may be beginners but most of you will probably
    have a basic understanding of geospatial analysis and programming.
