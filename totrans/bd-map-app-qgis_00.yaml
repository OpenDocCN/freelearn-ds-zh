- en: As software applications become more and more a part of people's lives, the
    concepts of location and space become more important. Developers are regularly
    finding themselves having to work with location-based data. Maps, geospatial data,
    and spatial calculations are increasingly becoming just another part of the everyday
    programming repertoire.

- en: A decade ago, geospatial concepts and development was limited to experts in
    the Geographic Information Sciences. These people spent years working with maps
    and the complex mathematics that underlie them. Often coming from a university
    background, these specialists would spend years becoming familiar with a particular
    Geographic Information System (GIS), and would make a career of using that system
    to draw maps and process geospatial data.

- en: While the ever-popular Google Maps meant that anyone can view and manipulate
    a map, the more advanced custom display and processing of geospatial data was
    still limited to those who used a professional GIS system. All this changed with
    the advent of freely available (and often open source) tools for manipulating
    and displaying geospatial data. Now, anybody can learn the necessary concepts
    and start building their own mapping applications from scratch. Rather than being
    limited to the minimal capabilities and restrictive licensing terms of Google
    Maps, developers can now build their own mapping systems to meet their own requirements,
    and there are no limits to what can be done.

- en: While the necessary tools and libraries are freely available, the developer
    still needs to put them together into a workable system. Often, this is a rather
    complex process and requires a lot of understanding of geospatial concepts, as
    well as how to compile the necessary wrappers and configure the tools to work
    on a particular computer.

- en: Fortunately, now there is an even easier way to include geospatial programming
    tools and techniques within your Python applications. Thanks to the development
    of the freely available QGIS system, it is now easy to install a complete geospatial
    development environment, which you can use directly from within your Python code.
    Whether you choose to build your application as a plugin for the QGIS system,
    or write a standalone mapping application using QGIS as an external library, you
    have complete flexibility in how you use geospatial capabilities within your code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](part0014_split_000.html#page "Chapter 1. Getting Started with QGIS"),
    *Getting Started with QGIS*, shows you how to install and run the QGIS application,
    and introduces the three main ways in which Python can be used with QGIS.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](part0017_split_000.html#page "Chapter 2. The QGIS Python Console"),
    *The QGIS Python Console*, explores the QGIS Python Console window, and explains
    how it acts as a useful tool while building your own custom mapping applications.
    It also gives you a taste of what can be done with Python and QGIS, and improves
    your confidence and familiarity with the QGIS environment.'

    for the QGIS Python developer, and shows how these libraries can be used to work
    with geospatial data and create useful and interesting maps based on your geospatial
    data.'

    *Creating QGIS Plugins*, introduces the concept of a QGIS plugin, and explains
    how to write a plugin using Python. We take an in-depth look at how plugins work,
    and how to create a useful geospatial application as a QGIS plugin. We also look
    at the possibilities and limitations of QGIS plugins.'

    Application"), *Using QGIS in an External Application*, completes the process
    of building standalone Python applications that make use of the QGIS Python libraries.
    You will learn how to create a wrapper script to handle platform-specific dependencies,
    design and build a simple but complete standalone mapping application, and learn
    about the structure of an application built on top of QGIS. Along the way, you
    will become a far more competent QGIS programmer as you build your own turnkey
    mapping application from scratch.'
