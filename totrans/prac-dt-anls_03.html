<p>Now that you have a better understanding of concepts behind data literacy and the evolution of data analysis, let's set up our own environment to allow you to work with data. In this chapter, we are going to provide an introduction to the Python programming language along with a popular tool called Jupyter Notebook that's used <span>to run commands for data analysis.</span> We will walk through the installation process step by step and discuss key concepts to understand why they are required for data analysis. By the end of this chapter, you will have a workstation available to run a <kbd>hello world</kbd> program that will help in building your confidence to move forward into deeper concepts.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Python and using Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Storing and retrieving data files</li>
<li>Hello World! – running your first Python code</li>
<li>Exploring Python packages</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="uuid-cde7f7f8-8e1f-4736-93f4-bea501bfe054">Installing Python and using Jupyter Notebook</h1>
<p>I'm going to start by admitting this chapter may become obsolete in the future because installing open source software on your workstation can be a painful process and, in some cases, is being replaced by preinstalled virtual machines or cloud versions. For example, Microsoft offers a free Azure subscription option for a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>Understanding all of the dependencies of software versions, hardware, <span><strong>Operating System</strong> </span>(<strong>OS</strong>) differences, and library dependencies can be complex. Further, your IT department rules on software installations in enterprise environments may have security restrictions that prohibit access to your workstation filesystem. In all likelihood, with more innovation in cloud computing, most of the steps will already be done ahead of time, eliminating the need to install software altogether.</p>
<p>With that said, I'm going to walk you through the process of installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, pointing out tips and pitfalls to educate you on key concepts along the way. I would compare u<span>sing these technology tools to work with data </span>to driving a car. The ability to drive should not be dependent on your ability to repair the car engine! Just knowing that you need an engine should be sufficient to drive and move forward. So, my focus is on setting up your workstation for data analysis quickly without focusing on the layers of details behind these powerful technologies.</p>
<p>The open source project that created the Jupyter Notebook app evolved from iPython back in 2014. Many of the features that existed in iPython still exist today in Jupyter, for example, the interactive GUI to run Python commands and parallel processing. There is a kernel to control the input/output between your computer's CPU, memory, and filesystem. Finally, there's also the feature of a notebook that collects all of the commands, code, charts, and comments in a single shareable file with the <kbd>.ipynb</kbd><span> </span><span>extension</span><span>.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Just to give some context of how popular Jupyter notebooks have become for data analysis, I discovered a public GitHub repository by <span>Peter Parente </span>that collects a daily count of the number of public <kbd>.pynb</kbd> files found in GitHub since 2014. The growth is exponential, as the number grew from just over 65,000 to 5.7 million by November 2019, which means it has been doubling every year for the last five years!</div>
<p>The first prerequisite to using a Jupyter notebook is installing Python. We are going to use Python version 3.3 or greater and there are two methods you can use to install the software: a direct download or a package manager. A direct download will have more control over the installation on your workstation but then it requires additional time to manage dependent libraries. That said, using a package manager to install Python has become preferred method, hence, I cover this method in this chapter. </p>
<div class="packt_tip">Python is a powerful coding language with support on multiple OS platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. I encourage you to read more about the history of this powerful software language and the creator, Guido van Rossum.</div>
<p>Python, at its core, is a command-line programming language, so you must be comfortable with running some commands from a prompt. When we have finished installation, you will have a Python command-line window, which will look like the following screenshot if your workstation has Windows OS:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fa36b410-bffb-450e-a3bd-5644cafed652.png" style="width:72.42em;height:7.58em;"/></div>
<p>Think of the Python installation as a means to an end because what we really want to use as data analysts is a Jupyter notebook, which is also known as an <span><strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> </span>(<strong>IDE</strong>) used to run code and call libraries in a self-contained <strong>Graphical User Interface</strong> (<strong>GUI</strong>).</p>
<p>Since I recommend using a package manager for installation, the first decision you must make is which package manager to use for the installation on your computer. A package manager is designed to streamline the versions and layers of dependencies between the open source libraries, your OS, and software. The most common ones are <kbd>conda</kbd>, <kbd>pip</kbd>, or <kbd>docker</kbd>.</p>
<p>From researching the differences, I prefer <kbd>conda</kbd> over <kbd>pip</kbd> for someone just getting started, especially if you are unfamiliar with running command-line commands and managing software installs directly on your PC. For an app-store-like experience, where all you have to do is download, install with a few prompts, and then launch the software, I would recommend Anaconda especially since it includes Python, several popular libraries required for data analysis, and Jupyter all as part of the download package.</p>

<div class="packt_tip">Remember, the goal is to get Jupyter Notebook up and running on your workstation, so feel free to choose installation alternatives, especially if you prefer a <strong>Command-Line Interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>).</div>
<h2 id="uuid-3fcceff6-bb98-40a2-b753-969d34d22732">Installing Anaconda</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to install Anaconda. <span>For this walkthrough, I have selected a Windows OS installer but the screenshots of installation will be similar regardless of which one is selected:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Download the software by choosing which installer is required based on your workstation's OS. To do this, navigate to the <span class="packt_screen">Anaconda Distribution</span> page, which should look similar to the following screenshot and is found on <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">https://www.anaconda.com/</a>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/10ad98c5-b081-4d46-abb2-fedd0f5009cc.png" style="width:67.08em;height:33.67em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You should see the <span class="packt_screen">Setup</span> wizard as shown in<em> </em>the following screenshot after you download the software and launch the installer on your PC:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f03f00bf-ce2c-4981-a1b0-e88013a970b3.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select the default options in the install wizard and you should see a message similar to the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/17b9dc57-440a-480f-a62b-1056333b715b.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now that Anaconda has completed the installation, you must launch the <span class="packt_screen">Anaconda Navigator</span> application from your PC, which is shown in the following screenshot using a Windows OS. Since there are multiple OS options available such as Windows, macOS, or Ubuntu, your screen will vary from the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9695d77c-a300-48bb-aa80-3c755ea6a732.png" style="width:54.67em;height:31.17em;"/></div>
<p>I think of the installation process as similar to why an artist would need to buy a canvas, easel, and supplies to begin painting. Now that we have a working Python environment installed and available to use called Anaconda, you are ready to launch Jupyter and create your first notebook.</p>
<h2 id="uuid-b3b86184-e850-441b-8751-ba5906d06a23">Running Jupyter and installing Python packages for data analysis</h2>
<p>Once the software is installed on your PC, launching your Jupyter notebook can be done in either of two ways. The first is via a command-line prompt with the <kbd>jupyter notebook</kbd> <span>command</span><span> </span><span>from</span> <span class="packt_screen">Anaconda Prompt</span><span>, which will look similar to the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5c46c68a-fbd6-4901-967b-dcd8890b91c6.png" style="width:76.00em;height:11.67em;"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You can also use the <span class="packt_screen">Anaconda Navigator</span> software and click the <span class="packt_screen">Launch</span> button from <span class="packt_screen">My Applications</span> in <span>Jupyter Notebook, </span>which is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b5a6c3de-96f5-4ec5-b010-f71702061099.png" style="width:54.33em;height:31.75em;"/></p>
<p>Either option will launch a new web browser session with the <kbd>http://localhost:8888/tree</kbd> <span>URL,</span><span> </span><span>which is known as the Jupyter dashboard. If you do not see something similar to the following screenshot</span><strong>,</strong> <span>you may need to reinstall the Anaconda software or check whether firewall ports are blocking commands or dependencies. In an enterprise setting, you may have to review your corporate policies or request IT support:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8d3cb440-3ca7-4e07-a425-726613ec9423.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">If you would like to try JupyterLab instead of Jupyter Notebook, either solution will work. JupyterLab uses the exact same Notebook server and file format as the classic Jupyter Notebook so that it is fully compatible with the existing notebooks and kernels. The classic Notebook and JupyterLab can run side to side on the same computer. You can easily switch between the two interfaces.</div>
<p>Notice that Jupyter defaults with access to your workstation's filesystem based on how it was installed. This should be sufficient in most cases but if you would like to change the default project <kbd>home</kbd>/<kbd>root</kbd> folder, you can easily change it using Anaconda Prompt.<strong> </strong>Just run the <kbd>cd</kbd> command to change directory before you type the <kbd>jupyter notebook</kbd> command.</p>
<p>For example, I created a <kbd>project</kbd> folder on my local <kbd>c:\</kbd> drive path on my Windows PC first and then ran the Anaconda Prompt window with the following commands:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;cd \</strong><br/><strong><span>&gt;cd projects<br/></span>&gt;jupyter notebook</strong></pre>
<p>If you walk through this example, your Command Prompt window should look like the following screenshot if you're using Windows OS:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6b16a838-8be3-4f93-a346-96012c3003da.png" style="width:71.42em;height:17.75em;"/></p>
<p>Once complete, the list of files and folders displayed in the Jupyter session will be blank and your session will look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/614d30e9-6514-40ce-85e7-8998e9f2aa45.png"/></div>
<p>You should now have the Jupyter software actively running on your workstation, ready to walk through all of the features available, which we will cover next.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-0e3768b7-3952-47b2-9dd1-7d95d730535a"><span>Storing and retrieving data files</span></h1>
<p>What I like about using Jupyter is that it is a self-contained solution for data analysis. What I mean by that statement is you can interact with the filesystem to add, update, and delete folders and files plus run Python commands all in one place. As you continue using this tool, I think you will find it much easier to navigate by staying in one ecosystem compared to hopping between multiple windows, apps, or systems on your workstation.</p>
<p>Let's begin with getting comfortable navigating the menu options to add, edit, or delete files. Jupyter defaults the dashboard by listing all files and folders that are accessible on your workstation from the directory paths it was installed. This is can be configured to change the starting folder but we will use the Windows default. In the following screenshot, I have highlighted the important sections of the Jupyter dashboard with letters for easy reference:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4a735e04-42f9-4dff-829b-9bfb213c3ad8.png" style="width:49.83em;height:27.17em;"/></p>
<p>In the<span> </span><strong><span>A</span></strong><span> section</span><span>, the URL defaults to</span> <kbd>http://localhost:888/tree</kbd> <span>when running on your personal workstation. This URL will change if the notebook is hosted on a server or cloud. Notice, as you make selections to folders or files in the</span><span> </span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span> section</span><span>, the URL address will change to follow the location and path of your selections.</span></p>
<p>In the<span> </span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span> section</span><span>, you will find a hierarchy of accessible folders or files that are visible to the dashboard. If you click on any file, it will attempt to open it in the editor, whether or not the file is usable by Jupyter. Readable file extensions by the editor include images in formats such as </span><kbd>.jpeg</kbd><span>,</span> <kbd>.png</kbd><span>, and </span><kbd>.svg</kbd><span>; semi-structured data files such as </span><kbd>.json</kbd><span>,</span> <kbd>.csv</kbd><span>, and </span><kbd>.xml</kbd><span>; and code such as </span><kbd>.html</kbd><span>,</span> <kbd>.py</kbd> <span>(Python), and</span> <kbd>.js</kbd> <span>(JavaScript). Note that the URL path will change from the</span> <kbd>tree</kbd><span> </span><span>parameter word</span><span> </span><span>to</span> <kbd>edit</kbd><span> </span><span>as it opens the file.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">If the editor does not recognize a file, it will provide an error in the first line and tell you why, similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4eca4ee4-8e01-4f62-9e8d-4ecc13d9aaed.png"/></p>
<p>In the <strong>C</strong> section, you can select and filter one or more files or folders displayed on the dashboard. This can be used to organize your project workspace when creating multiple notebooks and organizing data files for analysis. Once any file or folder is selected, the title Select items to perform actions on them will change to the action buttons <strong>Rename</strong> and <strong>Duplicate</strong> and a red trashcan icon, which deletes the files or folder, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1ac2ee11-4b4e-486d-8afe-8081180cfd7b.png" style="width:15.92em;height:5.42em;"/></p>
<p>In the dashboard, you will also notice the tabs labeled <span class="packt_screen">Files</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Running</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Clusters</span>. These are used by the Jupyter app to keep you oriented and track processes that are actively running. <span class="packt_screen">Clusters</span> is an advanced feature and beyond the scope of this book. We have already covered the <span class="packt_screen">Files</span> tab from section <strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's discuss the <span class="packt_screen">Running</span> tab. It has two sections: <span class="packt_screen">Terminals</span>, which would be system shell commands such as Powershell in the Windows OS, and <span class="packt_screen">Notebooks</span>, which will show you all active notebooks that are in use. Once we create a few notebooks, I encourage you to refresh the browser to see which notebook files are active to better understand this feature. Use the <span class="packt_screen">Shutdown</span> button if it becomes necessary to kill an active notebook that is unresponsive or taking up too much of your computer resources (CPU/RAM).</p>
<p>In the<span> </span><strong><span>D</span></strong><span> section</span><span>, you will see an</span> <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span><span> button that allows you to add files to the dashboard in any folder you have navigated. The</span> <span class="packt_screen">New</span><span> button includes a submenu to create a</span> <span class="packt_screen">Text File</span><span>,</span> <span class="packt_screen">Folder</span><span>, or</span> <span class="packt_screen">Python 3</span><span class="packt_screen"> Notebook</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<h1 id="uuid-3ccc7ca1-534d-4b5f-bf11-cf10e46f63f3">Hello World! – running your first Python code</h1>
<p>Now that we have a better understanding of the dashboard and its navigation, let's create our first notebook and run some Python code. The easiest method is to click on the <span class="packt_screen">New</span> button and select <span class="packt_screen">Python 3</span> in the submenu. This will open a new tab or window in your browser that looks similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/24497712-89c5-4d68-bbe5-f734efb41129.png" style="width:42.83em;height:12.58em;"/></p>
<p>I recommend renaming the <span class="packt_screen">Untitled</span> files of any notebook to make it easier to find them later. To do this, select <span class="packt_screen">Rename</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">File</span> menu, as shown in the following screenshot, and rename it <kbd>hello_world</kbd> or a relevant project name. Once you click on the <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> button, the <span>title bar at the top of the page</span> will display the new name:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b6637b32-60cb-4a5a-8178-376e9c37e9f8.png" style="width:36.00em;height:20.33em;"/></p>
<p>By renaming the notebook, a new file with the <kbd>.ipynb</kbd> extension will be created, which contains all of the contents in JSON format. This helps make the notebook file shareable to others and helps with version control, which is an audit trail of changes made in the file.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You can view the actual JSON metadata contents by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Edit Notebook Metadata</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> menu. The results will look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8ed1d340-88bd-40da-8de1-1be467390a5b.png" style="width:41.92em;height:33.42em;"/></p>
<p>The UI for the notebook looks very similar to other modern web software used today as it was designed for easy navigation. The following menu options are easy to use icons that are collectively called the <span class="packt_screen">Notebook Toolbar</span>, which supports keyboard shortcuts for optimal workflow as you get more comfortable using the tool. You can find the <span class="packt_screen">User Interface Tour</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Keyboard Shortcuts</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> menu, as shown in the following screenshot. I recommend going through them to take a look at all of the features available:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dd688ac9-0ccf-4829-a7f2-0f25a158fed2.png" style="width:49.58em;height:30.67em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">Once you feel comfortable with the <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> menu options, let's write your first code by typing in the <kbd>print("hello world")</kbd> <span>command</span><span> </span><span>in the notebook cell, which has a default of</span> <kbd>In []:</kbd><span>. Remember, if you are using a mouse to navigate the notebook, you must click on the cell to select it and have a cursor appear.</span></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_tip"><br/>
Pressing the <em>Enter</em> key after a command will only create a second line for more input. You must either use a keyboard shortcut, the <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span> menu, or a Toolbar icon to execute any command.</div>
<p>Once you have entered the <kbd>print("hello world")</kbd> <span>command</span><span> </span><span>in the cell and clicked on any one of the following options. The options to run the command in any cell are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <sub><img src="assets/2624475e-01cc-4beb-9fc0-6c57639db0f6.png" style="width:1.50em;height:1.33em;"/></sub> button from the toolbar.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Run Cells</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span> menu.</li>
<li>Press the <em>Shift </em>+ <em>Enter</em> or <em>Ctrl </em>+ <em>Enter</em> keys.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span>The screen should look </span>similar<span> to the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/84fcd699-effb-48a3-893e-6c03deaf6f14.png"/></div>
<p>Congratulations, you have created your first Jupyter notebook and run your first command! Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Close and Halt</span> option from the <span class="packt_screen">File</span> menu to return to the dashboard.</p>
<h2 id="uuid-285245f9-5b78-41d3-9a01-3172bf582bf5">Creating a project folder hierarchy</h2>
<p class="mce-root">Now that we have covered the basics, let's walk through a directory to find a particular file and create a project folder hierarchy to prepare for future data analysis learning modules. I recommend creating a starting <kbd>projects</kbd> folder on your workstation to keep all of your notebooks and data organized. A standard enterprise directory structure will vary by company but setting up a basic structure with subfolders makes the process portable and helps with sharing work with others. An example project folder template is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/459e5358-387b-49b4-963c-bf108290fff2.png" style="width:67.42em;height:17.92em;"/></div>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox">Throughout this book, I will use chapter numbers as <kbd>projectname</kbd> to make each directory subfolder, such as <kbd>data</kbd> and <kbd>notebooks</kbd>, modular, independent, and easy to follow. Your workstation directory structure and tree should match with this book's GitHub repository to make it easier to synchronize your files and folders. </div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In the classic <em>do as I say, not as I do</em> fashion and because of limitations with relative paths across different OS versions, the examples use the same folder to prevent errors <span>throughout this book</span>. To proceed, you can either clone or download all of the files and subfolders from this book's GitHub repository, create all of the folders and files in the Jupyter dashboard, or create them on your workstation. Once completed, your project folder for this chapter should look like the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c916a856-888e-4cc4-bdf4-4342f3543fca.png" style="width:62.67em;height:30.17em;"/></p>
<h2 id="uuid-9a28163b-2d02-4f7d-ad1d-fb859f6ff1a0">Uploading a file</h2>
<p>Now that we have a project folder, let's walk through the following steps to upload a file for analysis. You must download the file ahead of time from the GitHub repository URL found in the <em>Technical requirements</em> section:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <kbd>data</kbd> folder name.</li>
<li>Click on the <kbd>source</kbd> subfolder name.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span> button at the top-right side of the screen.</li>
<li>Select <kbd>evolution_of_data_analysis.csv</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click the blue <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span> button to proceed. Once done, you'll see a file in the dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b472628b-fd01-469d-a9e8-ba5bee2e5c54.png" style="width:50.83em;height:18.67em;"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Navigate back to the <kbd>notebooks</kbd> folder and create a new notebook file by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">New</span> menu. Similar to the <kbd>hello_world</kbd> example, select <span class="packt_screen">Python 3</span> in the submenu to create a default <kbd>Untitled</kbd> notebook.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As mentioned earlier, I always rename the <kbd>Untitled</kbd> notebook before moving forward, so rename the notebook <kbd>evolution_of_data_analysis</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>To read data from a file in the notebook, you must run a few Python commands. These can be run all in one cell or as three separate cell entries. The commands to open the CSV file we uploaded earlier are as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">f = open("../data/source/evolution_of_data_analysis.csv","r")<br/>print(f.read())<br/>f.close()</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Let's walk through the commands line by line. First, we assigned an open command value of the file to the <kbd>f</kbd> <span>variable </span>to shorten the length of additional commands in the next few lines. Notice the <kbd>evolution_of_data_analysis.csv</kbd> file includes the directory path of <kbd>"../data/source/"</kbd>, which is required because the location of the active notebook, <kbd>evolution_of_data_analysis</kbd>, is in a different folder. The open command also includes a parameter of <kbd>r</kbd>, which means we only want to read the file and not edit the content.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The second line is to print the contents of the file by passing the <kbd>f</kbd> <span>variable </span>along with the <kbd>read()</kbd> function. This will display the results in the output cell, which will be similar to the following screenshot:</p>

<p>The last line is a best practice to close the file to avoid any conflicts using the file later or in the filesystem of your OS. Once you verify that you can see the contents of the CSV file in your notebook, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Close and Halt</span> option from the <span class="packt_screen">File</span> menu to return to the dashboard.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-be417ff6-1057-4a3a-b358-803931f7be4f">Exploring Python packages</h1>
<p>Before wrapping up this chapter, let's explore the different Python packages required with data analysis and validate they are available to use in the Jupyter Notebook app. These packages have evolved over time and are open source so programmers can contribute and improve the source code.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">The version of the Python packages will increment over time depending on when you install <kbd>conda</kbd> or <kbd>pip</kbd> (package manager) on your machine. If you receive errors running commands, validate they match the versions used in this book.</div>
<p>We will go into more depth about each individual package as we use their awesome features in future chapters. The focus in this chapter is to verify the specific libraries are available, and there are a few different approaches to use such as inspecting the installation folder for specific files on your workstation or running commands from a Python command line. I find the easiest method is to run a few simple commands in a new notebook.</p>
<p>Navigate back to the <kbd>notebooks</kbd> folder and create a new notebook file by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">New</span> menu and select <span class="packt_screen">Python 3</span> in the submenu to create a default <kbd>Untitled</kbd> notebook. To stay consistent with best practices, be sure to rename the notebook <kbd>verify_python_packages</kbd> before moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="uuid-cae74397-0919-4b82-aaf7-3c5fcacf7eb3">Checking for pandas</h2>
<p>The steps to verify whether each Python package is available are similar with slight variations to the code. The first one will be <kbd>pandas</kbd>, which will make it easier to complete common data analysis techniques such as pivoting, cleaning, merging and grouping datasets all in one place without going back to the source of record.</p>
<p>To verify whether the <kbd>pandas</kbd> library is available in Jupyter, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type in<span> </span><kbd>import pandas as pd</kbd><span> </span>in the<span> </span><kbd>In []:</kbd><span> </span>cell.</li>
<li>Run the cell using the preferred method discussed earlier in the <em>Installing Python and using Jupyter Notebook</em> section:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px"><span>Click the button from the toolbar.</span></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Select <span class="packt_screen">Run Cells</span> <span>from the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span><span> menu.</span></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Press the <em>Shift </em><span>+ </span><em>Enter</em><span> or</span> <em>Ctrl </em><span>+ </span><em>Enter</em><span> keys.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Type in the<span> </span><kbd>np.__version__</kbd><span> </span>command in the next<span> </span><kbd>In []:</kbd><span> </span>cell.</li>
<li>Run the cell using the preferred method from <em>step 2</em>.</li>
<li>Verify the output cell displayed as<span> </span><kbd>Out []</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">The version of <kbd>pandas</kbd> should be <strong>0.18.0</strong> or greater.</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Now you will repeat these steps for each of the following required packages used in this book: <kbd>numpy</kbd>, <kbd>sklearn</kbd>, <kbd>matplotlib</kbd>, and <kbd>scipy</kbd>. Note that I have used the commonly known shortcut names for each library to make it consistent with best practices found in the industry.</p>
<p>For example, <kbd>pandas</kbd> has been shortened to <kbd>pd</kbd>, so as you call features from each library, you can just use the shortcut name.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Additional packages can and should be used depending on the type of analysis required, variations of the data input, and advancement of the Python ecosystem.</div>
<h2 id="uuid-a1e0aea8-6ac0-428f-ad88-5a9011d96ee8">Checking for NumPy</h2>

<h1 id="uuid-7590c090-9b66-4b56-a280-029621b74cc3">Summary</h1>
<p>Congratulations, we have now set up an environment that's ready to work with data. We started by installing Python and the Jupyter Notebook app by using the <kbd>conda</kbd> package installer called Anaconda. Next, we launched the Jupyter app and discussed how to navigate all of the features of both the dashboard and a notebook. We created a working directory that can be used as a template for all data analysis projects. </p>
<p>We ran our first Python code by creating a <kbd>hello_world</kbd> notebook and walk through the core features available in Jupyter. Finally, we verified and explored different Python packages (NumPy, pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, and SciPy) and their purposes in data analysis. You should now be comfortable and ready to run additional Python code commands in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will expand your data literacy skills with some hands-on lessons. We will discuss the foundational library of NumPy, which is used for the analysis of data structures called arrays. </p>
