The next step is to present it on a map, accurately disclosing thematic content and features. For this purpose, various techniques of visual design, or styling layers based on their attributes, are used in GIS. QGIS has incredibly broad and flexible capabilities of cartographic visualization and data styling.</p><p>In this chapter, we will go through the following topics and skills:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Good practices with respect to data organization within a single working document (project)</li><li class="listitem">Visual representation of data, revealing its thematic and spatial features</li><li class="listitem">Layer labeling, which is done to enhance data readability</li><li class="listitem">Control over styles</li><li class="listitem">Base maps used to provide spatial context and a background for your data</li></ul></div><p>The main result of this chapter will be a project, designed according to the basic requirements of cartographic visualization.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Loading layers from the spatial database</h1></div></div></div><p>Throughout this <a id="id85" class="indexterm"/>chapter, we will use the database that we created earlier. As you remember, this is a SpatiaLite file database. In order to work with it, we must first establish a connection and then load the data. As always, there are <a id="id86" class="indexterm"/>a few alternative ways of doing this in QGIS:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">From the menu, go to <strong>Layer</strong> | <strong>Add Layer</strong> | <strong>Add SpatiaLite Layer</strong></li><li class="listitem">
Click on <img src="img/image00305.jpeg" alt="Loading layers from the spatial database"/>, the <strong>Add SpatiaLite Layer</strong> button, in the <strong>Manage Layers</strong> toolbar
</li><li class="listitem">Use the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>L</em> keyboard shortcut</li></ul></div><p>In the opened window, define the database you want to connect to by following these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">If you have<a id="id87" class="indexterm"/> created the database as was described in the previous chapter, you are likely to notice that it has already been connected. If it is not, then click on the <strong>New</strong> button and navigate to the <code class="literal">.sqlite</code> file you want to work with.</li><li class="listitem">After the<a id="id88" class="indexterm"/> database file is selected, click on the <strong>Connect</strong> button to see the list of available layers. You will see the layers' names and geometry types.</li><li class="listitem">Select the necessary layer (or layers, which is done by holding down the <em>Ctrl</em> key) and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"/>Note</h3><p>The <strong>Set filter</strong> button gives you more flexibility when adding the data, as it provides access to the <strong>Query Builder</strong> window, where you can make up a conditional expression to define the sub-dataset, as shown in the following figure. For example, if you want to select a <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>multipurpose play area (MPPA) from the <code class="literal">athletic facilities</code> dataset, you can do the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">On the left side of the <strong>Query Builder</strong> window, select a necessary field called <code class="literal">primary_sp</code> (double-click on its name to add to the expression in the <strong>Provider specific filter expression</strong> textbox)</li><li class="listitem">Type in or click on the operator button (the equality sign in our case)</li><li class="listitem">Load the field values by clicking on the <strong>All</strong> button, and double-click on an <code class="literal">MPPA</code> value to add it to the expression</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Provider specific filter expression</strong> textbox, you will see the following line: <code class="literal">"primary_sp" = 'MPPA'</code></li></ul></div><p>Test the query. If it returns a meaningful result, click on <strong>OK</strong>. After returning to the main window, you will see the condition beside the <strong>geom</strong> column. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to load the layers.</p></div><div><img src="img/image00306.jpeg" alt="Loading layers from the spatial database"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li></ol><div></div><p>Loading layers is <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>even simpler from the <strong>Browser</strong> panel. To see the available layers, successively<a id="id91" class="indexterm"/> expand <strong>SpatiaLite</strong> and the relevant database item. Now you can just drag and drop the layers onto the map canvas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Grouping and reordering layers</h1></div></div></div><p>By default, layers<a id="id92" class="indexterm"/> are loaded<a id="id93" class="indexterm"/> in alphabetical order (reversely if you add them from the browser panel). Each new layer is laid on top of the previous layer and covers it. By default, all layers are turned on, styled with simple uniform symbols, and randomly assigned colors. The order of layers can be changed by simply dragging and dropping them up and down the legend. Also, it is strongly advisable to order and arrange layers in some logical groups, as it simplifies the navigation and understanding of data.</p><p>To manage<a id="id94" class="indexterm"/> and rearrange layers and maintain their visibility, use the <strong>Layer</strong> toolbar in the <strong>Layers</strong> panel, which is shown in the following screenshot and contains the buttons described afterwards (in the order of appearance from left to right):</p><div><img src="img/image00307.jpeg" alt="Grouping and reordering layers"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Add Group</strong>: This <a id="id95" class="indexterm"/>creates an empty layers group.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Manage Layer Visibility</strong>: This allows us to quickly show and hide layers and also customize their visibility with predefined layer combinations—so-called presets.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Filter Legend By Map Content</strong>: If the filter is active, layer legend only shows those items that are actually visible inside the map canvas. All other symbols are hidden from the legend.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Expand All</strong> / <strong>Collapse All</strong>: Buttons are used to expand or collapse layers, symbology legends, and layer groups, if any.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Remove Layer/Group</strong>: This removes the selected legend entries.</li></ul></div><p>There are two ways of creating a layer group:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
Click on <img src="img/image00308.jpeg" alt="Grouping and reordering layers"/>, the <strong>Add Group</strong> button, from the <strong>Layers</strong> toolbar. A new group will appear at the bottom of the list of layers. Type in an appropriate name and then drag and drop the layers into the group.
</li><li class="listitem">Select several layers while holding down the <em>Ctrl</em> key, and use the <strong>Group Selected</strong> right-click contextual shortcut to place them in a single group.</li></ul></div><p>It is possible to develop a multilevel hierarchy with subgroups by selecting groups and applying <strong>Add Group</strong> to them. Any item of the layer legend, whether it's a single layer or a group, can be renamed with the <strong>Rename</strong> right-click shortcut. Renaming doesn't affect the dataset itself, but allows us to apply to it a proper and meaningful name within a project. Now<a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> try arranging the layers into several meaningful groups yourself, and name<a id="id97" class="indexterm"/> them appropriately.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Developing your own styles</h1></div></div></div><p>In QGIS, a style is a way of cartographic visualization that takes into account a layer's individual and<a id="id98" class="indexterm"/> thematic features. It encompasses basic characteristics of symbology, such as the color and presence of fill, outline parameters, the use of markers, scale-dependent rendering, layer transparency, interactions with other layers, and labels.</p><p>A well-chosen style greatly simplifies data perception and readability, so it is important to learn how to work with styles in order to be capable of representing your data in the best way. In this section, we will discuss vector and raster layers separately, as their stylization has some unique features.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"/>Developing styles for vector layers</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Style</strong> menu from the <strong>Layer Properties</strong> dialog provides you with all the necessary tools to symbolize and <a id="id99" class="indexterm"/>style your data. To open it, double-click<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> on a layer name in the <strong>Layers</strong> panel, or use the <strong>Properties</strong> right-click contextual shortcut, and select the <strong>Style</strong> section. You will see something similar to this:</p><div><img src="img/image00309.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The very first<a id="id101" class="indexterm"/> thing you should pay your attention to is the small <strong>Renderer</strong> drop-down type list in the top-left corner. It contains the following items:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Single Symbol</strong>: This is the simplest type that draws all the layer features with the same symbol.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Categorized</strong>: This defines data-driven categories and allows us to symbolize them individually.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Graduated</strong>: This <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/>defines the categories based on quantitative attributes, allowing us to rank features gradually.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Rule-based</strong>: This is the most flexible and advanced renderer type. It allows the user to define their own categories using multiple criteria and style them individually.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Point displacement</strong>: This renderer is useful when you are working with a point layer containing overlapping points that have similar coordinates or are located too close to each other. It is available only for single point layers, and will automatically shift the location of the markers so that all overlapping markers are visible.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Inverted polygons</strong>: These are used to style the area exterior to the polygon, and are available for polygon layers only.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Heatmap</strong>: This represents a point layer with a continuous surface according to the points' density, It is available for point layers only.</li></ul></div><p>Depending on the renderer type selected, the <strong>Style</strong> menu section changes its view, and if you mistakenly select an inappropriate type (for example, the heat map renderer for a line layer), you will get the corresponding message.</p><p>After the renderer<a id="id103" class="indexterm"/> type is chosen, you can start adjusting the symbology with the <strong>Symbol selector</strong> dialog, whose accessibility depends on the renderer<a id="id104" class="indexterm"/> type selected. For example, for the <strong>Single symbol</strong> and the <strong>Inverted polygons</strong> renderer, this dialog is directly available from the <strong>Style</strong> section. For the <strong>Categorized</strong> and <strong>Graduated</strong> renderers, it is available from the <strong>Symbol Change</strong> button, which looks like this: <img src="img/image00310.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/>.</p><p><strong>Rule-based</strong>, <strong>Point displacement</strong>, and <strong>Heatmap</strong> renderers have their own specifications for symbology selection and adjustment, which will be covered in the following sections. Nevertheless, regardless of the renderer type selected (except the <strong>Heatmap</strong> renderer), you always have access to the <strong>Symbol selector</strong> dialog, which looks similar to what is shown in the following screenshot and consists of several sections:</p><div><img src="img/image00311.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In the top-left part of the window, you can see a symbol preview. Underneath the preview, there are symbol layers. By default, only one layer is used, but you can add more with the <strong>Add symbol layer</strong> button, <img src="img/image00312.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/>, or remove unnecessary layers with the <strong>Remove symbol layer</strong> button, <img src="img/image00313.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/>, which is active only if there are two or more layers available. With the <strong>Lock layer's color</strong> button, <img src="img/image00314.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/>, the layer's <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>color will be locked for changes, which prevents<a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> colors from being modified by a categorized or graduated renderer. Layers can be reordered with the <strong>Move up</strong> (<img src="img/image00315.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/>) and <strong>Move down</strong> (<img src="img/image00316.jpeg" alt="Developing styles for vector layers"/>) buttons, and if you are satisfied with the result, <strong>use the Save symbol button</strong> in the symbol library.</p><p>In the right-hand side of the dialog window, there are options available for the symbol layer selected. Among them, <strong>Symbol layer type</strong> is the most important. The list of available types depends on the layer geometry. For a polygon layer, you can select from the following list:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Centroid fill</strong>: Polygons are symbolized by a marker at the polygon's centroid, instead of rendering the entire area of the polygon. This is useful if you have a lot of small polygons that are better to visualize by a point than by a tiny polygon that is visible only after zooming in.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Gradient fill</strong>: Use a predefined gradient or create a custom gradient to fill the polygon.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Line pattern fill</strong>: Line patterns can be combined to create various hatching effects. These effects are useful when you want to use the same fill color underneath but want to highlight some differences between objects with hatching.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Point pattern fill</strong>: Regularly distributed points (or other symbols) can fill the polygon and create a pattern.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Raster image fill</strong>: Any raster image can be used to create a background-filling texture <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>or pattern.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>SVG fill</strong>: A scalable vector graphics <code class="literal">.svg</code> file (or a marker) can be used to create a filling texture or pattern.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Shapeburst fill</strong>: This shades the interior of a polygon, depending on the distance from the edge of the polygon, and creates amazing border buffering effects.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Simple fill</strong>: This the default type, and is characterized by fill color, pattern, and border.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Outline: marker line</strong>: A marker symbol is used as the outline.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Outline: Simple line</strong>: Only the polygon's outline is drawn and its properties defined by line color, width, and style.</li></ul></div><p>For a point layer, you <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>can choose from different marker types represented by <strong>Ellipse</strong>, letters or signs (<strong>Font marker</strong>), various markers (<strong>Simple marker</strong>), icons (<strong>SVG marker</strong>), or attribute field values (<strong>Vector Field marker</strong>).</p><p>For a line layer, the <strong>Simple</strong> and <strong>Marker line</strong> types are available. In the first case, the line is rendered as usual, and in the second, a regularly recurring marker symbol is used. <strong>Marker line</strong> can be used, for example, to show a line's direction (movement on a road, a river flow, and so on) with an arrow marker symbol.</p><p>Now that we have covered the basics, we will closely explore different rendering styles in the example of some layers from our database.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>Styling a layer with the Single Symbol renderer</h3></div></div></div><p>In this example, we <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>will use the <code class="literal">Brooklyn borough boundaries</code> layer to outline the area of interest on the map. As you can see in the following<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> screenshot, we use two symbol layers, both defined as <strong>Outline: Simple line</strong>, but with different <strong>Pen style</strong> patterns. Underneath, we place a lighter <strong>Solid line</strong> and cover it with a darker <strong>Dash Line</strong> pen style. Selecting contrast colors allows us to implement a border-like stripe effect.</p><div><img src="img/image00317.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Single Symbol renderer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec02"/>Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's style the <code class="literal">public schools</code> layer to reflect the school type:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">After setting the<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> renderer type to <strong>Categorized</strong>, select the column with the categories to be rendered under<strong> Column</strong>. The column is available from the drop-down list that contains all the<a id="id112" class="indexterm"/> layer attribute fields. As we want school types to be shown as categories, select the <code class="literal">sch_type</code> field to categorize the layer:<div><img src="img/image00318.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Symbol Change</strong> button to adjust the layer symbology. In the <strong>Symbol selector</strong> window, set <strong>Symbol layer type</strong> to <strong>SVG marker</strong> and navigate to the training dataset catalog called <code class="literal">svg</code>. Select the <code class="literal">school.svg</code> file and adjust the symbol's <strong>Size</strong> value to <code class="literal">3</code> mm. Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button to come back to the main window:<div><img src="img/image00319.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Classify</strong> button. The window with the <strong>Symbol</strong>, <strong>Value</strong>, and <strong>Legend</strong> columns will automatically be populated with the categories and their descriptions from the attribute field. The difference between <strong>Value</strong> and <strong>Legend</strong> is that<a id="id113" class="indexterm"/> values represent unique attributes, while the legend provides their descriptive characteristics. It's more obvious when values, for example, are some codes and the legend is supposed to explain their meaning. Also, values are not visible in the<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/> layer's legend, but their descriptions are. You can add or delete the categories, or manually edit the text of its elements (<strong>Value</strong> or <strong>Legend</strong>) by double-clicking on the item in the relevant column. For now, just click on <strong>OK</strong> to exit the <strong>Style</strong> dialog and take a look at the preliminary result.</li><li class="listitem">You will see that the symbols on the map canvas are too dense and overlapped, which makes the map cluttered. To enhance readability, we should relate the appearance of symbols with a scale, and there are two basic approaches to do this:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Activate <strong>Scale dependent visibility</strong> from the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <strong>Properties</strong> window, where you should enter values of <strong>Minimum (exclusive)</strong> and <strong>Maximum (inclusive)</strong> scales. For example, if you define the values, as shown in the following screenshot, the<a id="id115" class="indexterm"/> layer will become visible within a scale range of 1:49,999 (because the minimum value of <code class="literal">50000</code> is excluded) and more. This approach doesn't affect the symbol's size. It only regulates the scale range for its appearance while zooming in and out of the<a id="id116" class="indexterm"/> map canvas:<div><img src="img/image00320.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem">
The other approach, which we will actually use, is more sophisticated because it makes the symbol size dependent on the scale. To apply it, open the <strong>Style</strong> dialog in the <strong>Properties</strong> window, and click on <img src="img/image00321.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/>, the <strong>Symbol</strong><strong>Change</strong> button, to open the <strong>Symbol selector</strong> dialog, as shown. Activate the necessary symbol layer, change its <strong>Size</strong> units to <strong>Map unit</strong>, and enter <code class="literal">30</code>. This means that the symbol size will be set 30 feet and changed according to the scale while zooming in or out. Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button to come back to the main window.
<div><img src="img/image00322.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip08"/>Tip</h3><p>In this case, the scale range can be defined through the <strong>Adjust scaling range</strong> button (<img src="img/image00323.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/>), which opens a dialog window to define the minimum and maximum scale values.</p></div></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">By default, all categories are assigned the same <strong>Symbol</strong> marker according to the SVG file selected, but you can modify it by <a id="id117" class="indexterm"/>double-clicking and adjusting the necessary properties (that is, <strong>Fill</strong> and <strong>Border</strong>) in the <strong>Symbol selector</strong> dialog. Also, right-clicking on any item brings up a contextual menu with the <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Paste</strong>, <strong>Change color</strong>, <strong>Change transparency</strong>, <strong>Change output unit</strong>, and <strong>Change size</strong> shortcuts for simplifying some common actions.</li></ol><div></div><p>This screenshot shows what the screen may look like if you choose the <strong>Categorized</strong> renderer and adjust the settings as described previously:</p><div><img src="img/image00324.jpeg" alt="Styling a layer with the Categorized renderer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>After you've clicked on the <strong>OK</strong> button, the layer's style properties will be applied, and you can explore<a id="id118" class="indexterm"/> the layer visibility in the map canvas. In the case of map unit related symbol size, you will probably not be able to see markers while zooming out, but they will appear on larger scales, changing in size accordingly. Note that the symbols in the layer's legend<a id="id119" class="indexterm"/> on the <strong>Layers</strong> panel behave similarly, that is, become larger on larger scales and shrink on smaller scales. This helps you know whether the layer is visible on this scale, and if it is, helps you see the appearance of its markers.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec03"/>Styling a layer with the Graduated renderer</h3></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Graduated</strong> renderer<a id="id120" class="indexterm"/> type is useful when you want to grade features according to some quantitative attribute. In our sample dataset, we have<a id="id121" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">zipcodes</code> layer, which contains data about population in the <code class="literal">population</code> field.

We will explore the rule-based rendering <a id="id127" class="indexterm"/>capabilities in the example of the <code class="literal">bike routes</code> layer, which has a lot of attributes that are useful to visualize. For example, there are two fields that are of particular interest to visualize on map. The first one is <code class="literal">allclasses</code>, which contains the classification of the route types (for existing cycling facilities), based on the NYC Bicycle Master Plan classification. The types are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>I</strong>: Greenway/multi-use path.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>II</strong>: On-street striped bicycle lane.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>III</strong>: On-street signed bicycle route.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>0</strong>: Planned, but not yet existing as a bike route.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>L</strong>: Link.

Rules need to be used to combine these attributes into separate categories that show both the route type and lane count. Follow these steps to develop a Rule-based symbology for the layer:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">

Before starting, make sure that the layer is above <code class="literal">height a.s.l., ft</code>, and if not, drag it and place it properly. Hill-shading simulates how sunrays illuminate the terrain. Combining it with DEM is a very popular approach in cartographic visualization for implementing semi-3D effects and<a id="id162" class="indexterm"/> highlighting relief details. Conventionally, semi-transparent hill-shading is overlaid above the terrain layer to achieve this. As a<a id="id163" class="indexterm"/> result, the final terrain visualization loses color contrasts and becomes dull. To overcome this, we will first move the <strong>Global transparency</strong> slider to 50 percent in the <strong>Transparency</strong> section under<strong> Layer properties</strong>, and in the <strong>Style</strong> section, select <strong>Multiply</strong> from the <strong>Blending mode</strong> drop-down list. If you're not sure about what exactly has happened, try to apply <strong>Normal blending mode</strong> using <strong>Apply</strong>, and then go back to <strong>Multiply</strong>.

Click on the lowest central quadrant button to place the label centered under the symbol marker. If the label is complex, as in our case, there is a chance that it will partially overlap the symbol. To avoid overlapping, use <strong>Offset X,Y</strong>, which are the values for the label's horizontal and vertical displacement. Enter a small positive <strong>Y</strong> value (for example, <code class="literal">3.0</code>) to move the label slightly lower.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, in the <strong>Rendering</strong> section, activate <strong>Scale-based visibility</strong> and enter <code class="literal">10000</code> in the denominator for the maximum possible scale.

You can also use <strong>Discourage labels from covering features</strong>. As a result, your map will look neater. Depending on the labeling options you have chosen, your labeled layer may look similar to the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/image00354.jpeg" alt="Labeling a point layer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"/>Labeling a line layer</h2></div></div></div><p>The process of labeling a<a id="id173" class="indexterm"/> line layer is similar to the one described previously, but<a id="id174" class="indexterm"/> in the <strong>Placement</strong> section, you can find some line-specific options. The most important options are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Parallel</strong>: The label is adjusted along a direction parallel to the major direction of the labeled line. This type of placement is good for conveying line curvature, but can miss small details.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Curved</strong>: The label will be curved so as to reflect an original line's curvature. This is the best choice for labeling objects with complex geometry, such as rivers and pathways.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Horizontal</strong>: Regardless of the line orientation, the label is always placed horizontally.</li></ul></div><p>Labels can be placed above, on, or below line respectively. In the case of on-line placement, the line will be partially overlapped by the label. If you select several options at once, QGIS will define the best position and even take into account the line direction with <strong>Line orientation</strong><a id="id175" class="indexterm"/> <strong>dependent position</strong> activated. The <strong>Distance</strong> option defines how far from the line the<a id="id176" class="indexterm"/> label will be placed (it is active only for <strong>Above/ On line</strong> positions). The maximum angle between curved characters defines how far you can bend a label. In the <strong>Rendering</strong> sections, the main line-specific options are located within <strong>Feature options</strong>. For example, here you can use <strong>Merge connected lines to avoid duplicate labels</strong>, which is very useful for working with a road network. With <strong>Suppress labeling feature smaller than</strong>, you can set up the values for small features to be ignored during labeling.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"/>Labeling a polygon layer</h2></div></div></div><p>In this section, we<a id="id177" class="indexterm"/> will add labels to the <code class="literal">zipocodes</code> layer:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Activate labeling and select the <code class="literal">zipcode</code> field to add labels.</li><li class="listitem">In the text section, set <strong>Font</strong> to <strong>Harlow Solid Italic</strong> (or any other font you like) and enter <code class="literal">10</code><a id="id178" class="indexterm"/> under <strong>Size</strong>.

It provides <a id="id181" class="indexterm"/>advanced control over labeling parameters. You can do this with an expression or by using a specially created attribute field that overrides the defined settings with custom parameters. Data-defined properties are very useful when you want to distinguish between labels for objects with different properties (for example, cities and towns with different populations) or apply your own placement positions.</p><p>Let's create three types of <code class="literal">zipcode</code> labels depending on population. The smaller label will be for areas where the population is less than 40000, the medium-sized label will be for a population of 40000-80000, and the biggest will be for a population of over 80000.</p><p>This means that we<a id="id182" class="indexterm"/> need to adjust the <strong>Size</strong> value of the font according to the <code class="literal">population</code> field values. From the <strong>Data defined override</strong> contextual menu, select <strong>Edit…</strong>, like this:</p><div><img src="img/image00356.jpeg" alt="Advanced labeling"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In <strong>Expression string builder</strong>, enter the expression shown in the following screenshot.

For example, from the following screenshot, which shows an explanation of the color input, we can conclude that if we want to change the label color according to the population, we can use <code class="literal">case when "population" &gt; 80000 then '255,0,0,0' else '25,81,119,0' end</code>:</p><div><img src="img/image00358.jpeg" alt="Advanced labeling"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>Managing styles</h1></div></div></div><p>As you can see from the previous section, developing styles is a time-consuming task. But the good thing is that<a id="id184" class="indexterm"/> once developed, styles are not lost. They can be saved, applied to other layers, and imported from and exported to external sources.</p><p>The main style management options are available from the <strong>Style</strong> button at the bottom row of the <strong>Style</strong> section under <strong>Properties</strong> as shown. The menu is divided into sections separated by horizontal lines. The first section is responsible for loading and saving styles. The second and third are for managing multiple styles for the layer, and at the bottom is the toggle for activating different styles (inactive and grayed out by default, when there's only one style available).</p><div><img src="img/image00359.jpeg" alt="Managing styles"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"/>Tip</h3><p>You can get access to some of these options by right-clicking on the layer's <strong>Styles</strong> contextual shortcut. For example, you can copy and paste a style from one layer to another, add a new style, or rename an existing style. Also, this is very convenient for rapid switching between multiple layer styles.</p></div><p>When you have finished polishing your style, it is wise to save it. There are three main options for doing this from the <strong>Style</strong> button of the <strong>Save Style</strong> menu:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>QGIS Layer Style File</strong>: The style is saved as a <code class="literal">.qml</code> file, which is a native QGIS format for storing styles.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>SLD File</strong>: The style is exported to a style layer descriptor (<code class="literal">.sld</code>) file. This file type converts the original symbology into a single-symbol or rule-based type. This means categorized, graduated, heatmap, and other types of symbology may not be supported properly. Renderer-based symbology may not be supported properly. It may be convenient to save the symbology in an <code class="literal">.sld</code> file if you plan to work on it within an external application, such as GeoServer.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Save in database</strong>: We use this option to store and distribute all our data and styles within a single SpatiaLite database. When loading a style, it is important to provide a meaningful name and an exhaustive description. This is very handy because if you want somebody else to work with your data and style it properly, they just need to connect to the database, load the spatial layers and styles, and apply them.</li></ul></div><p>Once the style is saved, you <a id="id185" class="indexterm"/>can use <strong>Load from file</strong> (<strong>Style</strong> | <strong>Load Style</strong> | <strong>Load from file</strong>) or <strong>Load from database</strong> to select and apply the style.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"/>Note</h3><p>The QGIS community is very active in developing resources and eager to share them, so instead of spending a long time developing your own styles, you can apply ready styles provided by various users.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>Adding base maps</h1></div></div></div><p>Base maps are ready-to-use background maps that provide contextual and spatial information additional to your data. They can be satellite imagery, general maps from various sources, or<a id="id192" class="indexterm"/> even self-prepared custom maps. In this section, we will take a look at the most popular types of background maps and how to load them into QGIS to combine them with your data.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec24"/>The OpenLayers plugin</h2></div></div></div><p>This is one of the most popular QGIS plugins, as it allows simple addition of base maps from numerous popular map providers (OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, Bing Maps, and so on). Install the <a id="id193" class="indexterm"/>plugin as described in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Handling Your Data" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S2">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Handling Your Data</em>, and make sure that it's active after installation.</p><p>Loading base maps is<a id="id194" class="indexterm"/> simple; go to <strong>Web</strong> | <strong>OpenLayers</strong>, select the provider, and click on the map you want to add. The map will be loaded into the map canvas and appear in the <strong>Layers</strong> panel. By default, layers are added to the first layer group, but you can drag and drop them wherever you want. The layer can be shown or hidden with the toggle beside its name, and deleted from the project with the <strong>Remove</strong> right-click contextual shortcut.</p><p>You can gain extended control over layers and navigation by activating the <strong>OpenLayers Overview</strong> panel from the menu. The panel will appear in the bottom-left corner under the <strong>Layers</strong> panel.</p><div><img src="img/image00362.jpeg" alt="The OpenLayers plugin"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Activate the <strong>Enable map</strong> toggle and select a map for overview from the drop-down list. You can use two different maps in the overview window and the map canvas window for comparison. If you want to load the map into the canvas, click on the <strong>Add map</strong> button beside the drop-down list. For<a id="id195" class="indexterm"/> simpler navigation, there is a red cross in the main map window. It marks the center of the overview extent. You can hide it by clicking on the corresponding toggle. Also, the overview map can be saved as a <code class="literal">.jpeg</code> image, or a rectangular extent can be copied to the clipboard as KML.</p><p>The <strong>OpenLayers</strong> plugin is very useful because of its numerous maps and simplicity, but there are a number of constraints you should pay attention to while working with it. First of all, this plugin is aimed at providing base maps only, and before using it to perform other tasks, it is highly recommended to study the provider's licensing terms. Secondly, note that adding any layer from the plugin's list automatically changes the original map projection to <strong>EPSG: 3857 WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator</strong>.</p><p>This is because the plugin fetches data originally provided in EPSG: 3857, and instead of reprojecting, it suppresses map projection and automatically reprojects the user's data. Last but not least is the fact that with the OpenLayers plugin, you cannot rely on scale and map measurements. This is because the EPSG: 3857 WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator projection it uses was designed not to minimize object distortions (shape, area, distance, and so on) but to fit the entire globe in such a way that it <a id="id196" class="indexterm"/>could be shown on the web map. All measurements in this projection are performed on a sphere, and will most likely be much larger than expected. In a few words, this projection is good for visual exploration but not for measurements. To overcome these limitations, you can use other approaches.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec09"/>Adding WMS/WMTS layers</h3></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Web Map Service</strong> / <strong>Web Map Tile Service </strong>(<strong>WMS</strong>/<strong>WMTS</strong>) is a <a id="id197" class="indexterm"/>popular web-protocol for spatial information transferring To add WMS/WMTS base layer to your map perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">To load data from <a id="id198" class="indexterm"/>web services, go to <strong>Layer</strong> | <strong>Add Layer</strong> | <strong>Add WMS/WMTS</strong>, use the corresponding button in the <strong>Mange layers</strong> toolbar, or use the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>W</em> keyboard shortcut.</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Add layer(s) from a WM(T)S Server</strong> window, click on the <strong>New</strong> button to configure new connection parameters.</li><li class="listitem">In <strong>Create a new WMS Connection</strong>, enter connection details.
