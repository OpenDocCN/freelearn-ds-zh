- en: GIS has the amazing capability to help us solve real-world problems. ArcGIS
    Pro includes a wealth of tools that allow users to perform all kinds of analysis
    to answer questions, find solutions, and determine patterns. However, like most
    computer systems, the results are only as good as the quality of the data the
    analysis is based on. The old adage *garbage in, garbage out* definitely applies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do we ensure our GIS data is clean and accurate? One way is to make use
    of topology. Topology is a model of how features are related to one another spatially.
    Are they adjacent, connected, or coincident? This should not be confused with
    topography, which is how the ground changes in elevation. ArcGIS Pro allows you
    to use two types of topology, Geodatabase and Map.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A geodatabase topology is an item you create within a geodatabase, which allows
    you to apply rules to the data that is part of the topology. This might include
    rules such as: polygons must not overlap, lines must not intersect, or points
    must be inside a polygon. The rules are then used to validate the data to locate
    any features that violate the rules. ArcGIS Pro includes tools that allow you
    to fix the errors that are found. To make use of geodatabase topologies, you must
    store your data in a geodatabase, the feature classes must be in the same feature
    dataset, and you must have a standard or advanced license.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to being able to validate data with geodatabase topology, ArcGIS
    Pro provides tools to help you edit data so as to not introduce new errors into
    your data. These topology edits allow you to edit multiple features so that whatever
    their existing spatial relationship happens to be, it is maintained after the
    edit. This can not only keep your data clean, but also greatly increases your
    editing efficiency because you can edit multiple features with a single edit operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Map topologies are not as complex as geodatabase topologies. They are temporary,
    only existing during a given ArcGIS Pro session when you have a map open. Map
    topologies do not allow you to validate your data to find errors. What they allow
    you to do is perform edits to existing data, using topology edit tools, so that
    the edited features maintain their current spatial relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Map topologies are not limited to only data in a geodatabase or in a single-feature
    dataset. Geodatabase feature classes and shapefiles can all be included in a single
    Map topology. Another advantage of the Map topology is that it works at all licensing
    levels, so you can use them even with just a Basic license.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you will learn how to create a new Geodatabase topology. This
    will include adding rules and feature classes to it. Then you will validate the
    feature classes that take part in the topology to find the errors. Next you will
    use topology tools to fix the errors and validate again to ensure your edits have
    not introduced new errors. Lastly, you will explore a Map topology and how you
    can use it to edit multiple features at one time.

- en: A geodatabase topology is an item stored in a geodatabase, just like a feature
    class or table. They can only exist and function within a geodatabase. Other formats,
    such as shapefiles, do not support geodatabase topologies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like feature classes and tables, you must create the topology. This will include
    giving it a name, setting tolerances, adding rules, and adding participating feature
    classes. To create a new geodatabase topology, a couple of things must be true.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, you can only create a geodatabase topology within a feature dataset.
    Second, only feature classes stored in the feature dataset containing the topology
    can participate in that topology. Third, participating feature classes must not be part
    of another topology or geometric network. A feature class can only participate
    in one topology or geometric network at a time. Lastly, you must have a Standard
    or Advanced license of ArcGIS Pro in order to create a new topology.

- en: In this recipe, you will create a new geodatabase topology in the Trippville
    GIS database, which will ultimately be used to validate the parcel data for the
    City. For those that have done this in the older ArcMap application, you will
    find the ArcGIS Pro process much more complex, at least in version 2.0 and version
    2.1\. This will hopefully be more streamlined in future versions.

- en: The Cluster Tolerance is the distance at which ArcGIS Pro believes features
    should be considered to be in the same location. When you validate the topology,
    ArcGIS Pro will automatically snap features together that are within the cluster
    tolerance distance. This means that when you validate, it will potentially move
    data. This is both good and bad. It will often clean up data by connecting features
    that were mistakenly not connected. It will remove small gaps and overlaps between
    features. However, if your cluster tolerance is set to large, it could snap features
    together that should not be. So, it is generally recommended to keep the cluster
    tolerance small. Esri indicates that the best practice is to use the default tolerance
    calculated by ArcGIS Pro, as it is typically small enough to avoid any adverse
    effects to your data.

- en: You have now seen how powerful geodatabase topologies can be to help you find
    and correct errors in your data. However, to use geodatabase topologies, your
    data must be stored in a geodatabase and you must have a standard or advanced
    license. So, what do you do if you want to maintain data which is stored in a
    shapefile so that you do not introduce topological errors, or if you only have
    a basic license? This is where a Map topology should be used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As said in the introduction, map topologies are temporary and do not allow you
    to validate data using rules. What they do allow you to do, though, is edit data
    using topology tools so that the existing spatial relationships are maintained.
    This keeps you from introducing any new errors into your data. Map topologies
    also have the advantage of allowing these topology editing tools to be used on
    shapefiles and geodatabase feature class-based layers at the same time. Being
    able to edit multiple layers with single edits, regardless of whether it is a
    shapefile or geodatabase, can greatly increase your efficiency. Map topologies
    also do not require all the geodatabase feature classes to be in the same feature
    dataset within the geodatabase. So, while map topologies do not allow you to validate
    your data like geodatabase topologies do, they do offer greater data flexibility.

    in the Trippville GIS geodatabase you have been working with. However, the Voting
    Districts are stored in a shapefile because the voter registration system, which
    needs the layer, cannot read a geodatabase.
