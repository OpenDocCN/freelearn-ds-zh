Interface components can include buttons, tools, toolbars, menus, combo boxes, tool palettes, and application extensions. The add-in concept was first introduced in ArcGIS Desktop 10.0 and could be created with .NET or Java. However, with the release of ArcGIS 10.1, add-ins can now be created with Python. Add-ins are created using Python scripts and an XML file that defines how the user interface should appear. </p><p>Add-ins provide an easy way to distribute user interface customizations to end users. No installation programs are necessary. A single compressed file with a file extension of <code class="literal">.esriaddin</code> is copied to a well-known folder, and ArcGIS Desktop handles the rest. To simplify the development even further, a Python Add-In wizard has been provided by Esri. You can download the wizard from the Esri website. We'll do that in our first recipe in this chapter.</p><p>There are a number of add-in types that can be created. Buttons and tools are the simplest type of add-ins that you can create. Buttons simply execute business logic when clicked. Tools are similar to buttons but require interaction with the map before the business logic is executed. Combo boxes provide a list of choices for the user to select from. </p><p>There are also a number of container objects including menus, toolbars, tool palettes, and application extensions. Menus act as a container for buttons or other menus. Toolbars are a container for buttons, tools, combo boxes, tool palettes, and menus. They are the most versatile of the add-in container types. Tool palettes also act as a container for tools, and need to be added to a toolbar before the tools will be exposed. Finally, application extensions are the most complex add-in type. This type of add-in coordinates activities between other components and is responsible for listening for and responding to various events, such as the addition or removal of a layer from a data frame. </p></div></div></div>

To create a project using the Python Add-In wizard, you select a working directory, enter various project settings, and click on the <strong>Save</strong> button. Creation of the add-in then follows a well-defined process, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4445OT_11_04a.jpg" alt="Getting ready"/></div><p>You must first create a container for the add-in and this can be either a toolbar or a menu. Next, create the button, tool, or another add-in that you want to add to the container. In this recipe, we'll just assume it's a button. Next, you need to edit the Python script associated with the button. You'll also want to test the button to make sure it works as expected. Finally, you can share the add-in with others. In this recipe, you'll learn how to use the Add-In wizard to create a button add-in for ArcGIS Desktop. The button add-in will run a custom script tool that you created in an earlier recipe, which loads wildfire data from a text file to a point feature class.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec205"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><p>Follow these steps to learn how to create a button add-in:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the ArcGIS Python Add-In wizard by double-clicking on the <code class="literal">addin_assistant.exe</code> file located in the <code class="literal">bin</code> folder, where you extracted the wizard.</li><li class="listitem">Create a new project folder called <code class="literal">Wildfire_Addin</code> and click <strong>OK</strong>:<div><img src="img/4445_11_4.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">The <a id="id769" class="indexterm"/><strong>Project Settings</strong> tab should be active initially and display the working directory you just created.

<strong>Toolbar</strong> add-in, while it doesn't do a whole lot functionally, is very important because it acts as a container for other add-ins such as buttons, tools, combo boxes, tool palettes, and menus. Toolbars can be floating or docked. Creating a toolbar add-in is easy using the Python Add-In wizard. </p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Now, we'll add a button by right-clicking on the new <strong>Wildfire Toolbar</strong> option and selecting <strong>New Button</strong>. </li><li class="listitem">Fill in the button details including a caption, class name, ID, tooltip, and others.

However, behind the scenes, the wizard creates a set of folders and files for the add-in. The add-in file structure is really quite simple. Two folders and a set of files comprise the add-in structure. You can see this structure in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4445_11_13.jpg" alt="How it works..."/></div><p>The <code class="literal">Images</code> <a id="id779" class="indexterm"/> folder contains any icons or other image files used by your add-in. In this recipe, we used the <code class="literal">wildfire.png</code> image. So, this file should now be in the <code class="literal">Images</code> folder. The <code class="literal">Install</code> folder contains the Python script that handles the business logic of the add-in. This is the file you work with extensively to code the add-in. It performs whatever business logic needs to be performed by the buttons, tools, menu items, and so on. The <code class="literal">config.xml</code> file<a id="id780" class="indexterm"/> in the main folder of the add-in defines the user interface and any static properties such as the name, author, version, and so on. The <code class="literal">makeaddin.py</code> file<a id="id781" class="indexterm"/> can be double-clicked to create the <code class="literal">.esriaddin</code> file, which wraps everything into a compressed file with an <code class="literal">.esriaddin</code> extension. This <code class="literal">.esriaddin</code> file is what will be distributed to end users, so that the add-in can be installed. </p></div></div></div>

You can then go into ArcGIS Desktop and test the add-in. The custom toolbar or menu may already be visible and ready to test.

An interaction with the map can be a number of things including clicking on the map, drawing a polygon or rectangle, or performing various mouse or key events. Python code is written to respond to one or more of these events. In this recipe, you learned how to write code that responds to the<a id="id805" class="indexterm"/> <a id="id806" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">onRectangle()</code> event. You also set various properties inside the constructor for the add-in including <code class="literal">cursor</code> and <code class="literal">shape</code>, which will be drawn on the<a id="id807" class="indexterm"/> map.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec213"/>There's more…</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a number of additional add-ins that you can create. The <code class="literal">ComboBox</code> add-in<a id="id808" class="indexterm"/> provides a drop-down list of values that the user can select from, or alternatively they can type a new value into an editable field. As with the other add-ins, you'll first want to create a new project with the Python Add-In wizard, add a new toolbar, and then create a combo box to add to the toolbar. </p><p>The Tool Palette provides a way of grouping related tools. It does need to be added to an existing toolbar. By default, tools will be added to the palette in a grid-like pattern. </p><p>The <code class="literal">Menu</code> add-in acts as a container for buttons and other menus. Menus, in addition to being displayed by the ArcGIS Desktop Add-in Manager, will also be displayed in the <strong>Customize</strong> dialog box for ArcGIS Desktop. </p><p>Application extensions are used to add specific sets of related functionality to ArcGIS Desktop. Several examples include Spatial Analyst, 3D Analyst, and Business Analyst. Typically, application extensions are responsible for listening for events and handling them. For example, you could create an application extension that saves the map document file each time a user adds a layer to the map. Application extensions also coordinate activities between components.</p></div></div></div>
