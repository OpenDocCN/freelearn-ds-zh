In this chapter, you will be exposed to the basics of visibility analysis through defining the roof that provides the most scenic view of an area, and where the viewing platform can potentially be located. Throughout the chapter, you will learn how to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Prepare data to represent urban landscape features</li><li class="listitem">Select potential observation points</li><li class="listitem">Compute the viewsheds to find the most scenic points</li><li class="listitem">Present the results in a 3D scene</li></ul></div><p>Before we start, we will explore some essential principles of viewshed analysis.</p><div class="section" title="The basics of visibility analysis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec41"/>The basics of visibility analysis</h1></div></div></div><p>The aim of visibility analysis is to produce a coverage of an area that can be seen from a specified location. This coverage<a id="id378" class="indexterm"/> is called a <span class="strong"><strong>viewshed</strong></span>, which is why the terms <span class="strong"><strong>visibility analysis</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>viewshed analysis</strong></span> are <a id="id379" class="indexterm"/>used interchangeably. To perform a simple visibility analysis, you need to<a id="id380" class="indexterm"/> define at least two components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Observation point</strong></span>: A point that represents<a id="id381" class="indexterm"/> an observer's position and for which visibility is being analyzed</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>DEM</strong></span>: This represents irregularities in the<a id="id382" class="indexterm"/> earth's surface and is used to examine visibility along the line of sight</li></ul></div><p>The idea underlying the process of this analysis is to compare the height of the observation point against the height of earth's surface point along the given line of sight. If the height of the surface point is less than that of the observation point, then it will be seen from the current position; if it is higher, the visibility line will be blocked. Similarly, all points within a certain radius are compared against the observation point and divided into the two categories, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Visible, with the height lower than the observation height and located below the visibility line</li><li class="listitem">Invisible, with the height higher than the observation height and located above the visibility line</li></ul></div><p>The main output of visibility analysis is a binary true/false viewshed coverage that usually includes visible points and excludes invisible points. Depending on the algorithm used and the capacity of GIS, this basic analytical approach can be modified and improved by the following<a id="id383" class="indexterm"/> features and outputs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Instead of a single observation point, multiple points and even lines can be used</li><li class="listitem">Visibility relationships between several objects can be analyzed, and then intervisibility coverage is produced as the output</li><li class="listitem">Conversely to the assessment of a viewshed for the current observation point, the earth's surface can be analyzed to provide information about points and areas from which a certain object can be seen</li><li class="listitem">A line of the horizon can be modeled as the cumulative edge of visibility zones</li><li class="listitem">Views can be bound by a horizontal or vertical viewing angle or azimuthal values that limit extension of visibility lines</li><li class="listitem">The earth's curvature and atmospheric refraction can be taken into account to simulate more realistic results</li></ul></div><p>The most typical practical application of visibility analysis is in placement of communication towers, where instead of visibility, signal penetration is modeled. Viewsheds are also of great use in territorial and urban planning. For example, some features such as factories or landfills are expected to be hidden from the human' eye because of their unsightly appearance. In this case, the area undergoes a visibility analysis to find places from where such kinds of objects can't be seen. The more the blind spots associated with a certain point, the better it is for the object's location. Furthermore, instead of hiding some objects, viewsheds are used to detect scenery points that provide the most spectacular view of an area. This knowledge is then used for optimal placement of the sight places, which is what we are going to do in this chapter.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Step 1 &#x2013; converting a buildings' vector layer to raster"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-1DOR02"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec42"/>Step 1 – converting a buildings' vector layer to raster</h1></div></div></div><p>We are going to deal with a highly urbanized landscape, whose primary features have been greatly transformed by <a id="id384" class="indexterm"/>humans. In the context of visibility analysis, this means that lines of sight are blocked mainly by buildings, while the original relief features play only a minor role. In our dataset, we have two layers that describe the area of interest, exterior, and appearance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">lidar_dem</code>: This represents the bare earth only, and provides a description of the general relief</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">building_footprints</code>: These are polygons that depict all buildings, and they also contain information about a building's height in feet above the bare earth's surface in the <code class="literal">height_roo</code> attribute field</li></ul></div><p>We need to add their values in order to obtain a meaningful result, but these layers use different data models: DEM is a raster coverage, and building footprints is a vector polygon layer. That is why before adding them, we should first take layers to a single common data model. In GIS, calculations for coverages are typically performed using raster algebra, which means that the <code class="literal">building_footprints</code> vector layer should be converted into a raster, or rasterized. Additionally, if we want this raster layer to contain data about building's height, the <code class="literal">height_roo</code> attribute field should be used as the provider of <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span> values.</p><p>It is also important that a newly created building footprint's raster has the same extent and resolution as <code class="literal">lidar_dem</code>. To get this information about <code class="literal">lidar_dem</code>, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Layer Properties</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Metadata</strong></span>. At the bottom of the window, you will see the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> scrolling window section, which contains all of the information important to know in order to work with rasters, namely <span class="strong"><strong>Band 1</strong></span> (statistics), <span class="strong"><strong>Dimensions</strong></span> (number of rows and columns), <span class="strong"><strong>Origin</strong></span> (coordinates of the bottom-left corner), and so on. The parameters of particular interest to us are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Pixel Size</strong></span>: This contains the vertical and horizontal lengths of the pixel's sides. Usually, the values are equal, which means that the pixel is a square; but sometimes, it can be rectangular, with unequal values.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Layer extent (layer original source projection)</strong></span>: This represents the minimum and maximum horizontal (<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>) and vertical (<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>) values of the raster extent, that is, the raster bounding box's northern, southern, eastern, and western limits in the layer's original coordinate reference system.</li></ul></div><p>The following screenshot shows the described parameters for the <code class="literal">lidar_dem</code> layer:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00442.jpeg" alt="Step 1 – converting a buildings' vector layer to raster"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>To rasterize a layer, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Raster</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Conversion</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Rasterize (Vector to Raster)</strong></span>.

But we have to deal with the buildings' relative height above the bare earth level. This means that, in order to summarize them with DEM, building footprints should be rasterized as an individual layer. Navigate to your working directory and type <code class="literal">building.tif</code> as a new layer name. You will be shown this message: <span class="strong"><strong>The output file doesn't exist.
