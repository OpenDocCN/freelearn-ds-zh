- en: Over time, Python has become the programming language of choice for spatial
    analysis, resulting in many packages that read, convert, analyze, and visualize
    spatial data. With so many packages available, it made sense to create a reference
    book for students and experienced professionals containing essential geospatial
    Python libraries for Python 3.

- en: 'This book also comes at an exciting moment: new technology is transforming
    how people work with geospatial data – IoT, machine learning, and data science
    are areas where geospatial data is used constantly. This explains the inclusion
    of new Python libraries, such as CARTOframes and MapboxGL, and Jupyter is included
    as well, to explore these new trends. At the same time, web and cloud-based GIS
    is increasingly becoming the new standard. This is reflected in the chapters of
    the second part of this book, where interactive geospatial web maps and REST APIs
    are introduced.'

- en: These newer libraries are combined with a number of older ones that have become
    essential over the years, and are still very popular to this day, such as Shapely,
    Rasterio, and GeoPandas. Readers who are new to this field will be given a proper
    introduction to popular libraries, putting them into perspective and comparing
    their syntax through code examples using real-world data.

- en: Finally, this books marks the transition from Python 2 to 3.x. All of the libraries
    covered in this book were written in Python 3.x so that the readers can access
    all of them using Jupyter Notebook, which is also the recommended Python coding
    environment for this book.

- en: As this book covers Python, it is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding
    of the Python language, can install Python libraries, and knows how to write and
    run Python scripts. As for additional knowledge, the first six chapters can easily
    be understood without any previous knowledge of geospatial data analysis. However,
    later chapters assume some knowledge of spatial databases, big data platforms,
    data science, web APIs, and Python web frameworks.
