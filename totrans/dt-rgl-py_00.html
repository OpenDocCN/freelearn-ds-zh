			<p>For data to be useful and meaningful, it must be curated and refined. <em class="italics">Data Wrangling with Python</em> teaches you all the core ideas behind these processes and equips you with knowledge about the most popular tools and techniques in the domain.</p>
			<p>The book starts with the absolute basics of Python, focusing mainly on data structures, and then quickly jumps into the NumPy and pandas libraries as the fundamental tools for data wrangling. We emphasize why you should stay away from the traditional way of data cleaning, as done in other languages, and take advantage of the specialized pre-built routines in Python. Thereafter, you will learn how, using the same Python backend, you can extract and transform data from a diverse array of sources, such as the internet, large database vaults, or Excel financial tables. Then, you will also learn how to handle missing or incorrect data, and reformat it based on the requirements from the downstream analytics tool. You will learn about these concepts through real-world examples and datasets. </p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be confident enough to handle a myriad of sources to extract, clean, transform, and format your data efficiently.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Installation and Setup</h3>
			<p>Each great journey begins with a humble step. Our upcoming adventure in the land of data wrangling is no exception. Before we can do awesome things with data, we need to be prepared with the most productive environment. In this short section, we shall see how to do that.</p>
			<p>The only prerequisite regarding the environment for this book is to have Docker installed. If you have never heard of Docker or you have only a very faint idea what it is, then fear not. All you need to know about Docker for the purpose of this book is this: Docker is a lightweight containerization engine that runs on all three major platforms (Linux, Windows, and macOS). The main idea behind Docker is give you safe, easy, and lightweight virtualization on top of your native OS.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Install Docker</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>To install Docker on a Mac or Windows machine, <a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>create an account on Docker and <a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>download the latest version. It's easy to install and set up.</li>
				<li>Once you have set up Docker, open a shell (or Terminal if you are a Mac user) and type the following command to verify that the installation has been successful:<pre>docker version</pre><p>If the output shows you the server and client version of Docker, then you are all set up. </p></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Pull the image</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Pull the image and you will have all the necessary packages (including Python 3.6.6) installed and ready for you to start working. Type the following command in a shell:<pre>docker pull rcshubhadeep/packt-data-wrangling-base</pre></li>
				<li>If you want to know the full list of all the packages and their versions included in this image, you can check out the <code>requirements.txt</code> file in the <code>setup</code> folder of the source code repository of this book. Once the image is there, you are ready to roll. Downloading it may take time, depending on your connection speed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Run the environment</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Run the image using the following command:<pre>docker run -p 8888:8888 -v 'pwd':/notebooks -it rcshubhadeep/packt-data-wrangling-base</pre><p>This will give you a ready-to-use environment. <a id="_idTextAnchor013"/></p></li>
				<li>Open a browser tab in Chrome or Firefox and go to <a href="http://localhost:8888"><code>http://localhost:8888</code></a>. You will be prompted to enter a token. The token is <code>dw_4_all</code>. </li>
				<li>Before you run the image, create a new folder and navigate there from the shell using the <code>cd</code> command.<p>Once you create a notebook  and save it as <code>ipynb</code> file. You can use <em class="italics">Ctrl +C</em> to stop running the image.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Introduction to Jupyter notebook</strong></p>
			<p>Project Jupyter is open source, free software that gives you the ability to run code, written in Python and some other languages, interactively from a special notebook, similar to a browser interface. It was born in 2014 from the <code>IPython</code> project and has since become the default choice for the entire data science workforce.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Once you are running the Jupyter server, click on <strong class="bold">New</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">Python 3</strong>. A new browser tab will open with a new and empty notebook. <a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Rename the Jupyter file:<div><img src="img/0.1.jpg" alt="" width="1050" height="337"/></div><h6>Figure 0.1: Jupyter server interface</h6><p>The main building blocks of Jupyter notebooks are cells. There are two types of cells: <strong class="bold">In</strong> (short for input) and <strong class="bold">Out</strong> (short for output). You can write code, normal text, and Markdown in <strong class="bold">In</strong> cells, press <em class="italics">Shift </em>+ <em class="italics">Enter</em> (or <em class="italics">Shift</em> + <em class="italics">Return</em>), and the code written in that particular <strong class="bold">In</strong> cell will be executed. The result will be shown in an <strong class="bold">Out</strong> cell, and you will land in a new <strong class="bold">In</strong> cell, ready for the next block of code. Once you get used to this interface, you will slowly discover the power and flexibility it offers.</p></li>
				<li>One final thing you should know about Jupyter cells is that when you start a new cell, by default, it is assumed that you will write code in it. However, if you want to write text, then you have to change the type. You can do that using the following sequence of keys: <em class="italics">Escape</em>-&gt;<em class="italics">m</em>-&gt;<em class="italics">Enter</em>:<div><img src="img/0.2.jpg" alt="" width="1737" height="762"/></div><h6>Figure 0.2: Jupyter notebook</h6></li>
				<li>And when you are done with writing the text, execute it using <em class="italics">Shift</em> + <em class="italics">Enter</em>. Unlike the code cells, the result of the compiled Markdown will be shown in the same place as the "<strong class="bold">In</strong>" cell.<h4>Note</h4><p class="callout">To have a "Cheat sheet" of all the handy key shortcuts in Jupyter, you can bookmark this Gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kidpixo/f4318f8c8143adee5b40">https://gist.github.com/kidpixo/f4318f8c8143adee5b40</a>. With this basic introduction and the image ready to be used, we are ready to embark on the exciting and enlightening journey that awaits us! </p></li>
