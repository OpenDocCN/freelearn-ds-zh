- en: 'Data has become increasingly important almost everywhere. It''s been said that
    *software is eating the world*, but that seems even truer of data. Sometimes,
    it seems that the focus has shifted: companies no long seem to want more users
    in order to show them advertisements. Now they want more users to gather data
    on them. Having more data is seen as a tremendous business advantage.'

- en: However, data by itself isn't really useful. It has to be analyzed, interrogated,
    and interpreted. Data scientists are settling on a number of great tools to do
    this, from R and Python to Hadoop and the web browser.

- en: This book looks at 10 data analysis tasks. Unlike *Clojure Data Analysis Cookbook*,
    *Packt Publishing*, this book examines fewer problems and tries to go into more
    depth. It's more of a case study approach.

- en: Why use Clojure? Clojure was first released in 2007 by Rich Hickey. It's a member
    of the lisp family of languages, and it has the strengths and flexibility that
    they provide. It's also functional, so Clojure programs are easy for reasoning.
    Also, it has amazing features to work concurrently and in parallel. All of these
    can help us as we analyze data, while keeping things simple and fast.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, Clojure runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so any libraries written
    for Java are available as well. Throughout this book, we'll see many examples
    of leveraging Java libraries for machine learning and other tasks. This gives
    Clojure an incredible amount of breadth and power.

    manner and also make the process more fun and enjoyable.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Network Analysis – The Six Degrees of Kevin
    Bacon"), *Network Analysis – The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon*, will discuss how
    people are socially organized into networks. These networks are reified in interesting
    ways in online social networks. We''ll take the opportunity to get a small dataset
    from an online social network and analyze and look at how people are related in
    it.'

    *GIS Analysis – Mapping Climate Change*, will explore how we can work with geographical
    data. It also walks us through getting the weather data and tying it to a geographical
    location. It then involves analyzing nearby points together to generate a graphic
    of a simplified and somewhat naive notion of how climate has changed over the
    period the weather has been tracked.'

    State of the Union Addresses"), *Topic Modeling – Changing Concerns in the State
    of the Union Addresses*, will address how we can scrape free text information
    off the Internet. It then uses topic modeling to look at the problems that presidents
    have faced and the themes that they''ve addressed over the years.'

    UFO Sightings*, will take a look at UFO sightings and talk about different ways
    to explore and get a grasp of what''s in the dataset. It will then classify the
    UFO sightings based on various attributes related to the sightings as well as
    their descriptions.'

    of Numbers"), *Benford''s Law – Detecting Natural Progressions of Numbers*, will
    take a look at the world population data from the World Bank data site. It will
    discuss **Benford''s Law** and how it can be used to determine whether a set of
    numbers is naturally generated or artificially or randomly constructed.'

    *Sentiment Analysis – Categorizing Hotel Reviews*, will take a look at the problems
    and possibilities related to sentiment analysis tasks. These are typically difficult
    and fraught categorizations of documents based on a notion of positive or negative.
    In this chapter, we''ll also take a look at categorizing, both manually and automatically,
    a dataset of hotel reviews.'

    [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
    JDK is necessary to run and develop on the Java platform.

    can download and install from [https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).
    Leiningen 2 is a tool that is used to manage Clojure projects and their dependencies.
    It's quickly becoming the de facto standard project tool in the Clojure community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    including Clojure itself. Leiningen will take care of downloading these for us
    as and when we need them.

    If you already have a text editor that you like, you can probably use it. Refer
    to [http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started)
    for tips and plugins to use your particular favorite environment. If you don't
    have a preference, I'd suggest that you look at using **Eclipse** with **Counterclockwise**.
    There are instructions to get this setup at [http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise).

    to use it in your data analysis processes, this book is for you. This isn't a
    tutorial on Clojure—there are already a number of excellent introductory books
    out there—so you'll need to be familiar with the language; however, you don't
    need to be an expert at it.

    probably be familiar with its tasks, processes, and techniques. While you might
    be able to gain enough from these case studies to get started, you'll want to
    get a more thorough introduction to this field to be truly effective.
