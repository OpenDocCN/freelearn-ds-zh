<p>The geospatial technology ecosystem consists of hundreds of software libraries and packages. This vast array of choices can be overwhelming for newcomers to geospatial analysis. The secret to learning geospatial analysis quickly is understanding the handful of libraries and packages that really matter. Most software, both commercial and open source, is derived from these critical packages. Understanding the ecosystem of geospatial software and how it's used allows you to quickly comprehend and evaluate any geospatial tool.</p>
<p>Geospatial libraries can be assigned to one or more of the following high-level core capabilities, which they implement to some degree. We will be learning about these capabilities in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data access</li>
<li>Computational geometry (including data reprojection)</li>
<li>Image processing</li>
<li>Visualization tools</li>
<li>Metadata tools</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we'll examine the packages that have had the largest impact on geospatial analysis, and also those that you are likely to frequently encounter. However, as with any filtering of information, you are encouraged to do your own research and draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>The following websites offer more information on software that is not included in this chapter:</p>

<li>OSGeo project list and incubator projects: <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">http://www.osgeo.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The image processing software capability is for remote sensing. However, this category of software is very fragmented, containing dozens of software packages that are rarely integrated into derivative software. Most image processing software for remote sensing is based on the same data access libraries, with custom image processing algorithms implemented on top of them.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following examples of these types of software, which include both open source and commercial packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Source Software Image Map</strong> (<strong>OSSIM</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Resources Analysis Support System</strong> (<strong>GRASS</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Orfeo ToolBox</strong> (<strong>OTB</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>ERDAS IMAGINE</strong></li>
<li><strong>ENVI</strong></li>
</ul>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Understanding data access</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As described in <a href="a7a60707-fb99-41d3-959c-7ed43a469c55.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Learning Geospatial Data</em>, geospatial datasets are typically large, complex, and varied. This challenge makes libraries that efficiently read, and in some cases write, this data essential to geospatial analysis. Without access to data, geospatial analysis cannot begin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, accuracy and precision are key factors in geospatial analysis. An image library that resamples data without permission, or a computational geometry library that rounds a coordinate by even a couple of decimal places, can adversely affect the quality of the analysis. Also, these libraries must manage memory efficiently. A complex geospatial process can last for hours, or even days.</p>
<p>If a data access library has a memory fault, it can delay an entire project or even an entire workflow, involving dozens of people who are dependent on the output of that analysis.</p>
<p>Data access libraries such as <strong>Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</strong> (<strong>GDAL</strong>) are mostly written in either C or C++ for speed and cross-platform compatibility. Speed is important due to the typically large size of geospatial datasets. However, you will also see many packages written in Java. When it's well written, pure Java can approach speeds that are acceptable for processing large vector or raster datasets, and that are usually acceptable for most applications.</p>
<p>The following concept map shows the major geospatial software libraries and packages and how they are related. The libraries in bold represent root libraries that are actively maintained, and are not significantly derived from any other libraries. These root libraries represent geospatial operations, which are rather difficult to implement, and the vast majority of people choose to use one of these libraries, rather than create a competing one. As you can see, a handful of libraries make up a disproportionate amount of geospatial analysis software. The following diagram is by no means exhaustive. In this book, we'll discuss only the most commonly used packages:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/732915c1-777c-4166-a710-78abe8c7b151.png" style="width:33.17em;height:31.42em;" width="2042" height="1923"/></p>
<p>The <strong>GDAL</strong>, <strong>GEOS</strong> (short for <strong>Geometry Engine - Open Source</strong>), and <strong>PROJ </strong>libraries are the heart and soul of the geospatial analysis community on both the commercial and open source sides. It is important to note that these libraries are all written in C or C++. There is also significant work done in Java in the form of the <strong>GeoTools</strong> and <strong>Java Topology Suite</strong> (<strong>JTS</strong>) core libraries, which are used across a range of desktops, servers, and mobile software. Given that there are hundreds of geospatial packages available, with nearly all of them relying on these libraries to do anything meaningful, you'll beginning to get an idea of the complexity of geospatial data access and computational geometry. Compare this software domain to that of text editors, which return over 5,000 options when searched on the open source project site (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</a>).</p>
<p>Geospatial analysis is a truly worldwide community, with significant contributions to the field coming from every corner of the globe. But as you learn more about the heavy-hitting packages at the center of the software landscape, you'll see that these programs tend to come from Canada or are contributed to heavily by Canadian developers.</p>
<p>Credited as the birthplace of modern GIS, geospatial analysis is a matter of national pride. Also, the Canadian government and the public–private GeoConnections program have invested heavily in research and companies, both to fuel the industry for economic reasons, and out of necessity – to better manage the country's vast natural resources and the needs of its population.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">GDAL</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>GDAL does the most heavy-lifting tasks in the geospatial industry. The GDAL website lists over 80 pieces of software using the library, and this list is by no means complete. Many of these packages are industry leading, open source, and commercial tools. This list doesn't include the hundreds of smaller projects and individual analysts who are using the library for geospatial analysis. GDAL also includes a set of command-line tools that can do a variety of operations without any programming.</p>
<p>A list of projects using GDAL can be found at the following URL: <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SoftwareUsingGdal">http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SoftwareUsingGdal</a>.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">GDAL and raster data</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>GDAL provides a single, abstract data model for the vast array of raster data types that are found in the geospatial industry. It consolidates unique data access libraries for different formats, and provides a common API for reading and writing data. Before the developer Frank Warmerdam created GDAL in the late 1990s, each data format required a separate data access library with a different API in order to read data, or in the worst-case scenario, developers often wrote custom data access routines.</p>
<p>The following diagram provides a visual description of how GDAL abstracts raster data:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/bbd8335b-f5e3-4a5e-9245-1c9135949f53.png" style="width:31.58em;height:26.58em;" width="1257" height="1059"/></p>
<p>In the preceding software concept map, you can see that GDAL has had the greatest impact of any single piece of geospatial software. Combine GDAL with its sister library, OGR, for vector data, and the impact almost doubles. The PROJ library has also had a tremendous impact, but it is usually accessed via OGR or GDAL.</p>
<p>The GDAL home page can be found at <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">http://www.gdal.org/</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">GDAL and vector data</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In addition to raster data, GDAL lists at least partial support for over 70 vector data formats. Part of the success of the GDAL package is the X11/MIT open source license. This license is both commercial and open source-friendly. The GDAL library can be included in proprietary software without revealing the proprietary source code to users.</p>
<p>GDAL has the following vector capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform vector data and modeling abstraction</li>
<li>Vector data reprojection</li>
<li>Vector data format conversion</li>
<li>Attribute data filtering</li>
<li>Basic geometry filtering including clipping and point-in-polygon testing</li>
</ul>
<p>GDAL has several command-line utility programs, which demonstrate its capability for vector data. This capability can also be accessed through its programming API. The following diagram outlines the GDAL vector architecture:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e0718ca3-d3bf-4626-8831-59ea78c7d5c3.png" style="width:28.50em;height:17.33em;" width="1501" height="914"/></p>
<p>The GDAL vector architecture is fairly concise, considering this model is able to represent over 70 different data formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geometry</strong>: This object represents the <strong>Open Geospatial Consortium</strong> (<strong>OGC</strong>) Simple Features specification data model for points, linestrings, polygons, geometry collections, multipolygons, multipoints, and multilinestrings.</li>
<li><strong>Feature Definition</strong>: This object contains the attribute definitions of a group of related features.</li>
<li><strong>Feature:</strong> This object ties the <strong>Geometry</strong> and <strong>Feature Definition</strong> information together.</li>
<li><strong>Spatial Reference</strong>: This object contains an OGC spatial reference definition.</li>
<li><strong>Layer</strong>: This object represents features that are grouped as layers within a data source.</li>
<li><strong>Data Source</strong>: This object is the file or database object that is accessed by GDAL.</li>
<li><strong>Drivers</strong>: This object contains the translators for the 70-plus data formats that are available to GDAL.</li>
</ul>
<p>This architecture works smoothly, with one minor quirk – the layer concept is used even for data formats that only contain a single layer. For example, shapefiles can only represent a single layer. But, when you access a shapefile using GDAL, you must still invoke a new layer object using the base name of the shapefile without a file extension. This design feature is only a minor inconvenience, heavily outweighed by the power that GDAL provides.</p>
<p>Now, let's go beyond accessing the data, to using it for analysis.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Understanding computational geometry</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Computational geometry encompasses the algorithms that are needed to perform operations on vector data. The field is very old in computer science; however, most of the libraries used for geospatial operations are separate from computer graphics libraries because of geospatial coordinate systems. As described near the end of <a href="6b5bd08a-170c-4471-a3f3-d79d5b91f017.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Learning about Geospatial Analysis with Python</em>, computer screen coordinates are almost always expressed in positive numbers, while geospatial coordinate systems often use negative numbers when they're moving west and south.</p>
<p>Several different geospatial libraries fit into this category, but they also serve a wide range of uses, from spatial selection to rendering. It should be noted that some features of GDAL that were described previously move it beyond the category of data access, and into the realm of computational geometry. But, it was included in the former category because that is its primary purpose.</p>
<p>Computational geometry is a fascinating subject. When writing a simple script to automate a geospatial operation, you inevitably need a spatial algorithm. The question then arises, <em>do you try to implement this algorithm yourself, or do you go through the overhead of using a third-party library?</em> The choice is always deceptive because some tasks are visually easy to understand and implement, some look complex but turn out to be easy, and some are trivial to comprehend but are extraordinarily difficult to implement. One such example is a geospatial buffer operation.</p>
<p>The concept is easy enough, but the algorithm turns out to be quite difficult. The following libraries in this section are the major packages that are used for computational geometry algorithms.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">The PROJ projection library</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>U.S. Geological Survey</strong> (<strong>USGS</strong>) analyst, Jerry Evenden, created what is now known as the PROJ projection library in the mid-1990s while working at the USGS. Since then, it has become a project of the <strong>Open Source Geospatial Foundation</strong> (<strong>OSGeo</strong>), with contributions from many other developers. PROJ accomplishes the Herculean task of transforming data among thousands of coordinate systems. The math that is needed to convert points among so many coordinate systems is extremely complex. No other library comes close to the capability of PROJ. That fact and the routine that is needed by applications to convert datasets from different sources to a common projection make PROJ the undisputed leader in this area.</p>
<p>The following plot is an example of how specific the projections that are supported by PROJ can be. This plot from <a href="https://calcofi.org">https://calcofi.org</a> represents the line/station coordinate system of the <strong>California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations</strong> (<strong>CalCOFI</strong>) program pseudo-projection, which is used only by <strong>NOAA</strong> (short for <strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</strong>), the University of California Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to collect oceanographic and fisheries data over the last 60 years along the California coastline:</p>
<div><img src="img/c5856ea3-2e51-4916-8cbd-e1bce1ad7a6f.png" style="width:24.58em;height:28.75em;" width="697" height="816"/></div>
<p>PROJ uses a simple syntax that is capable of describing any projection, including custom, localized ones, as shown in the previous plot. PROJ can be found in virtually every major GIS package, providing reprojection support, and it also has its own command-line tools.</p>
<p>It is available through GDAL for vector and raster data. However, it is often useful to access the library directly, because it gives you the ability to reproject individual points. Most of the libraries that incorporate PROJ only let you reproject entire datasets.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">CGAL</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <strong>Computational Geometry Algorithms Library</strong> (<strong>CGAL</strong>), originally released in the late 1990s, is a robust and well-established open source computational geometry library. It was not specifically designed for geospatial analysis but is commonly used in the field.</p>
<p>CGAL is often referenced as a source for reliable geometry processing algorithms. The following diagram from the <em>CGAL User and Reference Manual</em> provides a visualization of one of the often-referenced algorithms from CGAL, called a polygon straight skeleton, which is needed to accurately grow or shrink a polygon:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/1703453d-1c4f-4b74-a786-27ff548cd2ce.png" style="width:34.50em;height:15.42em;" width="890" height="397"/></p>
<p>The straight skeleton algorithm is complex and important because shrinking or growing a polygon isn't just a matter of making it bigger or smaller. The polygon actually changes shape. As a polygon shrinks, non-adjacent edges collide and eliminate connecting edges. As a polygon grows, adjacent edges separate and new edges are formed to connect them. This process is key to the buffering of geospatial polygons. The following diagram, also from the <em>CGAL User and Reference Manual</em>, shows this effect using insets on the preceding polygon:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3cfe230d-944e-4d67-a023-851e09e0642e.png" style="width:35.75em;height:13.00em;" width="827" height="302"/></p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">JTS</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>JTS is a geospatial computational geometry library that is written in 100% pure Java. JTS separates itself from other computational geometry libraries by implementing the OGC Simple Features specification for SQL. Interestingly, other developers have ported JTS to other languages, including C++, Microsoft .NET, and even JavaScript.</p>
<p>JTS includes a fantastic test program called the JTS TestBuilder, which provides a GUI to test functions without setting up an entire program. One of the most frustrating aspects of geospatial analysis concerns bizarre geometry shapes that break algorithms that work most of the time. Another common issue is unexpected results due to tiny errors in data such as polygons that intersect themselves in very small areas that are not easily visible. The JTS TestBuilder lets you interactively test JTS algorithms to verify data, or just to visually understand a process, as shown here:</p>
<div><img src="img/bdb100a4-6cb3-421b-bcb8-53ab68137e22.png" style="width:39.67em;height:37.33em;" width="768" height="723"/></div>
<p>This tool is handy even if you aren't using JTS, but one of the several ports to another language. It should be noted that Vivid Solutions, the maintainer of JTS, hasn't released a new version since JTS Version 1.8 in December 2006. The package is quite stable and still in active use.</p>

<p>GEOS<strong> </strong>is the C++ port of the JTS library that was explained previously. It is mentioned here because this port has had a much larger impact on geospatial analysis than the original JTS. The C++ version can be compiled on many platforms, as it avoids any platform-specific dependencies. Another factor responsible for the popularity of GEOS is that a fair amount of infrastructure exists to create automated or semi-automated bindings to various scripting languages, including Python. Another factor is that the majority of geospatial analysis software is written in C or C++. The most common use of GEOS is through other APIs that include GEOS as a library.</p>
<p>GEOS provides the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>OGC Simple Features</li>
<li>Geospatial predicate functions</li>
<li>Intersects</li>
<li>Touches</li>
<li>Disjoint</li>

<div><h1 class="header-title">PostGIS</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As far as open source geospatial databases go, PostGIS is the most commonly used spatial database. PostGIS is essentially a module on top of the well-known PostgreSQL relational database. Much of the power of PostGIS comes from the previously mentioned GEOS library. Like JTS, it also implements the OGC Simple Features specification for SQL. This combination of computational geometry ability in a geospatial context sets PostGIS in a category of its own.</p>
<p>PostGIS allows you to execute both attribute and spatial queries against a dataset. Recall the point from <a href="a7a60707-fb99-41d3-959c-7ed43a469c55.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Learning</em> <em>Geospatial Data</em>, that a typical spatial dataset is comprised of multiple data types including geometry, attributes (one or more columns of data in a row), and in most cases, indexing data. In PostGIS, you can query attribute data as you would do to any database table using SQL.</p>
<p>This capability is not surprising, as attribute data is stored in a traditional database structure. However, you can also query geometry using SQL syntax. Spatial operations are available through SQL functions, which you include as part of your queries. The following sample PostGIS SQL statement creates a 14.5 km buffer around the state of <kbd>Florida</kbd>:</p>
<pre>SELECT ST_Buffer(the_geom, 14500) 
FROM usa_states 
WHERE state = 'Florida' </pre>
<p>The <kbd>FROM</kbd> clause designates the <kbd>usa_states</kbd> layer as the location of the query. We filter that layer by isolating <kbd>Florida</kbd> in the <kbd>WHERE</kbd> clause. <kbd>Florida</kbd> is a value in the <kbd>state</kbd> column of the <kbd>usa_states</kbd> layer. The <kbd>SELECT</kbd> clause performs the actual spatial selection on the geometry of <kbd>Florida</kbd> that is normally contained in the <kbd>the_geom</kbd> column using the PostGIS <kbd>ST_Buffer()</kbd> function. The <kbd>the_geom</kbd> column is the geometry column for the PostGIS layer in this instance. The <kbd>ST</kbd> abbreviation in the function name stands for <strong>spatial type</strong>. The <kbd>ST_Buffer()</kbd> function accepts a column containing spatial geometries and a distance in the map units of the underlying layer.</p>
<p>The map units in the <kbd>usa_states</kbd> layer are expressed in meters, so 14.5 km would be 14,500 meters in the preceding example. Recall the point from <a href="6b5bd08a-170c-4471-a3f3-d79d5b91f017.xhtml">Chapter</a> <a href="6b5bd08a-170c-4471-a3f3-d79d5b91f017.xhtml">1</a>, <em>Learning about Geospatial Analysis with Python,</em> that buffers like this query are used for proximity analysis. It just so happens that the Florida state water boundary expands 9 nautical miles, or approximately 14.5 km into the Gulf of Mexico from the state's western and northwestern coastlines.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following map shows the official Florida state water boundary as a dotted line, which is labeled on the map:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d0606e1a-c005-4d34-afd6-89bf9a76eccf.png" width="1683" height="1446"/></p>
<p>After applying the 9-nautical-mile buffer, you can see on the following map that the result, highlighted in orange, is quite close to the official legal boundary, which is based on detailed ground surveys:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ffd2e2de-a6d1-4932-8432-4e235000faf5.png" style="width:36.83em;height:24.42em;" width="1296" height="859"/></p>
<p>Currently, PostGIS maintains the following feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geospatial geometry types, including points, linestrings, polygons, multipoints, multilinestrings, multipolygons, and geometry collections, which can store different types of geometries, including other collections of spatial functions for testing geometric relationships (for example, point-in-polygon or unions)</li>
<li>Spatial functions for deriving new geometries (for example, buffers and intersects)</li>
<li>Spatial measurements including perimeter, length, and area</li>
<li>Spatial indexing using the R-tree algorithm</li>
<li>A basic geospatial raster data type</li>
<li>Topology data types</li>
<li>U.S. geocoder based on <strong>TIGER</strong> (short for <strong>Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing</strong>) census data</li>
<li>A new JSONB data type, which allows indexing and the querying of JSON and GeoJSON</li>
</ul>
<p>The PostGIS feature set is competitive among all geodatabases, and is the most extensive among any open source or free geodatabases. The active momentum of the PostGIS development community is another reason for this system being best-of-breed.

<p>PostGIS is the gold standard among free and open source geospatial databases. However, there are several other systems that you should be aware of as a geospatial analyst. This list includes both commercial and open source systems, each with varying degrees of geospatial support.</p>
<p>Geodatabases have evolved in parallel with geospatial software, standards, and the web. The internet has driven the need for large, multiuser geospatial database servers that are able to serve large amounts of data. The following diagram, courtesy of <a href="https://www.osgeo.org/">www.OSGeo.org</a>, shows how geospatial architectures have evolved, with a significant portion of this evolution happening at the database level:</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Oracle Spatial and Graph</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Oracle relational database is a widely used database system that is typically used by very large organizations because of its cost and large scalability. It is also extremely stable and fast. It runs some of the largest and most complicated databases in the world and is often found in hospitals, banks, and government agencies that manage millions of critical records.</p>
<p>Geospatial data capability first appeared in Oracle version 4 as a modification by the <strong>Canadian Hydrographic Service</strong> (<strong>CHS</strong>). CHS also implemented Oracle's first spatial index, in the form of an unusual, but efficient, three-dimensional helical spiral. Oracle subsequently incorporated the modification and released the Oracle <strong>Spatial Database Option</strong> (<strong>SDO</strong>) in version 7 of the main database. The SDO system became Oracle Spatial in Oracle version 8. The database schema of Oracle Spatial still has the SDO prefix on some column and table names, similar to how PostGIS uses the OGC convention, ST, to separate spatial information from traditional relational database tables and functions at the schema level.</p>
<p>As of 2012, Oracle began calling the package Oracle Spatial and Graph, in order to emphasize the network data module. This module is used for analyzing networked datasets, such as transportation or utilities. However, the module can also be used against abstract networks, such as social networks. The analysis of social network data is a common target for big data analysis, which is now a growing trend. Big data social network analysis is likely the reason Oracle changed the name of the product.</p>
<p>Oracle Spatial has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A geospatial data schema</li>
<li>A spatial indexing system, which is now based on an R-tree index</li>
<li>An SQL API for performing geometric operations</li>
<li>A spatial data-tuning API to optimize a particular dataset</li>
<li>A topology data model</li>
<li>A network data model</li>
<li>A GeoRaster data type to store, index, query, and retrieve raster data</li>
<li>Three-dimensional data types, including <strong>triangulated irregular networks</strong> (<strong>TINs</strong>) and <strong>LIDAR</strong> (short for <strong>Light Detection and Ranging</strong>) point clouds</li>
<li>A geocoder to search location names and return coordinates</li>
<li>A routing engine for driving direction-type queries</li>
<li>OGC compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracle Spatial and PostGIS are reasonably comparable and are both commonly used. You will see these two systems sooner or later as data sources while performing geospatial analysis.</p>
<p>Oracle Spatial and Graph is sold separately from Oracle itself. A little-known fact is that the SDO data type is native to the main Oracle database. If you have a simple application that just inputs points and retrieves them, you can use the main Oracle API to add, update, and retrieve SDOs without Oracle Spatial and Graph.</p>
<p>The U.S. <strong>Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management, Regulation, and Enforcement</strong> (<strong>BOEMRE</strong>) uses Oracle to manage environmental, business, and geospatial data for billions of dollars worth of oil, gas, and mineral rights, in one of the largest geospatial systems in the world. The following map is courtesy of BOEMRE:</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">ArcSDE</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>ArcSDE is Esri's <strong>spatial data engine</strong> (<strong>SDE</strong>). It is now rolled into Esri's ArcGIS Server product after over a decade of being a standalone product. What makes ArcSDE interesting is that the engine is mostly database-independent, supporting multiple database backends. ArcSDE supports IBM DB2, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL as data storage systems. While ArcSDE has the ability to create and manage a spatial schema from scratch on systems such as Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle, it uses native spatial engines if they are available. This arrangement is the case for IBM DB2, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. For Oracle, ArcSDE manages the table structure but can rely on the Oracle SDO data type for feature storage.</p>
<p>Like the previously mentioned geodatabases, ArcSDE also has a rich spatial selection API, and can handle raster data. However, ArcSDE does not have as rich a SQL spatial API as Oracle and PostGIS. Esri technically supports basic SQL functionality related to ArcSDE, but it encourages users and developers to use Esri software or programming APIs in order to manipulate data that is stored through ArcSDE, as it is designed to be a data source for Esri software.</p>
<p>Esri does provide software libraries to allow developers to build applications outside of Esri software using ArcSDE or Esri's file-based geodatabase, known as a personal geodatabase. But, these libraries are black boxes and the communication protocol that ArcSDE uses has never been reverse engineered. Typically, interaction happens between ArcSDE and third-party applications at the web services level using the ArcGIS Server API (which supports OGC services to some degree), and a fairly straightforward REST API service that returns GeoJSON.</p>
<p>The following screenshot is taken from the U.S. federal site, <a href="http://catalog.data.gov">http://catalog.data.gov</a>, a very large geospatial data catalog that is based on ArcSDE, which in turn networks U.S. federal data, including other ArcSDE installations from other federal agencies.</p>
<p>ArcSDE is integrated into ArcGIS Server; however, information on it can be found at <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcsde">http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcsde</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft added spatial data support to its flagship database product in Microsoft SQL Server 2008. It has gradually improved since that version but still is nowhere near as sophisticated as Oracle Spatial or PostGIS. Microsoft supports the same data types as PostGIS, but uses slightly different naming conventions, with the exception of rasters, which are not directly supported. It also supports output to WKT and WKB formats.</p>
<p>It offers some very basic support for spatial selection, but it is obviously not a priority for Microsoft at the moment. This limited support is likely because it is all that can be used for Microsoft software mapping components, and several third-party engines can provide spatial support on top of SQL Server.</p>
<p>Microsoft's support for spatial data in SQL Server is documented at the following link: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb933790.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb933790.aspx</a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb933790.aspx">.</a></p>

<p>MySQL, another highly popular free database, provides nearly the same support as Microsoft SQL Server. The OGC geometry types are supported by basic spatial relationship functions. Through a series of buyouts, MySQL has become the property of Oracle.</p>
<p>While Oracle currently remains committed to MySQL as an open source database, this purchase has brought the ultimate future of the world's most popular open source database into question. But, as far as geospatial analysis is concerned, MySQL is barely a contender and is unlikely to be the first choice for any project.</p>

<p>SpatiaLite is an extension of the open source SQLite database engine. SQLite uses a file database and is designed to be integrated into applications rather than into the typical client-server model, which is used by most relational database servers. SQLite already has spatial data types and spatial indexing, but SpatiaLite adds support for the OGC Simple Features specification, as well as map projections. </p>
<p>It should be noted that the extremely popular SQLite is not in the same category as Oracle, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, as it's a file-based database that is designed for single-user applications.</p>

<p>GeoPackage is a file-based geodatabase format. The official GeoPackage website, <a href="http://geopackage.org">http://geopackage.org</a>, describes it as:</p>
<p>"An open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information."</p>
<p>It is also a direct answer to Esri's file geodatabase format, and also to the open geospatial community's designated <em>shapefile killer</em>, to replace the aging, partially closed shapefile format. Both formats are really file specifications, which rely on other software in order to read and write data.</p>
<p>GeoPackage is an OGC specification, which means its future is secure as an industry data format. It is also a <em>catch-all</em> format, which can handle vector data, raster data, attribute information, and extensions to address new requirements. And, like any good database, it handles multiple layers. You can store an entire GIS project in a single package, therefore making data management much simpler.</p>

<p>Routing is a very niche area of computational geometry. It is also a very rich field of study that goes far beyond the familiar driving directions use case. The requirements for a routing algorithm are simply a networked dataset and impedance values that affect the speed of travel on that network. Typically, the dataset is vector-based, but raster data can also be used for certain applications.</p>
<p>The two major contenders in this area are Esri's Network Analyst, and the open source pgRouting engine for PostGIS. The most common routing problem is the most efficient way to visit a number of point locations. This problem is called the <strong>traveling salesman problem</strong><em> </em>(<strong>TSP</strong>). The TSP is one of the most intensely studied problems in computational geometry. It is often considered the benchmark for any routing algorithm.</p>
<p>More information on the TSP can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem</a>.</p>

<p>Esri's entry into the routing arena, Network Analyst, is a truly generic routing engine that can tackle most routing applications regardless of context. Spatial Analyst is another Esri extension that is raster-focused, and it can perform <em>least-cost path</em> analysis on raster terrain data.</p>

<p>The <strong>pgRouting</strong> extension for PostGIS adds routing functionality to the geodatabase. It is oriented toward road networks, but it can be adapted to work with other types of networked data.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a driving distance radius calculation output by pgRouting, which is displayed in QGIS. The points are color-coded from green to red, based on their proximity to the starting location. As shown in the following diagram, the points are nodes in the network dataset, courtesy of QGIS.org (<a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">https://qgis.org/en/site/</a>), which in this case are roads:</p>

<p>Geospatial analysis requires the ability to visualize output. This fact makes tools that can visualize data absolutely critical to the field. There are two categories of geospatial visualization tools.</p>
<p>The first is geospatial viewers and the second is geospatial analysis software. The first category – geospatial viewers—allows you to access, query, and visualize data, but not to edit it in any way. The second category allows you to perform those tasks, and edit the data, too. The main advantage of viewers is that they are typically lightweight pieces of software that launch and load data quickly.</p>
<p>Geospatial analysis software requires far more resources to be able to edit complex geospatial data, so it loads more slowly and often renders data more slowly, in order to provide dynamic editing functionality.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Quantum GIS</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Quantum GIS</strong>, more commonly known as <strong>QGIS</strong>, is a complete open source geographic information system. QGIS falls well within the geospatial analysis category in the two categories of visualization software. The development of the system began in 2002 and Version 1.0 was released in 2009.</p>
<p>It is the best showcase of most of the libraries that have been previously mentioned in this chapter. QGIS is written in C++, using the Qt library for the GUI. The GUI is well designed and easy to use. In fact, a geospatial analyst who has been trained on a proprietary package, such as Esri's ArcGIS or Manifold system, will be right at home using QGIS. The tools and menu system are logical and typical of a GIS system. The overall speed of QGIS is as good as, or better than, any other system that is available.</p>
<p>A nice feature of QGIS is that the underlying libraries and utility programs are just underneath the surface. Modules can be written by any third party in Python and added to the system. QGIS also has a robust online package management system to search for, install, and update these extensions. The Python integration includes a console that allows you to issue commands at the console and see the results in the GUI. QGIS isn't the only software to offer this capability.</p>
<p>Like most geospatial software packages, with Python integration, it installs a complete version of Python if you use the automated installer. There's no reason to worry if you already have Python installed. Having multiple versions of Python on a single machine is fairly common and well supported. Many people have multiple versions of Python on their computers for the purpose of testing software, or because it is such a common scripting environment for so many different software packages.</p>
<p>When the Python console is running in QGIS, the entire program API is available through an automatically loaded object called <kbd>qgis.utils.iface</kbd>. The following screenshot shows QGIS with the Python console running:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/75c8ecab-baff-4e47-a50b-69a86a14ff11.png" width="2529" height="1800"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Because QIS is based on GDAL/OGR and GEOS, and it can use PostGIS, it supports all of the data sources that are offered by those packages. It also has nice raster processing features, too. QGIS works well for producing paper maps or entire map books using available extensions.</p>
<p>QGIS is well documented on the QGIS website at the following link: <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html">http://www.qgis.org/en/documentation.html</a>. You can also find numerous online and video tutorials by searching for QGIS or particular operation.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">OpenEV</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>OpenEV is an open source geospatial viewer that was originally developed by Atlantis Scientific around 2002, which became Vexcel, before a buyout by Microsoft. Vexcel developed OpenEV as a freely downloadable satellite image viewer for the <strong>Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure</strong> (<strong>CGDI</strong>). It is built using GDAL and Python and is partially maintained by GDAL creator, Frank Warmerdam.</p>
<p>OpenEV is one of the fastest raster viewers available. Despite being originally designed as a viewer, OpenEV offers all of the utility of GDAL and PROJ. While created as a raster tool, it can overlay vector data such as shapefiles, and even supports basic editing. Raster images can also be altered using the built-in raster calculator, and data formats can be converted, reprojected, and clipped.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows a 25 MB, 16-bit integer GeoTIFF elevation file in an OpenEV viewer window:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/1ec79a28-a5df-498c-b8d3-a2c97cf0e049.png" width="1024" height="737"/></p>
<p>OpenEV is built largely in Python and offers a Python console with access to the full capability of the program. The OpenEV GUI isn't as sophisticated as other tools, such as QGIS. For example, you cannot drag and drop geospatial datasets into the viewer as you can do in QGIS. But, the raw speed of OpenEV makes it very attractive for simple raster viewing, or for basic processing and data conversion.</p>

<p>GRASS is one of the oldest continuously developed geospatial systems in existence. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began GRASS development in 1982. It was originally designed to run on Unix systems. In 1995, the army released the last patch, and the software was transferred to community development, where it has remained ever since.</p>
<p>Even though the user interface was redesigned, GRASS still feels somewhat esoteric to modern GIS users. However, because of its decades-old legacy and non-existent price tag, many geospatial workflows and highly specialized modules have been implemented in GRASS over the years, making it highly relevant to many organizations and individuals, especially in research communities. For these reasons, GRASS is still actively developed.</p>
<p>GRASS has also been integrated with QGIS, so the more modern and familiar QGIS GUI can be used to run GRASS functions. GRASS is also deeply integrated with Python and can be used as a library or as a command-line tool. The following screenshot shows some landform analysis in the native GRASS GUI, which was built using the <kbd>wxPython</kbd> library:</p>

The result was gvSIG, which has continued to mature. The feature set is mostly comparable to QGIS, with some unique capabilities as well.</p>
<p>The official gvSIG project has a very active fork called <strong>gvSIG Community Edition</strong> (<strong>gvSIG CE</strong>). There is also a mobile version called gvSIG mobile. The gvSIG code base is open source.</p>

<p>OpenJUMP is another open source Java-based desktop GIS. <strong>JUMP</strong> stands for <strong>Java Unified Mapping Platform</strong>, and was originally created by Vivid Solutions for the Government of British Columbia. After Vivid Solutions delivered JUMP, development stopped. Vivid Solutions eventually released JUMP to the open source community, where it was renamed OpenJUMP.</p>
<p>OpenJUMP has the ability to read and write shapefiles and OGC <strong>GML</strong> (short for <strong>Geography Markup Language</strong>), and supports PostGIS databases. It can also display some image formats and data from OGC <strong>WMS</strong> (short for <strong>Web Map Server</strong>) and <strong>WFS</strong> (short for <strong>Web Feature Service</strong>) services. It has a plugin architecture, and it can also serve as a development platform for custom applications.</p>

<p>Google Earth is so ubiquitous that it hardly seems worth mentioning. The first release of EarthViewer 3D in 2001 (created by a company called Keyhole Inc.), and the EarthViewer 3D project were funded by the non-profit venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel, which in turn, is funded by the U.S. Central Intelligence agency. This spy agency lineage and the subsequent purchase of Keyhole by Google to create and distribute Google Earth brought global attention to the geospatial analysis field.</p>
<p>Since the first release of the software as Google Earth in 2005, Google has continually refined it. Some of the notable additions are the creation of Google Moon, Google Mars, Google Sky, and Google Oceans. These are virtual globe applications, which feature data from the Moon and Mars, with the exception of Google Oceans, which adds sea-floor elevation mapping, known as bathymetry, to Google Earth.</p>
<p>Google Earth introduced the idea of the spinning virtual globe concept for the exploration of geographic data. After centuries of looking at 2D maps, or low-resolution physical globes, flying around the Earth virtually and dropping onto a street corner anywhere in the world was mind-blowing – especially for geospatial analysts and other geography enthusiasts, as depicted in the following screenshot of Google Earth, overlooking the Central Business District in New Orleans, Louisiana:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/af235c29-bffb-4f2e-b879-677af51db81f.png" width="1024" height="738"/></p>
<p>Just as Google had revolutionized web mapping with its tile-based <em>slippy</em> mapping approach, the virtual globe concept was a major boost to geospatial visualization.</p>
<p>After the initial excitement wore off, many geospatial analysts realized that Google Earth was a very animated and fun geographic exploration tool, but it really had a very limited utility for any kind of meaningful geospatial analysis. Google Earth falls squarely into the realm of geospatial viewer software.</p>
<p>The only data format it consumes is its native <strong>keyhole markup language</strong> (<strong>KML</strong>), which is an all-in-one data and styling format, which is discussed in <a href="a7a60707-fb99-41d3-959c-7ed43a469c55.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Learning</em> <em>Geospatial Data</em>. As this format is now an OGC standard, consuming only one data format immediately limits the utility of any tool. Any project involving Google Earth must first begin with complete data conversion and styling in KML, reminiscent of geospatial analysis from around 10-20 years ago. The tools that do support KML, including Google Maps, support a limited subset of KML.</p>
<p>Google Earth's native dataset has global coverage, but it is a mixture of datasets spanning several years and sources. Google has greatly improved the inline metadata in the tool, which identifies the source and approximate date of the current view. But, this method creates confusion among lay people. Many people believe that the data in Google Earth is updated far more frequently than it really is. The Google Street View system, showing street-level, 360-degree views of much of the world, has somewhat helped to correct this misperception.</p>
<p>People are able to easily identify images of familiar locations as being several years old. Another common misperception created by Google Earth is that the entire world has been mapped in detail, and therefore creating a base map for geospatial analysis should be trivial. As discussed in <a href="a7a60707-fb99-41d3-959c-7ed43a469c55.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Learning</em> <em>Geospatial Data</em>, mapping an area of interest is far easier than it used to be a few years ago by using modern data and software, but it is still a complex and labor-intensive endeavor. This misperception is one of the first customer expectations a geospatial analyst must manage when starting a project.</p>
<p>Despite these misperceptions, the impact that Google has had on geospatial analysis is almost entirely positive. For decades, one of the most difficult challenges to growing the geospatial industry was convincing potential stakeholders that geospatial analysis is almost always the best approach when making decisions about people, resources, and the environment. This hurdle stands in sharp contrast to a car dealer. When a potential customer comes to a car lot, the salesman doesn't have to convince the buyer that they need a car, just about the type of car.</p>
<p>Geospatial analysts had to first educate project sponsors on the technology, and then convince them that the geospatial approach was the best way to address a challenge. Google has largely eliminated those steps for analysts.</p>

<p>NASA WorldWind is an open source virtual globe and geospatial viewer, originally released by the U.S. <strong>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</strong> (<strong>NASA</strong>), in 2004. It was originally based on Microsoft's .NET Framework, making it a Windows-centric application.</p>
<p>The following screenshot of NASA WorldWind looks similar to Google Earth:</p>

<p>In 2007, a Java-based <strong>software development kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong>) was released, called <strong>WorldWind Java</strong>, which made WorldWind more cross-platform. The transition to Java also led to the creation of a browser plugin for WorldWind.</p>
<p>The WorldWind Java SDK is considered an SDK and not a desktop application like the .NET version. However, the demos included with the SDK provide a viewer without any additional development. While NASA WorldWind was originally inspired by Google Earth, its status as an open source project takes it in an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>Google Earth is a generalist tool that is bounded by the limits of the KML specification. NASA WorldWind is now a platform upon which anyone can develop without limits. As new types of data become available and computing resources grow, the potential of the virtual globe paradigm certainly holds more potential for geospatial visualization that has not yet been explored.</p>
<p>NASA WorldWind is available online at <a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/">http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/</a>.</p>

<p>Esri walks the line of being one of the greatest promoters of the geospatial analytical approach to understanding our world, and is a privately held, profit-making business, which must look out for its own interests to a certain degree. The ArcGIS software suite represents every type of geospatial visualization known, including vector, raster, globes, and 3D. It is also a market leader in many countries. As shown in the geospatial software map earlier in this chapter, Esri has increasingly incorporated open source software into its suite of tools, including GDAL for raster display, and Python as the scripting language for ArcGIS.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Understanding metadata management</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The distribution of data on the internet has increased the importance of metadata. Data custodians are able to release a dataset to the entire world for download without any personal interaction. The metadata record of a geospatial dataset can follow this to help ensure that the integrity and accountability of this data are maintained.</p>
<p>Properly formatted metadata also allows for automated cataloging, search indexing, and the integration of datasets. Metadata has become so important that a common mantra within the geospatial community is <em>data without metadata isn't data</em>, meaning that a geospatial dataset cannot be fully utilized and understood without metadata.</p>
<p>The following section lists some of the common metadata tools that are available. The OGC standard for metadata management is the <strong>Catalog Service for the Web</strong> (<strong>CSW</strong>), which creates a metadata-based catalog system and an API for distributing and discovering datasets.</p>

<p><kbd>pycsw</kbd> is an OGC-compliant CSW for the publishing and discovery of geospatial metadata. It supports multiple APIs, including CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, and SRU. It is extremely lightweight and pure Python. For an excellent example of a CSW and client that was built using <kbd>pycsw</kbd>, see the <strong>Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System</strong> (<strong>PacIOOS</strong>) catalog, available at the following link: <a href="http://pacioos.org/search/">http://pacioos.org/search/</a>. The <kbd>pycsw</kbd> library is also used in a larger package called <strong>GeoNode</strong>.</p>

<p>GeoNode is a Python-based geospatial content management system. It combines geospatial data creation, metadata, and visualization in a single server package. It also includes social features, such as comments and rating systems. It is open source and is available at <a href="http://geonode.org/">http://geonode.org/</a>. The following screenshot is from the GeoNode online demo:</p>

<p>GeoNetwork is an open source, Java-based catalog server used to manage geospatial data. It includes a metadata editor and search engine, as well as an interactive web map viewer. The system is designed to globally connect spatial data infrastructures. It can publish metadata through the web using the metadata editing tools. It can also publish spatial data through the embedded GeoServer map server. It has user and group security permissions, and web and desktop configuration utilities.</p>
<p>GeoNetwork can also be configured in order to harvest metadata from other catalogs at scheduled intervals. The following screenshot is of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's implementation of GeoNetwork:</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, you learned about the hierarchy of geospatial analysis software. You also learned a framework for approaching the hundreds of existing geospatial software packages and libraries, by categorizing them into one or more major functions, including data access, computational geometry, raster processing, visualization, and metadata management.</p>
<p>We also examined commonly used foundation libraries, including GDAL, OGR, PROJ, and GEOS, which are found again and again in geospatial software. You can approach any new piece of geospatial software, trace it back to these core libraries, and then ask, <em>w</em><em>hat is the value added?</em> to gain a better understanding of the package. If the software isn't using one of these libraries, you need to ask, <em>why are these developers going against the grain?</em> in order to understand what that system brings to the table.</p>
<p>Python was only mentioned a few times in this chapter so as to avoid any distraction in understanding the geospatial software landscape. But, as we will see, Python is interwoven into every single piece of software in this chapter and is a fully capable geospatial tool in its own right. It is no coincidence that Python is the official scripting language of ArcGIS, QGIS, GRASS, and many other packages. It is also not by chance that GDAL, OGR, PROJ, CGAL, JTS, GEOS, and PostGIS all have Python bindings.</p>
<p>And as for the packages not mentioned here, they are all within Python's grasp through the Jython Java distribution, the IronPython .NET distribution, Python's various database and web APIs, and the built-in <kbd>ctypes</kbd> module. As a geospatial analyst, if there's one technology you can't afford to pass up, it's Python.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll see how Python comes into the picture in the geospatial industry. We'll also learn about the GIS scripting language, the mashup glue language, and the full-blown programming language.</p>
