- en: This part of the book builds the practical and theoretical foundations of network
    science and introduces two Python packages useful in analyzing networks. *Part
    1* details several examples of data science problems that can be formulated as
    network science problems, including problems to do with social relationship data,
    neural network architectures, ontologies, time series data, and spatiotemporal
    data. This part also establishes foundational topics in graph theory, including
    categories of graphs and formal definitions, and introduces the igraph and NetworkX
    Python packages through example networks.
