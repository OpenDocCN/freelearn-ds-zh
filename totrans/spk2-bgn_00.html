The research paper <em>Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center</em> talks about the philosophy behind the design of Spark. A very simplistic reference implementation built to test Mesos by the University of California Berkeley researchers has grown far and beyond to become a full blown data processing framework later became one of the most active Apache projects. It is designed from the ground up to do distributed data processing on clusters such as Hadoop, Mesos, and in standalone mode. Spark is a JVM-based data processing framework and hence it works on most operating systems that support JVM-based applications. Spark is widely installed on UNIX and Mac OS X, platforms and Windows adoption is increasing.</p><p>Spark provides a unified programming model using the programming languages Scala, Java, Python and R. In other words, irrespective of the language used to program Spark applications, the API remains almost the same in all the languages. In this way, organizations can adopt Spark and develop applications in their programming language of choice. This also enables fast porting of Spark applications from one language to another without much effort, if there is a need. Most of Spark is developed using Scala and because of that the Spark programming model inherently supports functional programming principles. The most basic Spark data abstraction is the resilient distributed data set (RDD), based on which all the other libraries are built. The RDD-based Spark programming model is the lowest level where developers can build data processing applications.</p><p>Spark has grown fast, to cater to the needs of more data processing use cases. When such a forward-looking step is taken with respect to the product road map, the requirement emerged to make the programming more high level for business users.  The Spark SQL library on top of Spark Core, with its DataFrame abstraction, was built to cater to the needs of the huge population of developers who are very conversant with the ubiquitous SQL.</p><p>Data scientists use R for their computation needs. The biggest limitation of R is that all the data that needs to be processed should <em>fit</em> into the main memory of the computer on which the R program is running. The R API for Spark introduced data scientists to the world of distributed data processing in their familiar data frame abstraction. In other words, using the R API for Spark, the processing of data can be done in parallel on Hadoop or Mesos, growing far beyond the limitation of the resident memory of the host computer.</p><p>In the present era of large-scale applications that collect data, the velocity of the data that is ingested is very high. Many application use cases mandate real-time processing of the data that is streamed. The Spark Streaming library, built on top of Spark Core, does exactly the same.</p><p>The data at rest or the data that is streamed are fed to machine learning algorithms  to train data models and use them to provide answers to business questions. All the machine learning frameworks that were created before Spark had many limitations in terms of the memory of the processing computer, inability to do parallel processing, repeated read-write cycles, so on. Spark doesn't have any of these limitations and hence the Spark MLlib machine learning library, built on top of Spark Core and Spark DataFrames, turned out to be the best of breed machine learning library that glues together the data processing pipelines and machine learning activities.</p><p>Graph is a very useful data structure used heavily in some special use cases. The algorithms used to process the data in a graph data structure are computationally intensive. Before Spark, many graph processing frameworks came along, and some of them were really fast at processing, but pre-processing the data needed to produce the graph data structure turned out to be a big bottleneck in most of these graph processing applications. The Spark GraphX library, built on top of Spark, filled this gap to make data processing and graph processing as chained activities.</p><p>In the past, many data processing frameworks existed and many of them were proprietary forcing organizations to get into the trap of vendor lock-in. Spark provided a very viable alternative for a wide variety of data processing needs with no licensing cost; at the same time, it was backed by many leading companies, providing professional production support.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec2"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Spark Fundamentals">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Spark Fundamentals</em>, discusses the fundamentals of Spark as a framework with its APIs and the libraries that comes with it, along with the whole data processing ecosystem Spark is interacting with.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Spark Programming Model">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Spark Programming Model</em>, discusses the uniform programming model, based on the tenets of functional programming methodology, that is used in Spark, and covers the fundamentals of resilient distributed data sets (RDD), Spark transformations, and Spark actions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Spark SQL">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Spark SQL</em>, discusses Spark SQL, which is one of the most powerful Spark libraries used to manipulate data using the ubiquitous SQL constructs in conjunction with the Spark DataFrame API, and and how it works with Spark programs. This chapter also discusses how Spark SQL is used to access data from various data sources, enabling the unification of diverse data sources for data processing.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Spark Programming with R">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Spark Programming with R</em>, discusses SparkR or R on Spark, which is the R API for Spark; this enables R users to make use of the data processing capabilities of Spark using their familiar data frame abstraction. It gives a very good foundation for R users to get acquainted with the Spark data processing ecosystem.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Spark Data Analysis with Python">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Spark Data Analysis with Python</em>, discusses the use of Spark to do data processing and Python to do data analysis, using a wide variety of charting and plotting libraries available for Python. This chapter discusses combining these two related activities together as a Spark application with Python as the programming language of choice.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6.  Spark Stream Processing">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Spark Stream Processing</em>, discusses Spark Streaming, which is one of the most powerful Spark libraries to capture and process data that is ingested as a stream. Kafka as the distributed message broker and a Spark Streaming application as the consumer are also discussed.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7.  Spark Machine Learning">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Spark Machine Learning</em>, discusses Spark MLlib, which is one of the most powerful Spark libraries used to develop machine learning applications at an introductory level.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Spark Graph Processing">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Spark Graph Processing</em>, discusses Spark GraphX, which is one of the most powerful Spark libraries to process graph data structures, and comes with lots of algorithms to process data in graphs. This chapter covers the basics of GraphX and some use cases implemented using the algorithms provided by GraphX.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9.  Designing Spark Applications">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Designing Spark Applications</em>, discusses the design and development of a Spark data processing application, covering various features of Spark that were covered in the previous chapters of this book.</p></div></div>
