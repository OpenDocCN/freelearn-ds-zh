- en: R has become the *lingua franca* of statistical analysis, and it's already actively
    and heavily used in many industries besides the academic sector, where it originated
    more than 20 years ago. Nowadays, more and more businesses are adopting R in production,
    and it has become one of the most commonly used tools by data analysts and scientists,
    providing easy access to thousands of user-contributed packages.

- en: '*Mastering Data Analysis with R* will help you get familiar with this open
    source ecosystem and some statistical background as well, although with a minor
    focus on mathematical questions. We will primarily focus on how to get things
    done practically with R.'

- en: As data scientists spend most of their time fetching, cleaning, and restructuring
    data, most of the first hands-on examples given here concentrate on loading data
    from files, databases, and online sources. Then, the book changes its focus to
    restructuring and cleansing data—still not performing actual data analysis yet.
    The later chapters describe special data types, and then classical statistical
    models are also covered, with some machine learning algorithms.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Hello, Data!"), *Hello, Data!*, starts with
    the first very important task in every data-related task: loading data from text
    files and databases. This chapter covers some problems of loading larger amounts
    of data into R using improved CSV parsers, pre-filtering data, and comparing support
    for various database backends.'

    from the Web*, extends your knowledge on importing data with packages designed
    to communicate with Web services and APIs, shows how to scrape and extract data
    from home pages, and gives a general overview of dealing with XML and JSON data
    formats.'

    and Summarizing Data*, continues with the basics of data processing by introducing
    multiple methods and ways of filtering and aggregating data, with a performance
    and syntax comparison of the deservedly popular `data.table` and `dplyr` packages.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Restructuring Data"), *Restructuring Data*,
    covers more complex data transformations, such as applying functions on subsets
    of a dataset, merging data, and transforming to and from long and wide table formats,
    to perfectly fit your source data with your desired data workflow.'

    and Gergely Toth)"), *Building Models (authored by Renata Nemeth and Gergely Toth)*,
    is the first chapter that deals with real statistical models, and it introduces
    the concepts of regression and models in general. This short chapter explains
    how to test the assumptions of a model and interpret the results via building
    a linear multivariate regression model on a real-life dataset.'

    problems of non-linear associations of predictor variables and provides further
    examples on generalized linear models, such as logistic and Poisson regression.'

    data through some hands-on examples on text mining algorithms, and visualize the
    results.'

    another common issue with raw data sources. Most of the time, data scientists
    handle dirty-data problems, such as trying to cleanse data from errors, outliers,
    and other anomalies. On the other hand, it''s also very important to impute or
    minimize the effects of missing values.'

    to which end we cover some statistical methods on dimension reduction and other
    data transformations on continuous variables, such as principal component analysis,
    factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling.'
