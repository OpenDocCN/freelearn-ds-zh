Various tools evolved over time, but when Apache Spark came, it provided one single runtime to address all these challenges. It eliminated the need to combine multiple tools with their own challenges and learning curves. By using memory for persistent storage besides compute, Apache Spark eliminates the need to store intermedia data in disk and increases processing speed up to 100 times. It also provides a single runtime, which addresses various analytics needs such as machine-learning and real-time streaming using various libraries.</p><p>This book covers the installation and configuration of Apache Spark and building solutions using Spark Core, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib, and GraphX libraries.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>For more information on this book's recipes, please visit <a class="ulink" href="http://infoobjects.com/spark-cookbook">infoobjects.com/spark-cookbook</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Apache Spark">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Apache Spark</em>, explains how to install Spark on various environments and cluster managers.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Developing Applications with Spark">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Developing Applications with Spark</em>, talks about developing Spark applications on different IDEs and using different build tools.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. External Data Sources">Chapter 3</a>, <em>External Data Sources</em>, covers how to read and write to various data sources.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Spark SQL">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Spark SQL</em>, takes you through the Spark SQL module that helps you to access the Spark functionality using the SQL interface.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Spark Streaming">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Spark Streaming</em>, explores the Spark Streaming library to analyze data from real-time data sources, such as Kafka.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Getting Started with Machine Learning Using MLlib">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Getting Started with Machine Learning Using MLlib</em>, covers an introduction to machine learning and basic artifacts such as vectors and matrices.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Supervised Learning with MLlib – Regression">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Supervised Learning with MLlib – Regression</em>, walks through supervised learning when the outcome variable is continuous.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Supervised Learning with MLlib – Classification">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Supervised Learning with MLlib – Classification</em>, discusses supervised learning when the outcome variable is discrete.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Unsupervised Learning with MLlib">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Unsupervised Learning with MLlib</em>, covers unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Recommender Systems">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Recommender Systems</em>, introduces building recommender systems using various techniques, such as ALS.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Graph Processing Using GraphX">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Graph Processing Using GraphX</em>, talks about various graph processing algorithms using GraphX.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Optimizations and Performance Tuning">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Optimizations and Performance Tuning</em>, covers various optimizations on Apache Spark and performance tuning techniques.</p></div></div>
