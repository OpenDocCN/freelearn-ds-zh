Some use Python as a way to automate their workflows in software, such as ArcGIS or QGIS. Others play around with the nuts and bolts of Python's immense variety of third-party open source geospatial toolkits.</p><p>Given all the programming tools available and the people already familiar with geospatial software, there is no reason why you should have to choose either one or the other. Programmers can now develop their own applications from scratch to better suit their needs. Python is, after all, known as a language for rapid development.</p><p>By developing your own application, you can have fun with it, experiment with new visual layouts and creative designs, create platforms for specialized workflows, and tailor to the needs of others.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Preparing to Build Your Own GIS Application">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Preparing to Build Your Own GIS Application</em></span>, talks about the benefits of developing a custom geospatial application and describes how to set up your development environment, and create your application folder structure.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Accessing Geodata">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Accessing Geodata</em></span>, implements the crucial data loading and saving capabilities of your application for both vector and raster data.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Designing the Visual Look of Our Application">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing the Visual Look of Our Application</em></span>, creates and puts together the basic building blocks of your application's user interface, giving you a first look at what your application will look like.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Rendering Our Geodata">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Rendering Our Geodata</em></span>, adds rendering capabilities so that the user can interactively view, zoom, and pan data inside the application.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Managing and Organizing Geographic Data">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Managing and Organizing Geographic Data</em></span>, creates a basic functionality for splitting, merging, and cleaning both the vector and raster data.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Analyzing Geographic Data">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Analyzing Geographic Data</em></span>, develops basic analysis functionality, such as overlay statistics, for vector and raster data.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Packaging and Distributing Your Application">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packaging and Distributing Your Application</em></span>, wraps it all up by showing you how to share and distribute your application, so it is easier for you or others to use it.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Looking Forward">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Looking Forward</em></span>, considers how you may wish to proceed to further build on, customize, and extend your basic application into something more elaborate or specialized in whichever way you want.</p></div></div></div>


  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>There are no real requirements for this book. However, to keep the book short and sweet, the instructions assume that you have a Windows operating system. If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, you should still be able create and run the application, but then you will have to figure out the equivalent installation instructions for your operating system. You may be forced to deal with compiling C++ code and face the potential of unexpected errors. All other installations will be covered throughout the book, including which Python version to use.</p></div></div>


  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is ideal for Python programmers and software developers who are tasked with or wish to make a customizable special-purpose GIS application, or are interested in expanding their knowledge of working with spatial data cleaning, analysis, or map visualization. Analysts, political scientists, geographers, and GIS specialists seeking a creative platform to experiment with cutting-edge spatial analysis, but are still only beginners in Python, will also find this book beneficial. Familiarity with Tkinter application development in Python is preferable but not mandatory.</p></div></div>
