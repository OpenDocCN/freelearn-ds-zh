    support for geographic objects; throughout this book you will find recipes that
    will guide you step by step to explore the different functionalities it offers.
  prefs: []

- en: The purpose of the book is to become a useful tool for understanding the capabilities
    of PostGIS and how to apply them in no time. Each recipe presents a preparation
    stage, in order to organize your workspace with everything you may need, then
    the set of steps that you need to perform in order to achieve the main goal of
    the task, that includes all the external commands and SQL sentences you will need
    (which have been tested in Linux, Mac and Windows environments), and finally a
    small summary of the recipe. This book will go over a large set of common tasks
    in geographical information systems and location-based services, which makes it
    a must-have book in your technical library.

    PostGIS using the `COPY` PostgreSQL command.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After creating the table and copying the CSV file rows to the PostgreSQL table,
    you updated the geometric column using one of the geometry constructor functions
    that PostGIS provides (`ST_MakePoint` and `ST_PointFromText` for bi-dimensional
    points).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These geometry constructors (in this case, `ST_MakePoint` and `ST_PointFromText`)
    must always provide the **spatial reference system identifier** (**SRID**) together
    with the point coordinates to define the point geometry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each geometric field added in any table in the database is tracked with a record
    in the `geometry_columns` PostGIS metadata view. In the previous PostGIS version
    (< 2.0), the `geometry_fields` view was a table and needed to be manually updated,
    possibly with the convenient `AddGeometryColumn` function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the same reason, to maintain the updated `geometry_columns` view when dropping
    a geometry column or removing a spatial table in the previous PostGIS versions,
    there were the `DropGeometryColumn` and `DropGeometryTable` functions. With PostGIS
    2.0 and newer, you don't need to use these functions any more, but you can safely
    remove the column or the table with the standard `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`,
    and `DROP TABLE` SQL commands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the last step of the recipe, you have created a spatial index on the table
    to improve performance. Please be aware that as in the case of alphanumerical
    database fields, indexes improve performances only when reading data using the
    `SELECT` command. In this case, you are making a number of updates on the table
    (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`); depending on the scenario, it could be less
    time consuming to drop and recreate the index after the updates.

    the path to the CSV file (the `SrcDataSource` element), the geometry type (the
    `GeometryType` element), the spatial reference definition for the layer (the `LayerSRS`
    element), and the way the driver can derive the geometric information (the `GeometryField`

    to export a PostGIS raster table, reprojecting it to a different spatial reference
    system. This will convert the PostGIS raster table to GeoTiff and reproject it
