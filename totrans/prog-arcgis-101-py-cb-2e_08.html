<a id="id519" class="indexterm"/> use SQL statements to select features or rows through the use of one or more fields or columns in a dataset. An example attribute query would be "Select all land parcels with a property value greater than $500,000". <span class="strong"><strong>Spatial queries</strong></span>
<a id="id520" class="indexterm"/> are used to select features based on some type of spatial relationship. An example might be "Select all land parcels that intersect a 100 year floodplain" or perhaps "Select all streets that are completely within Travis County, Texas". It is also possible to combine attribute and spatial queries. An example might be "Select all land parcels that intersect the 100 year floodplain and have a property value greater than $500,000".</p></div></div></div>

All attribute queries that you execute against feature classes and tables will need to have the correct SQL syntax and also follow various rules depending upon the datatype that you execute the queries against.</p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec138"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating the syntax for attribute queries is one of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks that you'll need to master when creating Python scripts that incorporate the use of the <a id="id522" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Select by Attributes</strong></span> tool. These queries are basically SQL statements along with a few idiosyncrasies that you'll need to master. If you already have a good understanding of creating queries in ArcMap or perhaps an experience with creating SQL statements in other programming languages, then this will be a little easier for you. In addition to creating valid SQL statements, you also need to be aware of some specific Python syntax requirements and some datatype differences that will result in a slightly altered formatting of your statements for some datatypes. In this recipe, you'll learn how to construct valid query syntax and understand the nuances of how different datatypes alter the syntax as well as some Python-specific constructs.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it…"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec139"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>Initially, we're going to take a <a id="id523" class="indexterm"/>look at how queries are constructed in <a id="id524" class="indexterm"/>ArcMap, so that you can get a feel of how they are structured. </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In ArcMap, open <code class="literal">C:\ArcpyBook\Ch8\Crime_Ch8.mxd</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Burglaries in 2009</strong></span> layer and select <span class="strong"><strong>Open Attribute Table</strong></span>.

There are several things we need to do to generate a syntactically correct statement for the Python interpreter. </p><p>One important thing has already been taken care of though. Each field name used in a query needs to be surrounded by double quotes. In this case, <span class="strong"><strong>SVCAREA</strong></span> is the only field used in the query and it has already been enclosed by double quotes. This will always be the case when you're working with shapefiles, file geodatabases, or ArcSDE geodatabases. Here is where it gets a little confusing though. If you're working with data from a personal geodatabase, the field names will need to be enclosed by square brackets instead of double quotes as shown in the following code example. This can certainly leads to confusion for script developers.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
qry = [SVCAREA] = 'North'
</pre></div><p>Now, we need to deal with the single quotes surrounding <span class="strong"><strong>'North'</strong></span>. When querying data from fields that have a <code class="literal">text</code> datatype, the string being evaluated must be enclosed by quotes. If you examine the original query, you'll notice that we have in fact already enclosed the word <code class="literal">North</code> with quotes, so everything should be fine right? Unfortunately, it's not that simple with Python. Quotes, along with a number of other characters, must be escaped with a forward slash followed by the character being escaped. In this case, the escape sequence would be <code class="literal">\'</code>.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Alter your query syntax to incorporate the escape sequence:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">qry = "SVCAREA" = \'North\'</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, the entire query statement should be enclosed with quotes:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">qry = '"SVCAREA" = \'North\''</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>In addition to the <code class="literal">=</code> sign, which tests for equality, there are a number of additional operators that you can use with strings and numeric data, including not equal (<code class="literal">&lt; &gt;</code>), greater than (<code class="literal">&gt;</code>), greater than or equal to (<code class="literal">&gt;=</code>), less than (<code class="literal">&lt;</code>), and less than or equal to (<code class="literal">&lt;=</code>).</p><p>Wildcard <a id="id530" class="indexterm"/>characters including <code class="literal">%</code> and <code class="literal">_</code> can also be used for shapefiles, file geodatabases, and ArcSDE geodatabases. These include <code class="literal">%</code> for representing any number of characters. The <code class="literal">LIKE</code> operator is often used with wildcard characters to perform partial string matching. For example, the following query would find all records with a service area that begins with <code class="literal">N</code> and has any number of characters after.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">qry = '"SVCAREA" LIKE \'N%\''</pre></div><p>The underscore character (<code class="literal">_</code>) can be used to represent a single character. For personal geodatabases the asterisk (<code class="literal">*</code>) is used to represent a wildcard character for any number of characters, while (<code class="literal">?</code>) represents a single character.</p><p>You can also query for the absence of data, also known as <code class="literal">NULL</code> values. A <code class="literal">NULL</code> value is often mistaken for a value of zero, but that is not the case. <code class="literal">NULL</code> values indicate the absence of data, which is different from a value of zero. Null operators include <span class="strong"><strong>IS NULL</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>IS NOT NULL</strong></span>. The following code example will find all records where the <code class="literal">SVCAREA</code> field contains no data:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">qry = '"SVCAREA" IS NULL'</pre></div><p>The final topic that we'll cover in this section are operators used for combining expressions where multiple query conditions need to be met. The <code class="literal">AND</code> operator requires that both query conditions be met for the query result to be true, resulting in selected records. The <code class="literal">OR</code> operator requires that at least one of the conditions be met.</p></div><div class="section" title="How it works…"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec140"/>How it works…</h2></div></div></div><p>The creation of syntactically correct queries is one of the most challenging aspects of programming ArcGIS with Python. However, once you understand some basic rules, it gets a little easier. In this section, we'll summarize these rules. One of the more important things to keep in mind is that field names must be enclosed with double quotes for all datasets, with the exception of personal geodatabases, which require braces surrounding field names.</p><p>There is also an <code class="literal">AddFieldDelimiters()</code> function<a id="id531" class="indexterm"/> that you can use to add the correct delimiter to a field based on the datasource supplied as a parameter to the function. The syntax for this function is as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">AddFieldDelimiters(dataSource,field)</pre></div><p>Additionally, most people, especially those new to programming with Python, struggle with the issue of adding single quotes to string values being evaluated by the query. In Python, quotes have to be escaped with a single forward slash followed by the quote. Using this escape sequence will ensure that Python does in fact see that as a quote rather than the end of the string. </p><p>Finally, <a id="id532" class="indexterm"/>take some time to familiarize yourself with the wildcard characters. For datasets other than personal geodatabases, you'll use the (<code class="literal">%)</code> character for multiple characters and an underscore (_) character for a single character. If you're using a personal geodatabase, the (<code class="literal">*)</code> character is used to match multiple characters and the <code class="literal">(?)</code> character is used to match a single character. Obviously, the syntax differences between personal geodatabases and all other types of datasets can lead to some confusion.</p></div></div></div>

Although these temporary datasets can be saved, they are not needed in most cases. </p><div class="section" title="Getting ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec141"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Feature classes <a id="id535" class="indexterm"/>are physical representations of geographic data and are stored as files (shapefiles, personal geodatabases, and file geodatabases) or within a geodatabase. ESRI<a id="id536" class="indexterm"/> defines a feature class as "a collection of features that shares a common geometry (point, line, or polygon), attribute table, and spatial reference."</p><p>Feature classes can contain default and user-defined fields. Default fields include the <code class="literal">SHAPE</code> and <code class="literal">OBJECTID</code> fields. These fields are maintained and updated automatically by ArcGIS. The <code class="literal">SHAPE</code> field holds the geometric representation of a geographic feature, while the <code class="literal">OBJECTID</code> field holds a unique identifier for each feature. Additional default fields will also exist depending on the type of feature class. A line feature class will have a <code class="literal">SHAPE_LENGTH</code> field. A polygon feature class will have both, a <code class="literal">SHAPE_LENGTH</code> and a <code class="literal">SHAPE_AREA</code> field. </p><p>Optional fields are created by end users of ArcGIS and are not automatically updated by GIS. These contain attribute information about the features. These fields can also be updated by your scripts.</p><p>Tables are<a id="id537" class="indexterm"/> physically represented as standalone DBF tables or within a geodatabase. Both, tables and feature classes, contain attribute information. However, a table contains only attribute information. There isn't a <code class="literal">SHAPE</code> field associated with a table, and they may or may not contain an <code class="literal">OBJECTID</code> field.</p><p>Standalone Python scripts that use the <span class="strong"><strong>Select by Attributes</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Select by Location</strong></span> tool require that you create an intermediate dataset rather than using feature classes or tables. These intermediate datasets are temporary in nature and are called <span class="strong"><strong>Feature Layers</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Table Views</strong></span>. Unlike feature classes and tables, these temporary datasets do not represent actual files on disk or within a geodatabase. Instead, they are "in memory" representations of feature classes and tables. These datasets are active only while a Python script is running. They are removed from memory after the tool has executed. However, if the script is run from within ArcGIS as a script tool, then the temporary layer can be saved either by right-clicking on the layer in the table of contents and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Save As Layer File</strong></span> or simply by saving the map document file.</p><p>Feature layers <a id="id538" class="indexterm"/>
<a id="id539" class="indexterm"/>and table views must be created as a separate step in your Python scripts, before you can call the <span class="strong"><strong>Select by Attributes</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Select by Location</strong></span> tools. The <span class="strong"><strong>Make Feature Layer</strong></span> tool generates the "in-memory" representation of a feature class, which can then be used to create queries and selection sets, as well as to join tables. After this step has been completed, you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Select by Attributes</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Select by Location</strong></span> tool. Similarly, the <span class="strong"><strong>Make Table View</strong></span> tool is used to create an "in-memory" representation of a table. The function of this tool is the same as <span class="strong"><strong>Make Feature Layer</strong></span>. Both the <span class="strong"><strong>Make Feature Layer</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Make Table View</strong></span> tools require an input dataset, an output layer name, and an optional query expression, which can be used to limit the features or rows that are a part of the output layer. In addition, both tools can be found in the <span class="strong"><strong>Data Management</strong></span> Tools toolbox.</p><p>The syntax for using the <span class="strong"><strong>Make Feature Layer</strong></span> tool<a id="id540" class="indexterm"/> is as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">arcpy.MakeFeatureLayer_management(&lt;input feature layer&gt;, &lt;output layer name&gt;,{where clause})</pre></div><p>The syntax for using the <span class="strong"><strong>Make Table View</strong></span> tool<a id="id541" class="indexterm"/> is as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Arcpy.MakeTableView_management(&lt;input table&gt;, &lt;output table name&gt;, {where clause})</pre></div><p>In this recipe, you will learn how to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Make Feature Layer</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Make Table View</strong></span> tools.
