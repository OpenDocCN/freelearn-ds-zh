    allows GIS Professionals to take full advantage of modern computer hardware, which
    brings increased performance and capability that has not been available for the
    desktop. It also has a brand new modern ribbon interface. This is completely different
    from the toolbar-based interface we have become accustomed to in ArcMap or ArcCatalog.
    While more intuitive for completely new users, it can be a bit challenging for
    existing ArcGIS Desktop users.

    tools. For a complete list of the capabilities of each license level of ArcGIS
    Pro, go to [http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/license-levels.htm](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/license-levels.htm).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you started by adding new layers to a map. You added multiple
    layers at one time using the Add Data button. Once you added the new layers, you
    began to adjust their properties so that they would be more useful within the
    map. First, you renamed the layer using a more descriptive and understandable
    name than the one originally associated with the feature class in the geodatabase.
    Then, you updated the metadata for the layer so others using the map would have
    a better understanding of its purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you updated some of the basic properties of the layers you added, you
    worked on the symbology so that the map was easier to read. You made the Streams,
    Creeks, Lakes, and Ponds layers blue so they resembled the features they represent,
    also, people are accustomed to seeing them presented this way in a map. You made
    these adjustments by clicking the symbol patch located beneath each layer and
    then changing the symbol properties in the Symbology pane.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Buildings layer required a little more effort, because you needed to change
    the symbology so that you could tell each building type from within the map. This
    required you to base the symbology on an attribute of the buildings that was stored
    in a field found in the attribute table of the Buildings layer. To do this, you
    went to the Appearance tab and selected the Unique Values symbology. Then, you
    configured this symbology type to use the Building Type field from the attribute
    table for the layer. Once you pointed the symbology type to that field, it automatically
    created a unique symbol for each building type it found. In this case, it created
    a unique symbol allowing you to determine the type of buildings (for example,
    houses or apartments).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You added the Power Poles layer from the Catalog pane by right-clicking the
    feature class within the geodatabase and selecting Add to Current Map. You then
    adjusted the color of the Power Poles symbol to red by right-clicking the symbol
    and selecting Mars Red from the presented color palette.
  prefs: []

    add the map to other projects quickly and easily. The map will be added with all

- en: In this recipe, you created your first new project. You used the Blank template,
    which creates a very basic project for ArcGIS Pro. Projects created with the Blank
    template include connections to a custom toolbox and geodatabase that have the
    same name as the project, along with several styles and locators. The toolbox
    and geodatabase are automatically created by ArcGIS Pro when you create the new
    project. They are both empty and are intended for you to save project-specific
    items to them. However, in most cases, your organization will already have an
    established GIS database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you created your project, you added a connection to an existing geodatabase,
    Trippville_GIS. This database contains the GIS data for the City of Trippville
    that you used in other recipes. This is actually the primary database that you
    will use in the remainder of this book. So, you added it to your favorites and
    set it to automatically be added to all new projects you create.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you established a connection to the primary geodatabase, you imported
    a new map. This new map was based on a Map file you created in a previous recipe.
    The new map was added with layers already added and their properties configured,
    saving you a lot of effort.

    saw, this template automatically created the project structure including a project
    geodatabase, custom toolbox, and more. The blank template is not the only one
    included with ArcGIS Pro. There are several others you can use when creating a
    new project. Let's take a quick look at them.
