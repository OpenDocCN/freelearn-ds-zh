- en: ArcGIS Pro represents a huge step forward in Desktop GIS. This new 64-bit solution
    allows GIS Professionals to take full advantage of modern computer hardware, which
    brings increased performance and capability that has not been available for the
    desktop. It also has a brand new modern ribbon interface. This is completely different
    from the toolbar-based interface we have become accustomed to in ArcMap or ArcCatalog.
    While more intuitive for completely new users, it can be a bit challenging for
    existing ArcGIS Desktop users.

    whether your computer has the capability to run this powerful software. Then you
    will determine which license levels are available to you. This is important as

- en: In this recipe, you started by adding new layers to a map. You added multiple
    layers at one time using the Add Data button. Once you added the new layers, you
    began to adjust their properties so that they would be more useful within the
    map. First, you renamed the layer using a more descriptive and understandable
    name than the one originally associated with the feature class in the geodatabase.
    Then, you updated the metadata for the layer so others using the map would have
    a better understanding of its purpose.
  id: totrans-251
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you updated some of the basic properties of the layers you added, you
    worked on the symbology so that the map was easier to read. You made the Streams,
    Creeks, Lakes, and Ponds layers blue so they resembled the features they represent,
    also, people are accustomed to seeing them presented this way in a map. You made
    these adjustments by clicking the symbol patch located beneath each layer and
    then changing the symbol properties in the Symbology pane.
  id: totrans-252
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Buildings layer required a little more effort, because you needed to change
    the symbology so that you could tell each building type from within the map. This
    required you to base the symbology on an attribute of the buildings that was stored
    in a field found in the attribute table of the Buildings layer. To do this, you
    went to the Appearance tab and selected the Unique Values symbology. Then, you
    configured this symbology type to use the Building Type field from the attribute
    table for the layer. Once you pointed the symbology type to that field, it automatically
    created a unique symbol for each building type it found. In this case, it created
    a unique symbol allowing you to determine the type of buildings (for example,
    houses or apartments).

    feature class within the geodatabase and selecting Add to Current Map. You then
    adjusted the color of the Power Poles symbol to red by right-clicking the symbol
    and selecting Mars Red from the presented color palette.

    add the map to other projects quickly and easily. The map will be added with all
    the layer properties and settings that you just configured, so you will not need
    to go through that process again.
