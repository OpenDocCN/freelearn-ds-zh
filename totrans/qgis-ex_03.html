QGIS has powerful capabilities of creating single-page or multipage (so-called atlases) maps that you can export in multiple, easy-to-distribute, and print graphical formats (for example, .pdf, .png, .svg, and so on).</p><p>In this chapter, you will be exposed to QGIS's main tool for creating print maps, called <strong>print composer</strong>, and will learn how to use it to get outstanding results.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec22"/>Print composer</h1></div></div></div><p>With print composer, map designing<a id="id205" class="indexterm"/> becomes easy and intuitive, as it allows you to set up a layout and add a map and its necessary elements, such as text labels, the legend, the scale bar, and the north arrow. Moreover, you can significantly enliven your map by combining multiple overviews, images, drawings, and HTML labels. To simplify map generation and save your time, you can use map templates and the atlas generator functionality.</p><p>To enter print composer mode, go<a id="id206" class="indexterm"/> to <strong>Project</strong> | <strong>New Print Composer</strong> from the menu, click on the <img src="img/image00363.jpeg" alt="Print composer"/> button on the <strong>File</strong> toolbar, or just use the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>P</em> keyboard shortcut. In the <strong>Composer title</strong> dialog window, you will be asked to give a title to your map. Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button for the title to be generated automatically (<code class="literal">Composer 1</code>, <code class="literal">Composer 2</code>, <code class="literal">Composer 3</code>, and so on; you will be able to rename them later if you want).</p><p>In the upper row of the print composer window, there are drop-down menus that provide access to its options and functionality. The upper row of toolbars provides quick-access buttons for the same functionality. Note that the <strong>Composer Items</strong> toolbar is, by default, placed separately on the left side of the window because it provides quick access to all elements that are usually necessary to constitute a map, for example, a map canvas, a legend, a scale bar, labels, annotations, and so on. In the central part of the window, you can see an empty page that represents the composer canvas available for item arrangement, as shown here:</p><div><img src="img/image00364.jpeg" alt="Print composer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In the right part <a id="id207" class="indexterm"/>of the print composer window, there are two panels with tabs. The upper panel holds the following tabs:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Items</strong>: This displays the list of map items added to the map. It allows you to define their visibility, rename, reorder, and lock them for changes.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Command history</strong>: This displays the list of commands used. With the history, you can easily roll back changes and have better control over the process of map generation.</li></ul></div><p>The lower panel holds three tabs, as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Composition</strong>: This is responsible for <strong>Paper and quality</strong> (page size, number, and resolution) and <strong>Guides and Grid</strong> (spacing and snapping tolerance) so as to simplify map item placement.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Item properties</strong>: This is a dynamic tab whose contents changes automatically, depending on the map item currently selected.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Atlas generation</strong>: Once the <strong>Generate an atlas</strong> toggle is active, you can set and modify its <a id="id208" class="indexterm"/>parameters.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"/>Note</h3><p>Note that it is only the default panels' placement that can be rearranged. In order to change the panel/tab position, hover your mouse arrow over its perforated area, which looks like this:</p><div><img src="img/image00365.jpeg" alt="Print composer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Now, drag and drop it at another place. You can also close any unnecessary panel by clicking on the button in its top-right corner. Also, panels can be turned on or off with the toggles that become available after right-clicking on the menu or the toolbar's panel, that is, when you see something like this:</p><div><img src="img/image00366.jpeg" alt="Print composer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div></li></ul></div><p>You can get additional control over composer settings from its <strong>Composer Options</strong> menu, which can be found under <strong>Settings</strong>. For example, you might want to change the <strong>Default font</strong> that will be used for the legend and text labels. For further work in the <strong>Grid appearance</strong> section, we set <strong>Grid style</strong> to <strong>Solid</strong> and leave <strong>Grid and guide defaults</strong> unchanged, as we will configure them later.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec23"/>The initial setup – page format and other essentials</h1></div></div></div><p>Before creating the map, we should set up our working space, which is mainly defined by page settings. All the necessary <a id="id209" class="indexterm"/>options are present under the <strong>Composition</strong> tab. Let's take a closer look at the <strong>Paper and quality</strong> section. The default page size in the <strong>Presets</strong> drop-down list is <strong>A4</strong>, but you can select from among 23 other sizes. We <a id="id210" class="indexterm"/>are going to create our own page by performing the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Custom</strong> from the list.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> fields will be activated. Enter a value of <code class="literal">200</code> for both of them (this means that we are going to create a square page for a map composition). The value depends on the units chosen in<strong> Units</strong>, and by default, it is set to <strong>mm</strong> (millimeters).</li></ol><div></div><p>As we are going to create only one map, we leave <strong>Number of pages</strong> as 1, but you can always enter more if you're going to combine several pages into one document. This is because you could have several maps in a single-page composition. As shown in the example, we're using a square page. So, it doesn't matter whether it has the <strong>Portrait</strong> or <strong>Landscape</strong> page orientation. <strong>Page background</strong> is a very important item as it allows you to achieve cool cartographic visualization effects. By clicking on the <strong>Change</strong> button, you can see that, by default, it is set to <strong>Simple fill</strong> with white color (which we are going to use). However, you can change it and select from among multiple filling options to create an original filling pattern.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip14"/>Tip</h3><p>For example, you can find nice raster or SVG textures and use them as background patterns by selecting <strong>Raster image fill</strong> or <strong>SVG fill</strong> respectively. Otherwise, you can select <strong>Gradient</strong> or <strong>Shapeburst fill</strong> to play around with some color grading effects.</p></div><p><strong>Export resolution</strong> defines the quality of the exported map in dpi units. The higher this value, the better the map. However, the resulting file will also be bigger. For common purposes, such as publications, reports, and presentation graphics, <code class="literal">300 dpi</code> is enough. When the <strong>Print as raster</strong> toggle is active, the entire composition is converted into raster before exporting to <code class="literal">.pdf</code>. The <strong>World file on</strong> toggle allows you to attach a <code class="literal">.wld</code> file that contains information about a geographic reference to the image export output. This means that your map can not only be viewed in graphical or preview software, but can also be opened and aligned properly directly in GIS software.</p><p>Now, we will adjust the grid that will be<a id="id211" class="indexterm"/> used to align map items within a map layout:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Guides and Grid</strong> section, enter <code class="literal">5</code> mm as the <strong>Grid spacing</strong> value to make it denser, and set <strong>Snap tolerance</strong> to <code class="literal">10</code> pixels (the higher the value, the stronger the snapping).</li><li class="listitem">To show the grid, activate the <strong>Show grid</strong> button, which is under <strong>View</strong>, or use the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>'</em> keyboard shortcut.</li><li class="listitem">Toggle <strong>Snap to grid</strong>, which is under <strong>View</strong>, or pressing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>'</em> activates snapping.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip15"/>Tip</h3><p>Instead of using a predefined grid, you can create your own guidelines by placing the mouse arrow over horizontal (for vertical guidelines) or vertical (for horizontal guidelines) ruler bars and clicking and dragging them along the page canvas. Deactivate <strong>Snap to Grid</strong> and use various options from the <strong>View</strong> menu such as <strong>Show/Clear</strong> or <strong>Snap to Guides</strong>. The <strong>Smart Guides</strong> option helps you detect the best placement position automatically based on the other items in your composition.</p></div></li></ol><div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec24"/>Adding and customizing a map</h1></div></div></div><p>In this section, we <a id="id212" class="indexterm"/>are going to create a population map of the Brooklyn borough. Make sure that<a id="id213" class="indexterm"/> in the main window, the following layers are active: <code class="literal">Brooklyn borough boundaries</code>, <code class="literal">zipcode</code> (with the population style), <code class="literal">NY borough boundaries</code>, and <code class="literal">water area</code>.</p><p>To add a map to your print layout, click on the <strong>Add new map</strong> <img src="img/image00367.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/> button in the <strong>Composer Items</strong> toolbar, and drag the mouse arrow diagonally over the page while holding down the left mouse button. You will see a rectangle drawn on the page and a map inside it.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"/>Note</h3><p>Note that the content of the map changes dynamically to reflect the content of the map canvas in the main window. This means that if you turn on/off some layers in the main window, or change their styling, the map in the print composer window will be changed too. If you don't see the changes, click on the <strong>Refresh view</strong> <img src="img/image00368.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/> button to update the map. We will discuss how to suppress this behavior soon.</p></div><p>The map frame can be moved or resized by dragging the special squared markers on the borders' centers <a id="id214" class="indexterm"/>and corners. If you don't see the frame and markers, it means that the current item is inactive. To activate it, click on the <strong>Select/Move item</strong> <img src="img/image00369.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/> button in the <strong>Composer Items</strong> toolbar. If you want to move a map inside the frame, use the <strong>Move item content</strong> button, <img src="img/image00370.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/>, in the <strong>Composer Items</strong> toolbar. Also, as long as this button is active, you can zoom into the map with the mouse wheel (or with <em>Ctrl</em> and the mouse wheel). Using markers, extend the map in such a way that it covers the whole page.</p><p>After placing the map<a id="id215" class="indexterm"/> properly, we can proceed to the advanced options on the <strong>Item properties</strong> tab. The tab brings together several sections that can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the <img src="img/image00371.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/> symbol beside them.</p><p>The <strong>Main properties</strong> section allows<a id="id216" class="indexterm"/> you to select from the following map preview modes:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Cache</strong>: This renders the map in the current screen resolution, which will not change while zooming in/out, but the image itself will be scaled properly.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Render</strong>: The map resolution will be adjusted to the maximum value while zooming. This mode gives better a preview picture, but is slower comparing to <strong>Cache</strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Rectangle</strong>: Instead of a map, a <code class="literal">Map will be printed here</code> message will be shown in an empty box.</li></ul></div><p>When you enter some values in the <strong>Scale</strong> field, the map extent changes dynamically. Set its value to <code class="literal">100000</code> and use the <strong>Move item content</strong> <img src="img/image00370.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/> button to locate map within frame properly. The following screenshot shows you how the tab <strong>Item properties</strong> looks like at this stage:</p><div><img src="img/image00372.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>With the <a id="id217" class="indexterm"/><strong>Map rotation</strong> field, you can define an angle in degrees to rotate the map clockwise within its frame. Note that the angle of rotation will be applied automatically to the<a id="id218" class="indexterm"/> grid lines to adjust them properly with respect to the map's content. There are three toggles and they provide the following options:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">When the <strong>Draw map canvas items</strong> toggle is activated, existing annotations from the main map canvas window will be added to the map.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Lock layers for map item</strong> option is very useful if you don't want your print map to reflect changes made in the main map canvas window. So, the layers will remain the same, but their styling and labeling will change according to the main window. We activate this option because we don't want the composition of layers to be changed.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Lock layer styles for map item</strong> blocks the map item from style changes made in the main map canvas window. Activate this option too. Jointly applied with the previous option, it allows us to block the composer map from changes made in the main map canvas window (that is, the layers' style and composition).</li></ul></div><p>On the right-hand side of the toggles, there is a <strong>Set layer list from a visibility preset</strong> button, <img src="img/image00373.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/>. This<a id="id219" class="indexterm"/> button allows us to quickly define map item content from the visibility presets on the toolbar of the <strong>Layers</strong> panel. To load a preset, click on the small triangular arrow in the<a id="id220" class="indexterm"/> bottom-right corner of the button, and select the preset you want to show on the map. The map's content will be changed according to the preset and the layers will be locked automatically.</p><p>The <strong>Extents</strong> section provides various options to define and adjust the map item's extent:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Manual definition, by entering <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> values in the correspondent fields.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Set to map canvas extent</strong>: The current map extent will become the same as the extent of the main map canvas window.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>View extent in map canvas</strong>: This does exactly the opposite of the previous button. It changes the map canvas extent in the main window according to the current map item extent.</li></ul></div><p>The <strong>Controlled by atlas</strong> section will be covered later, when we talk about atlas generation in the <em>Creating atlases</em> section.</p><p>The <strong>Grids</strong> section allows you to add coordinate grids and frames to the map frame. To add a new grid, click on the <img src="img/image00374.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a map"/> button and adjust its main properties, such as <strong>Grid type</strong>, <strong>Interval</strong>, <strong>Grid frame</strong>, <strong>Coordinates</strong>, and so on.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip16"/>Tip</h3><p>You can combine multiple grids that use different coordinate reference systems within a single map item. Just add one more grid. Then, in the <strong>Draw "Grid 2" grid</strong> section, click on the <strong>Change</strong> button beside <strong>CRS</strong> and select the CRS you want to use. A common use case of this option is to combine a projected CRS, which uses linear measurement units (feet and meter), with a geodetic CRS, which provides latitude and longitude coordinates in degrees.</p></div><p>The <strong>Overviews</strong> section allows you to combine multiple overviews in various scales into a single map composition. This will be covered later, in the <em>Working with map overviews</em> section.</p><p>The following sections<a id="id221" class="indexterm"/> are common for various map items:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <strong>Position and size</strong><a id="id222" class="indexterm"/> section allows you to define the size of the item frame in page units. <strong>Reference point</strong> decides which corner of the item is specified by the X and Y positions.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Rotation field</strong> values set the item's rotation angle in degrees.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Frame</strong> toggle enables the frame around the item, and provides access to its options, such as <strong>Frame color</strong>, <strong>Thickness</strong>, and <strong>Join style</strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Background</strong> is responsible for the frame's fill color.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Item ID</strong> can be used with web clients to create links between map items, and also for easier identification of specific items within the <strong>Items</strong> panel.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Rendering</strong> provides access to the <strong>Blending mode</strong> and <strong>Transparency</strong> options that allow us to apply professional graphics affects.</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec25"/>Adding and customizing a legend</h1></div></div></div><p>A legend is a necessary element in<a id="id223" class="indexterm"/> any map. It provides explanations of the layers' symbology and helps us read and understand the map. To add a legend, click on the <a id="id224" class="indexterm"/><strong>Add a new legend</strong> <img src="img/image00375.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> button in the <strong>Composer Items</strong> toolbar, and drag the mouse arrow diagonally over the page while holding down the left mouse button. You will see a rectangle drawn on the page and a legend inside it. By default, all layers in the project will be included in the legend, so it may look too big to fit the layout. With the legend item selected, you can use the <strong>Item properties</strong> tab to customize its content and appearance. There are several legend-specific sections that should be discussed.</p><p>The <strong>Main properties</strong> section allows you to customize the following options:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Title</strong>: By default, the <code class="literal">Legend</code> title is used, but you can type any other text here, or leave the field empty to remove the title.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Title alignment</strong>: This can align the title to <strong>Left</strong>, <strong>Center</strong>, or <strong>Right</strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Map</strong>: By default, there is only <strong>Map 0</strong> available, but if you combine several maps within a single page layout, you can decide which map the legend will refer to.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Wrap text on</strong>: Type here a symbol that will be used to separate long lines into shorter chunks of text. Later, you can edit text in the legend item and insert this symbol wherever necessary to forcibly start a new line.</li></ul></div><p>The <strong>Legend items</strong> <a id="id225" class="indexterm"/>section is responsible for the content of the legend. By default, the <strong>Auto update</strong> mode is active, and all available layers are loaded into the legend. Turn the <strong>Auto update</strong> mode off and the buttons below the legend contents tree will be activated, providing the following options (from left to right):</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <strong>down</strong><img src="img/image00376.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> and <strong>up</strong><img src="img/image00377.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> buttons are<a id="id226" class="indexterm"/> used to move items and change their order. Otherwise, you can simply drag and drop an item at a new position. After any changes the legend's item content is immediately updated.
</li><li class="listitem">
The <strong>add group</strong><img src="img/image00378.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> button allows you to<a id="id227" class="indexterm"/> add new groups and subgroups to develop a legend hierarchy.
</li><li class="listitem">
The <strong>plus</strong><img src="img/image00374.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> and <strong>minus</strong><img src="img/image00379.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> buttons are responsible for adding and removing any item, whether it is<a id="id228" class="indexterm"/> a group or a layer. Note that only<a id="id229" class="indexterm"/> layers active in the main map canvas window are available for adding.
</li><li class="listitem">
The <strong>edit</strong><img src="img/image00380.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> button allows us to change<a id="id230" class="indexterm"/> the text for any selected item (group, subgroup, layer, or symbology label). For example, if you want a long line to be wrapped, insert in the text symbol defined in the <strong>Main properties</strong> section. These changes are applied only within a <strong>print composer legend</strong> item and <a id="id231" class="indexterm"/>don't affect map items in the main window.
</li><li class="listitem">
The <strong>sum</strong><img src="img/image00381.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> button shows the feature count for<a id="id232" class="indexterm"/> each class of the vector layer.
</li><li class="listitem">
The <strong>filter</strong><img src="img/image00382.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/> button filters the<a id="id233" class="indexterm"/> legend by map content; that is, only the legend items (layers and classes) that are shown in the map item will be included in the legend.
</li></ul></div><p>In the <strong>Fonts</strong> section, you<a id="id234" class="indexterm"/> can define a common color and different fonts for the title, subgroups, groups, and items to enhance the legend's readability. If the legend contains many items and is too long to be shown in a single column, it can be split in the <strong>Columns</strong> section. Here, you can define the number of columns in the <strong>Count</strong> field. By default, the column's width is adjusted according to the content. If you want it to be set equally for all columns, activate the <strong>Equal column widths</strong> toggle. If the <strong>Split layers</strong> mode is on, categorized layer symbology items will be allocated equally among columns; otherwise, categories are not allowed to be moved into another column. In the<a id="id235" class="indexterm"/> following screenshot, you can see how this works. At the top, there is a legend in which layer splitting is prohibited, and at the bottom, the categories are equally split between three columns.</p><div><img src="img/image00383.jpeg" alt="Adding and customizing a legend"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In the <strong>Symbol</strong> section, the<a id="id236" class="indexterm"/> default <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> values can be modified manually. <strong>WMS Legend Graphic</strong> is used to add a legend for a WMS layer, but this is if it is supported and provided by the WMS server. In the dialog window, you can resize the legend width and height that is provided as a raster image. The <strong>Spacing</strong> section allows <a id="id237" class="indexterm"/>you to refine the legend's layout and readability by adjusting the spaces between its various items: title, groups, subgroups, symbols, icon labels, bounding box, and columns.</p><p>Other sections, such as <strong>Position and Size</strong>, <strong>Rotation</strong>, <strong>Frame</strong>, <strong>Background</strong>, <strong>Item ID</strong>, and <strong>Rendering</strong>, provide the same options as those for the map item.</p></div>

To achieve this, you need to perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the main map canvas window, activate the <code class="literal">NY borough boundaries</code> layer and deactivate all other layers. Create a new print composer, use the default <strong>A4</strong> page size, and adjust any other properties required. Add a new map item to the layout. This map will be used to show simple boundaries and provide spatial context for the main map, so it may be encompassed in a small 95 x 95 mm frame with a scale of 1:515,000. After you have adjusted the map view, don't forget to select <strong>Lock layers for map item</strong> and <strong>Lock layers styles for map item</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Now, you will be adding the main map, and it will be the core of the layout. In the main map canvas window, activate the layers you wish to show on the map (for example, <code class="literal">hurricane evacuation zones</code> and <code class="literal">primary residential zoning</code>). Again, add a new map item to the layout and adjust its size, scale, and position. For example, it might be of 200 x 200 mm with a scale of 1:97,000. Again, use <strong>Lock layers for map item</strong> and <strong>Lock layers styles for map item</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, add the third map. Activate the layers you wish to show in the map in the main map canvas window (for example, <code class="literal">hillshade</code>, and <code class="literal">height a.s.l., ft</code>). Add a new map item. Adjust the map size to 95 x 95 mm and set the scale to <code class="literal">20000</code>. Move the item content to show the area you are interested in and select <strong>Lock layers for map item</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">
Now, we need to relate the map extents with each other. We can do this with the help of overviews. Activate the very first map item you added and expand the <strong>Overviews</strong> section under the <strong>Item properties</strong> tab. To add a new overview, click on the <img src="img/image00374.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/> button, and to show it on the map, activate the <strong>Draw "Name" overview</strong> toggle. To relate an overview with a map item extent, select the map<a id="id266" class="indexterm"/> from the <strong>Map frame</strong> drop-down list. You can change the default <strong>Frame style</strong> using the <strong>Symbol selector</strong> dialog window.
<div><img src="img/image00400.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><strong>Blending mode</strong> is useful for achieving more stylish effects when combining several overview frames. The <strong>Invert overview</strong> toggle will invert the fill of the overview outside of its area. <strong>Center on overview</strong> will move the map item content to place an overview in its center.
Add another overview that encompasses <strong>Map frame</strong> with a smaller extent using the <img src="img/image00374.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/> button. You can combine as many overviews as you want. Use the <img src="img/image00379.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/> button to remove unnecessary overviews and the <img src="img/image00377.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/> and <img src="img/image00376.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/> buttons to<a id="id267" class="indexterm"/> reorder them.
</li><li class="listitem">
Go to another map and add an overview to it. Select the map item you are interested in and go to its <strong>Properties</strong> tab. Expand the <strong>Overviews</strong> section and click on the <img src="img/image00374.jpeg" alt="Working with map overviews"/> button to add an overview. Select a necessary map from the <strong>Map frame</strong> drop-down list and adjust the overview's <strong>Frame style</strong>.

The idea underlying atlases is very simple—very often, the user needs to generate several small maps, instead of one big map. To arrange multiple maps properly within several pages, an atlas coverage layer is used. This coverage layer may contain various types of geometry (points, lines, and polygons) that are used to define the general extent of the map, separate sheet's extents, their quantity, and their sequence. The most common example of an atlas is a large area (for example, a country, borough, or watershed basin) separated into several parts based on its subunits (for example, regions, states, counties, or subbasins).</p><p>In this example tutorial, we will generate multiple street network maps using the <code class="literal">zipcode</code> layer elements as bounding extents for multiple maps. Moreover, we will use a specially designed plugin to mask all excluded areas and achieve stylish cartographic effects:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First of all, we enable the layers that we are going to create our map from: <code class="literal">Brooklyn borough boundaries</code>, <code class="literal">zipcode</code>, <code class="literal">water area</code>, <code class="literal">parks</code>, and <code class="literal">roads</code>.</li><li class="listitem">For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to use the external <strong>Mask</strong> plugin. This plugin allows the user to create a map-masking layer and also filter the labeling of other layers, removing labels that are outside the area of interest. It is also able to interact with the atlas generation process. Install and activate the <strong>Mask</strong> plugin as described in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Handling Your Data" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S2">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Handling Your Data</em>.</li><li class="listitem">
When the<a id="id269" class="indexterm"/> plugin is activated, we need to provide it with layer features on which masking will be based. In our case, this will be <code class="literal">zipcode</code>. Activate it. Then, using the <strong>Select features by area or single click</strong><img src="img/image00402.jpeg" alt="Creating atlases"/> mode, click on the map canvas to select any feature.
</li><li class="listitem">
Once the selected polygon is highlighted, go to <strong>Plugins</strong> | <strong>Mask</strong> | <strong>Create a mask</strong> and open the <strong>Create a mask</strong> dialog window. In this window, you can define the following properties of the mask:
<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong>Style</strong> of the masking polygon, which, by default, uses <strong>Inverted polygons renderer</strong> with the <strong>Shapeburst fill</strong> option, modified by <strong>Transparency</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Buffer</strong> toggle generates a buffer around the area of interest whose width and complexity are defined by the <strong>Units</strong> and <strong>Segments</strong> values.</li><li class="listitem">On-the-fly simplification is used for the mask geometry used in expressions. The higher the value, the coarser the geometry.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Function used for labeling filtering on polygons</strong> defines how exactly labels outside the masking polygon will be eliminated.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>Function used for labeling filtering on lines</strong> defines the exclusion mode for line labels.

The selected polygon feature looks highlighted, while the outer map is faded out. Also, labels appear only within the masked feature. Now we can deactivate the <code class="literal">zipcode</code> layer, as we don't want its borders to be shown on the resulting map, and proceed to print composer to generate an atlas.</li><li class="listitem">Open a new print composer and add to it a new map item and any other items you want to include in the layout.
