<p>In the previous three chapters, we learned how to create increasingly more complex calculations in Tableau. Now that we have the tools to develop powerful workbooks, let's see if we can leverage Tableau's analytics capabilities to bring some color to our data, either with graphical elements, such as reference lines or bands, or using forecasting to predict future data.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic tools in the Tableau Analytics pane</li>
<li>Additional analytical options</li>
<li>Using forecasting</li>
<li>A practical example</li>
</ul>

<p>Tableau holds a set of ready-made analytical tools that can be simply dragged and dropped onto a view. Those functions can be found in the <span class="packt_screen">Analytics</span> pane, usually by clicking on the tab next to <span class="packt_screen">Data</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1200 image-border" src="assets/8b6791bb-47eb-47cf-9067-7227b134ea2c.png" style="width:15.75em;height:10.50em;"/></p>
<p>If you can't see this on the left-hand side of your screen, you can go to <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> &gt; <span class="packt_screen">Show Side Bar </span>in the menu bar to display it. The pane holds tools that have been separated into three sections: <span class="packt_screen">Summarize</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Model</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Custom</span>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Each of the analytics tools in this toolbar functions in the same manner. You can either double-click the option or drag one of them onto the view, which will make a panel containing a few options appear:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1201 image-border" src="assets/dc97e466-ff6d-4816-9cfa-5da5ecb7e4d4.png" style="width:58.75em;height:26.83em;"/></p>
<p>In general, it will display either three icons (<span class="packt_screen">Table</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Pane</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span>) or only one (when there is no choice to be made), with the exception of <span class="packt_screen">Totals</span>. This will be an indication for Tableau as to which scope the calculation should consider, and you can drop your analytical tool on one of the icons. Taking the example of the <span class="packt_screen">Average line</span> option, dropping it into each icon yields the following three possibilities:</p>
<p>If you select the <strong>Table</strong> icon, you will get the following output:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1202 image-border" src="assets/5b09f312-9b0a-4c74-aac0-c1db41b7c016.png" style="width:35.17em;height:33.58em;"/></p>
<p>If you select the <strong>Pane</strong> icon, you will get the following output:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1203 image-border" src="assets/3991a616-b32a-4440-9b48-9e129578e5b9.png" style="width:33.67em;height:32.25em;"/></p>
<p>If you select the <strong>Cell</strong> option, you will get the following output:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1204 image-border" src="assets/53f374d7-0f37-41b6-a2bd-4d89488e72d3.png" style="width:32.50em;height:31.17em;"/></p>
<p>Whilst the <span class="packt_screen">Table</span> represents the entire view, a <span class="packt_screen">Pane</span> is the part of the view corresponding to an intersection of dimensions in rows and columns that are delimited by a <em>dividing line</em>. For instance, in the preceding examples, there are two panes, one under <span class="packt_screen">APAC</span> and one under <span class="packt_screen">LATAM</span>, as you can see a line between them. The <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span> is the smallest intersection of dimensions and there are eight of them in the previous views.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>These are the same options we discussed in <a href="1f655860-ac26-457f-a78b-f359ccb7d9f0.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Tableau Table Calculations</em>.</span></div>
<p>We can also think about this by saying that the <span class="packt_screen">Table</span> option is akin to a Grand Total and will hold only one value across the visualization; the <span class="packt_screen">Pane</span> option akin to a subtotal across one dimension; and the <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span> option akin to a subtotal at the lowest level possible and will make sense only when there are detail marks available (otherwise, it will just aggregate one value, as is the case here). </p>
<p>Once those analytical tools have been integrated into the view, it's possible to edit or remove them by clicking on their representation and using the relevant options in the tooltip:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205 image-border" src="assets/2ae1a016-91d0-441f-b65f-b73ce2a68ca8.png" style="width:59.08em;height:13.75em;"/></p>
<p>You can also perform the <span class="packt_screen">Remove</span> action by simply dragging and dropping the reference lines off-view, just like you would with any other field.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the <span class="packt_screen">Format</span><span> </span>option on the newly created lines or areas, including colors, fonts, and number formats.</p>
<p>Most of the tools are actually just shortcuts for the options that are available under <span class="packt_screen">Custom</span>, so let's go through those first.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The different line options will create reference lines across your visualization at the scope you have chosen (either at the <span class="packt_screen">Table</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Pane</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Cell</span> level). Once you drop the <span class="packt_screen">Reference Line</span> option onto your visualization, you can use the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> window to switch between two main categories of values:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1206 image-border" src="assets/d9f57de5-de53-483b-88b0-14ffc37b2a1c.png" style="width:30.17em;height:25.92em;"/></p>
<p>Here, you can choose the <span class="packt_screen">Constant</span><span> option, which will display a single line across your representation, or one of several calculated options that will aggregate values at the scope you've chosen. The different possibilities for aggregation are displayed under the </span><span class="packt_screen">Line</span><span> submenu, along with the </span><span class="packt_screen">Constant</span><span> option.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Reference lines are the equivalent of a table calculation, which means the average that's displayed will be the average of marks present in the visualization, not of the underlying data.</div>
<p>Finally, it is also possible to choose a <span class="packt_screen">confidence interval</span> and display it on the view under the same <span class="packt_screen">Line</span> submenu and the label for the line can be customized (either to show the value, the name of the aggregation, or a calculated name, with the respective <span class="packt_screen">Value</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Computation</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Custom</span> options).</p>
<div class="packt_tip">It is also possible to get back to this menu by clicking on an existing reference line and using the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> option in the tooltip.</div>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Constant Line</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Average Line</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Average with 95% CI</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Median with 95% CI</span> options in the <span class="packt_screen">Analytics</span> toolbar are shortcuts to the most common options for lines, but you can always drag and drop them onto the view and edit them later.</p>

<p>A reference band will create two reference lines, as described in the previous section, and will color the space between those two lines with a light color. The <span class="packt_screen">Band From</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Band To</span> options in the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> window are the same as for lines; you can use these to customize and format the upper and lower values of the band. </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding Distribution Bands</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span class="packt_screen">Distribution Bands</span> allow users either to create bands as one or more multiples of a previous aggregate (for instance, 50%, 100%, or 150% of the median) or to create lines or bands based on statistical measures (for instance, percentiles, quantiles, and standard deviation). The resulting bands will be <span><span>tinted </span></span>in different shades of the main color that was chose to represent the intervals between two measures:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1207 image-border" src="assets/1ce9ae08-2adc-4e61-9e42-2c90e893d0de.png" style="width:29.00em;height:16.33em;"/></p>
<p>When using <span class="packt_screen">Percentiles</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> window, users have the option of using one of the selected values (<span class="packt_screen">80</span>, <span class="packt_screen">90</span>, <span class="packt_screen">95</span>, <span class="packt_screen">99</span>) to show the respective percentile lines or using the <span class="packt_screen">Enter One or More Values</span> option:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1208 image-border" src="assets/7016eb7c-852b-4331-877a-9608edd0f646.png" style="width:37.00em;height:30.58em;"/></p>
<p><span>For example, to show the 20th, 60th, and 90th percentiles, select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Enter One or More Values</span><span> from the drop-down menu and enter the percentiles as comma-separated values; for example, </span><kbd>20,60,90</kbd><span>.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you want to create a reference line for a given percentile (for instance, the 90th percentile), you have to use the <span class="packt_screen">Distribution</span> tab with the <span class="packt_screen">Percentiles</span> option using one value, not the <span class="packt_screen">Line</span> tab, as the <span class="packt_screen">Percentiles</span> options are not available there.</div>
<p>For <span class="packt_screen">Quantiles</span>, any value between 3 (terciles) and 10 (deciles) can be used, but all the quantiles will be shown in the view by default. If you wanted to show only a few selected quantiles, use the <span class="packt_screen">Percentile</span> option with the selected calculated values instead (for instance, <kbd>10,50,90</kbd> to show the first, fifth, and ninth deciles only).</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Standard Deviation</span> option creates bands that are multiples of the standard deviation away from the mean. While the most common option is <kbd>-1,1</kbd> to show distribution within one standard deviation from the average (one below, one above), it is possible to specify more complex bands, such as <kbd>-0.5,1,2</kbd>, to show a band from 0.5 standard deviations below the average to one standard deviation above, and a second from one to two standard deviations above in a different shade.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Median with Quartiles</span> option in the <strong>Analytics</strong> toolbar is a shortcut to a common reference band (quartiles, <span class="packt_screen">Quantiles</span> of degree 4), but you can drag and drop the <span class="packt_screen">Distribution Band</span> option onto the visualization to create a custom view of the distribution of data.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Generating box plots</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The box plot diagram (also called box and whiskers) is one of the most widespread statistical visualizations today. The box shows the interquartile range (or <strong>IQR</strong>, that is, the extent of the distribution between the first and third quartiles, also called <strong>hinges</strong>) with a line for the median, while the whiskers show either the full extent of the data or 1.5 times the interquartile range.</p>
<p>This is a very useful tool for depicting variations when you don't want to infer a normal distribution.</p>
<p>It is possible to create a box plot visualization by either dragging it from the <span class="packt_screen">Analytical</span> pane or using the <span class="packt_screen">Show me</span> button to create one:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c79f1a2d-5b25-4d8a-9169-6e8829117676.png" style="width:59.75em;height:39.58em;"/></p>
<p>If the <span class="packt_screen">Box Plot</span> option is grayed out in the toolbox, hovering over it will show what the issue is with the current view (for instance, <span class="packt_screen">not enough marks in the view</span> or <span class="packt_screen">can't be mixed with stacked marks such as bar charts</span>).</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Hovering over the box plot will show the values of the different limits of the box, starting from the bottom: <span class="packt_screen">Lower Whisker</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Lower Hinge</span> (first quartile), <span class="packt_screen">Median</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Upper Hinge</span> (third quartile), and <span class="packt_screen">Upper Whisker</span>.</div>
<p>Using the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> function in the tooltip will, as usual, take you to the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> window, where you will be able to format the box and change the following two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the whiskers should extend to <span class="packt_screen">data within 1.5 the IQR</span> or to the <span class="packt_screen">maximum extent of the data</span></li>
<li>Whether to show or hide the marks that are not outside of the whiskers (outliers) with <span class="packt_screen">Hide underlying marks (except outliers)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've covered the basic analytical tools, you can see that they are actually the four types of visualizations that will be available at the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Edit Reference Line, Band, or Box</span> window when editing any of them:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1209 image-border" src="assets/4025edcf-99bf-4462-abd2-8155a13aeaa0.png" style="width:32.50em;height:9.42em;"/></p>
<p>Adding one of them to the view will let you create any of them by just going to the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> box. We'll continue our review of the different tools that remain in the next section. </p>

<p>There are four options remaining in the Analytics pane: <strong><span class="packt_screen">Totals</span></strong>, <strong><span class="packt_screen">Trend Lines</span></strong>, <strong><span class="packt_screen">Clustering</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="packt_screen">Forecasting</span></strong>. The last of these will be detailed in the next section, so let's focus on the first three.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Totals</span> option can be dragged onto the view to turn on totals either for all the rows, all the columns, or to add subtotals to all the rows or and columns:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1210 image-border" src="assets/6737095f-2fe3-4c1e-b508-c042f94263af.png" style="width:38.92em;height:13.42em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">It is not possible to turn on subtotals for selected dimensions; it has to be done for all or none.</div>
<p>Totals can also be turned on using the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis &gt; Totals</span> options, which can be found in the menu. </p>

<p>Tableau can create the usual <span class="packt_screen">Trend Lines</span> (<span class="packt_screen">Linear</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Logarithmic</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Exponential</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Polynomial</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Power</span>) using the option with the same name in the <span class="packt_screen">Analytics</span> bar and dragging and dropping it onto the view:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e11cf797-20c2-4904-b624-27cc3757ce8a.png" style="width:51.25em;height:7.50em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If the <span class="packt_screen">Trend Line</span> option is not available for selection in the sidebar, this usually is because you need both axes to be measures, or a date and a measure. This will be indicated when hovering over the grayed-out option.</div>
<p>For instance, using the Global Superstore dataset, we can add <kbd>Profit</kbd> to rows, <kbd>Sales</kbd> to columns, <kbd>Order ID</kbd> to <span class="packt_screen">Detail</span> marks, and filtering for orders where <kbd>Order Profitable?</kbd> is <span class="packt_screen">Profitable</span>. Then, we can drop the <span class="packt_screen">Trend Line</span> onto the <span class="packt_screen">Linear</span> icon on the visualization. By doing this, we'll get the following output:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/081eed46-c1ef-484c-ae08-78ed421422cf.png" style="width:59.92em;height:46.92em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_tip">Hovering over the line will show the tooltip with the equation and the <span class="packt_screen">R<sup>2</sup></span> and <span class="packt_screen">P</span> values, which will help you identify whether the trend is relevant or not.</div>
<p>If you need to edit the trend line or change the parameters, you can choose the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> option in the tooltip to go to the <span class="packt_screen">Trend Line Options</span> window.</p>
<p>Now, it's very easy to identify trends with a few clicks, thanks to the power of Tableau.</p>

<p>While the <strong>Clusters</strong> option is not explicitly included in the exam syllabus, it is a valuable tool when we want to create a subdivision of our data. For instance, we can create a map view by including <kbd>Country</kbd> in rows, and <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> as marks, and using the <span class="packt_screen">Show me</span> option to create a quick map. Then, dragging <span class="packt_screen">Clusters</span> onto the view will generate groups of <span>countries based on their levels of sales value and will use them to color code the map. If we want to modify these parameters, we can click on the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Clusters</span> <span>pill in</span> <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span><span> and select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Edit Clusters</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/020ea57f-a23c-4779-9f6d-af4a26e3de60.png" style="width:43.50em;height:31.00em;"/></p>
<p>Then, we can add other variables to be included in the computation of the clusters and we can define a fixed number of clusters, rather than keep an automated number.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For more information on how Tableau creates clusters, please refer to the <em>How Clustering Works</em> link in the <em>Further reading</em> section of this chapter.</div>
<p>When a cluster has been created, it is possible to drag its pill from the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> section into <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> to transform it into a group. You will notice the icon is slightly different from the usual group icon (a combination of the cluster icon and a paperclip), and that is to signify that this group is not static and can be refitted using the <span class="packt_screen">Refit</span> option. This means it can be updated with the latest data if the scope has changed.</p>

<p>While the <strong>Summary Card</strong> is not part of the <span class="packt_screen">Analytics</span> pane, it's a useful tool if you want to get a quick glance at the statistical properties of your dataset.</p>
<p>It can be turned on by using <span class="packt_screen">Worksheet &gt; Show Summary</span> in the menu. It will appear in the <strong>Cards</strong> section, below where the filters are when they are shown:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2a9970d5-d258-4c6d-856e-44edbd5b4b9c.png" style="width:12.42em;height:21.00em;"/></p>
<p>By default, it will show the total number of marks and the <span class="packt_screen">Sum</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Average</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Minimum</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Maximum</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Median</span> for each measure. While using the drop-down menu in the card, you can select an additional set of calculations, including <span class="packt_screen">Standard Deviation</span>, <span class="packt_screen">First</span>, and <span><span class="packt_screen">Third quartiles</span>.</span><span> </span></p>
<p>It is important to remember that the results in this card are similar to table calculations: the median that's shown here is the median of the marks, not of the underlying data.</p>
<p>This wraps up our review of the basic analytical tools that are included with Tableau. There is one final tool to review, which we will do in the next section.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using forecasting</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While the previous tools were only performing analytics on existing data, the <span class="packt_screen">Forecast</span> option allows us to extrapolate the data to get a glimpse into the future.</p>
<p>By default, Tableau includes a package that takes the best of a few options of models to create a simple forecast. Tableau uses an exponential smoothing model, which gives more weight to the recent data points over the older ones. Those forecasts can then be fine-tuned with the use of the options that can be found in the <span class="packt_screen">Edit Forecast</span> toolbox.</p>
<p>To start using forecasts, simply drag and drop the <span class="packt_screen">Forecast</span> option from the Analytics bar onto a chart or table that includes one and only one date field (otherwise, you will see a message indicating that no forecast can be created for views with multiple date fields). You can also use the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis &gt; Forecast &gt; Show Forecast</span> menu to achieve the same result. Tableau will then create a best-guess forecast with automatic options, including a confidence range for a given period (based on how much past data is available). </p>
<p>For instance, using <kbd>Order Date</kbd> as columns (<span class="packt_screen">Month</span>) and <kbd>Sales</kbd> as rows, we can drop the <strong>Forecast</strong> option onto the view:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/459ea5eb-afbf-4e1d-8a15-82eea5e81152.png" style="width:63.83em;height:36.75em;"/></p>
<p>This will create a new color scheme so that we can differentiate between actual and estimated data, and a thick arrow will appear next to the <strong>Sales</strong> pill to confirm that the forecast is turned on. If you need to edit the forecast, you can use the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> function in the tooltip when clicking on the forecast or use the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis &gt; Forecast &gt; Forecast Options...</span> menu.</p>
<p>For basic users of this function and for the purpose of this exam, the only options that would be of interest are the <span class="packt_screen">Forecast Length</span> (if you want to be able to manipulate it) and the <span class="packt_screen">Ignore last</span> options, which are helpful when there are incomplete periods at the back of some data. Advanced users can use the <strong>Learn more about forecast options</strong> link to get a deeper understanding of what the different options can bring.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you ever run into an issue where the forecast cannot be added (or where it doesn't appear), it is possible to hover over the <span class="packt_screen">Forecast</span> option in the <strong>Analytical</strong> pane (or over the <span class="packt_screen">No forecast</span> label on the view, respectively) to learn more about why a forecast cannot be generated.</div>
<div>
<p>This concludes our review of the different analytical tools that Tableau has to offer. Before we end this chapter, let's look at an example.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">A practical example</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now that we know all about Tableau's analytical tools, let's see whether we can solve this sample exam question:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">Which subcategories in the LATAM market are more than a standard deviation away from the mean for both sales and profit?</div>
<p>We can answer this question in two ways.</p>
<p>First, we can go with the previous chapter and use <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> statements to show the average and standard deviation of the sum of the two measures. Here, we will define <kbd>{INCLUDE [Sub-Category]: SUM([Profit])}</kbd> and <kbd>{INCLUDE [Sub-Category]: SUM([Sales])}</kbd> and look at the average and standard deviation of each, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fd393348-83ea-48f9-befb-a12a9186e0b9.png" style="width:34.92em;height:42.08em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>By performing some simple additions, we can get the lower and upper bounds (for example, <span class="packt_screen">$13,038</span> + <span class="packt_screen">$14,161</span> = <span class="packt_screen">$27,199</span> as the upper bound for profit and <span class="packt_screen">$127,330</span>-<span class="packt_screen">$111,886</span> = <span class="packt_screen">$15,444</span> as the lower bound for sales). Subsequently, we can plot <kbd>Sales</kbd> and <kbd>Profit</kbd> by <kbd>Sub-category</kbd> and get to the answer. </span><span>But it's easy to overlook one of the subcategories </span>when scanning down.</p>
<p>Instead, we can try to make the most of the <span class="packt_screen">Analytics</span> pane. We can plot <kbd>Sales</kbd> and <kbd>Profit</kbd> along the rows and columns and use <kbd>Sub-Category</kbd> as <span class="packt_screen">Detail</span> marks:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4c4689ab-6134-4879-a5a2-639eb20f61d4.png" style="width:45.67em;height:37.42em;"/></p>
<p>Now, we can drag and drop a <span class="packt_screen">Distribution</span> band on the <span class="packt_screen">Table</span> for both measures. Rather than the default <span class="packt_screen">60, 80% of Average</span>, we can click <span class="packt_screen">Standard Deviation</span> and keep the proposed <span class="packt_screen">-1,1</span> factors, which means one standard deviation both below and above the mean:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1211 image-border" src="assets/50ec1a8c-d1df-4f57-882f-bea25482de7a.png" style="width:40.08em;height:27.92em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_tip">Note that you will probably need to adjust one of the bands as Tableau handles them one at a time and the second one will still show the default <span class="packt_screen">60, 80% of Average</span>. To do so, click on one of the defining lines of the band and use <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> in the tooltip.</div>
<p>Now, we have a shaded area that represents the distribution within one standard deviation from the mean:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1212 image-border" src="assets/e4454262-ddc8-43ed-b86c-a0323ae9ae5b.png" style="width:49.67em;height:41.92em;"/></p>
<p>Due to this, it's easy to spot the three subcategories in the top-right corner that are outside both and get their names by hovering over the mark, if necessary <span>on </span><span class="packt_screen">Chairs</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Phones</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Copiers</span>.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we covered some of Tableau's analytic tools, which allow us to create reference lines or bands, cluster data in similar buckets, identify trends, and forecast what our data will look like in the future. This allows us to highlight some of the useful information that might have been missing from the views (such as an average line or maybe a constant band to tell us when a project started and finished), and this helps bring meaningful insight to our data.</p>
<p>This chapter concludes our exploration of worksheets, for which we now have all the tools required for the exam. We will study how to link and present different worksheets in a single consolidated view using dashboards in the next and last chapter of this book.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions to test your knowledge of the information in this chapter. </p>
<p>Q: Using the Global Superstore dataset, if you create a forecast for <kbd>Sales</kbd> by <kbd>Year</kbd>, how many periods forward does Tableau forecast by default?</p>
<p>A: Two periods (with <kbd>Year(Order Date)</kbd> as columns and <kbd>SUM(Sales)</kbd> as rows, and dragging the <span class="packt_screen">Forecast</span> option).</p>
<p>Q: How can you create a single line for the 90th percentile on a view?</p>
<p>A: By adding a <span class="packt_screen">Distribution Band</span>, with <span class="packt_screen">Percentile</span>, <span class="packt_screen">90</span> as options, not by adding a <span class="packt_screen">Reference Line</span>, as there are no options for percentiles.</p>
<p>Q: Using t<span>he Global Superstore dataset, which country in Central Asia has the widest distribution of profits, using interquartile ranges?</span></p>
<p>A: Creating a box plot, as described in this chapter, India is the country with the widest IQR (represented by the size of the box).</p>
