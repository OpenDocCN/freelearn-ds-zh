<p>GIS has the amazing capability to help us solve real-world problems. ArcGIS Pro includes a wealth of tools that allow users to perform all kinds of analysis to answer questions, find solutions, and determine patterns. However, like most computer systems, the results are only as good as the quality of the data the analysis is based on. The old adage <em>garbage in, garbage out</em> definitely applies.  </p>
<p>So how do we ensure our GIS data is clean and accurate? One way is to make use of topology. Topology is a model of how features are related to one another spatially. Are they adjacent, connected, or coincident? This should not be confused with topography, which is how the ground changes in elevation. ArcGIS Pro allows you to use two types of topology, Geodatabase and Map.</p>
<p>A geodatabase topology is an item you create within a geodatabase, which allows you to apply rules to the data that is part of the topology. This might include rules such as: polygons must not overlap, lines must not intersect, or points must be inside a polygon. The rules are then used to validate the data to locate any features that violate the rules. ArcGIS Pro includes tools that allow you to fix the errors that are found. To make use of geodatabase topologies, you must store your data in a geodatabase, the feature classes must be in the same feature dataset, and you must have a standard or advanced license.  </p>
<p>In addition to being able to validate data with geodatabase topology, ArcGIS Pro provides tools to help you edit data so as to not introduce new errors into your data. These topology edits allow you to edit multiple features so that whatever their existing spatial relationship happens to be, it is maintained after the edit. This can not only keep your data clean, but also greatly increases your editing efficiency because you can edit multiple features with a single edit operation.</p>
<p>Map topologies are not as complex as geodatabase topologies. They are temporary, only existing during a given ArcGIS Pro session when you have a map open. Map topologies do not allow you to validate your data to find errors. What they allow you to do is perform edits to existing data, using topology edit tools, so that the edited features maintain their current spatial relationships.</p>
<p>Map topologies are not limited to only data in a geodatabase or in a single-feature dataset. Geodatabase feature classes and shapefiles can all be included in a single Map topology. Another advantage of the Map topology is that it works at all licensing levels, so you can use them even with just a Basic license.     </p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to create a new Geodatabase topology. This will include adding rules and feature classes to it. Then you will validate the feature classes that take part in the topology to find the errors. Next you will use topology tools to fix the errors and validate again to ensure your edits have not introduced new errors. Lastly, you will explore a Map topology and how you can use it to edit multiple features at one time.  </p>

<p>A geodatabase topology is an item stored in a geodatabase, just like a feature class or table. They can only exist and function within a geodatabase. Other formats, such as shapefiles, do not support geodatabase topologies.</p>
<p>Like feature classes and tables, you must create the topology. This will include giving it a name, setting tolerances, adding rules, and adding participating feature classes. To create a new geodatabase topology, a couple of things must be true.</p>
<p>First, you can only create a geodatabase topology within a feature dataset. Second, only feature classes stored in the feature dataset containing the topology can participate in that topology. Third, participating feature classes must not<span> be </span>part of another topology or geometric network. A feature class can only participate in one topology or geometric network at a time. Lastly, you must have a Standard or Advanced license of ArcGIS Pro in order to create a new topology.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a new geodatabase topology in the Trippville GIS database, which will ultimately be used to validate the parcel data for the City. For those that have done this in the older ArcMap application, you will find the ArcGIS Pro process much more complex, at least in version 2.0 and version 2.1. This will hopefully be more streamlined in future versions.  </p>

<ol>
<li>To get started, you need to launch ArcGIS Pro as you have in previous recipes. </li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro</span> start window, click on <span class="packt_screen">Open another project</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-857 image-border" height="417" src="assets/df964c45-8a5b-4dd9-9c48-cd968cf05e19.png" width="584"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Computer</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Open</span> window and then click <span class="packt_screen">Browse</span> in the area on the right.</li>
<li>Navigate to <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter5\Topologies</kbd> by clicking on <kbd>C:\</kbd> in the area on the left of the <span class="packt_screen">Open Project</span> window. Then double-click on <span class="packt_screen">Student</span>, <span class="packt_screen">ArcGISProCookbook</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Chapter5</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Topologies</span> folders.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Topologies.aprx</span> project file and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The project will open in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> view. This project currently does not contain any maps. Before you create your new topology, you need to verify a couple of things first. You need to ensure that your geodatabase contains a feature dataset and that the parcels feature class, which you will validate later, is within a feature dataset:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/13909805-1fdf-415f-b8f4-4b6eb87ed52b.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, click on <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> so that the two geodatabases connected to the project are displayed in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> view.</li>
<li>Double click on the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS.gbd</span> geodatabase so you can see its contents. Then answer the question ahead:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does the geodatabase contain any feature databases, and if so, what are they?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should have seen that this geodatabase contains at least three feature datasets, Base, Sewer, and Water. So that means you can create a topology in this geodatabase. Now you need to locate the parcels feature class:</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Double-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Base</span> feature dataset to reveal its contents.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>Scroll down to verify that it contains the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> feature class.</li>
<li>Scroll back through the feature dataset to see if it contains any topologies. Then answer the questions ahead:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong><span>: </span>Is the Parcels feature class within the feature dataset?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><span>: </span>Does the feature dataset contain any other topologies?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you have verified that the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> feature class is stored in the <span class="packt_screen">Base</span> feature dataset, and there are no other topologies to contend with, you are now ready to begin building a new topology.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Toolboxes</span> tab near the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane, just below the search cell, as shown in the following screenshot. This will open all the system toolboxes connected to the project:</li>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>For those that have used the older ArcMap or ArcCatalog applications, this is the same as opening ArcToolbox. ArcGIS Pro does not include separate applications like the older ArcGIS Desktop did. In ArcGIS Pro, everything is all in one single application, at least up to version 2.1. There has been some discussion about creating an ArcCatalog-like app for performing general data management functions. However, it has not been determined if this will indeed happen.</p>

<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Browse</span> button located at the end of the cell for the <span class="packt_screen">Input Feature Dataset</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> in the panel on the left of the <span class="packt_screen">Input Feature Dataset</span> window that opened. You may need to expand the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> folder to see it.</li>
<li>Double-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS.gdb</span> geodatabase in order to display its contents.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Base</span> feature dataset and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>. <em>Do not double-click on the feature dataset</em>. Select it with a single click.</li>
<li>For the <span class="packt_screen">Output Topology</span>, type <kbd>Parcels</kbd>. This is the name of the topology you are creating. Leave the <span class="packt_screen">Cluster Tolerance</span> blank. ArcGIS Pro will calculate a default tolerance.</li>

<div class="packt_tip">
<p>The Cluster Tolerance is the distance at which ArcGIS Pro believes features should be considered to be in the same location. When you validate the topology, ArcGIS Pro will automatically snap features together that are within the cluster tolerance distance. This means that when you validate, it will potentially move data. This is both good and bad. It will often clean up data by connecting features that were mistakenly not connected. It will remove small gaps and overlaps between features. However, if your cluster tolerance is set to large, it could snap features together that should not be. So, it is generally recommended to keep the cluster tolerance small. Esri indicates that the best practice is to use the default tolerance calculated by ArcGIS Pro, as it is typically small enough to avoid any adverse effects to your data.</p>

<p>You have just created a new topology in the previous recipe. This will allow you to find errors in the parcel feature class which violate the polygons must not overlap rule you included in the topology. To find any errors you must first validate the topology.</p>
<p>When you validate a topology, several things occur. First, all features participating within the topology are snapped together if they are within the cluster tolerance. This is done automatically for all features when you validate. Second, the participating feature classes are checked against the rules you have included in the topology. Any areas that include features that violate the rules are identified in the topology so you can easily locate the errors and fix them.  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will validate your topology to identify any errors in the Parcels feature class. To do this, you will create a new map and add the topology, along with the Parcels layer, to it.    </p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, a topology includes more than just the rules, participating feature classes, and cluster tolerance. It also includes the located errors and Dirty Areas:</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Turn on the <span class="packt_screen">Dirty Areas</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels Topology</span>. You should see a big blue square appear around the parcels in the map, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><strong><img height="388" src="assets/61ca4a4a-a108-4af8-b0ec-00c5af7576f5.png" width="645"/></strong></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Topology dirty areas displayed in the map</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Dirty Areas are areas in your data that are participating in the topology which you have not validated. In this case, the entire area is considered a dirty area because you have not validated your topology. Just because a dirty area exists does not mean your data has errors or cannot be used. A Dirty Area is just an area within your data which you have not validated with the rules in your topology because you have either edited the data or just created the topology. Regardless of whether Dirty Areas exist, or if your data does have errors, you can always use your data.</p>
</div>
<ol start="15">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>

<li>Click on the drop-down arrow located next to <span class="packt_screen">No Topology</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Edit</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab, and select <span class="packt_screen">Parcels (Geodatabase)</span> from the list, as illustrated:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><strong><img src="assets/f687e6fe-43f0-433f-b034-df78c40e157c.png"/></strong></div>
<ol start="17">
<li>Now that you have selected the topology you will validate, you need to access the validate tool. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Modify</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Modify Features</span> pane.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <span class="packt_screen">Topographic</span> toolset. If necessary, expand it so you can see its contents.</li>
<li>Since this is the first time you have validated the topology since it was created, select the <span class="packt_screen">Validate All</span> tool.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>There are also geoprocessing tools you can use to validate your topology. These are located in the <span class="packt_screen">Data Management</span> toolbox and the <span class="packt_screen">Topology</span> toolset. The <span class="packt_screen">Validate Topology</span> tool does the same thing as the <span class="packt_screen">Validate All</span> tool.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When you validate the topology, it will look for any parcels that overlap other parcels. Any it finds, it will add those locations to the <span class="packt_screen">Polygon Errors</span> layer. When the validation is complete, you should see some red polygons on the east side of the Parcels layer, which indicate the errors that were found.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Modify Features</span> pane and save your project.</li>
<li>Zoom in to the area indicated in the following diagram:</li>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Zoom to the area indicated by the rectangle</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your map should now look similar to the following diagram. Remember your colors may be different as ArcGIS Pro assigns a random color to new layers when they are added:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">In this view, you can see the errors that were found in the parcel data once you verified it.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Let’s create a bookmark so you can easily return to this area later. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Bookmarks</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Navigate</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab. Select <span class="packt_screen">New Bookmark</span>. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Create Bookmark</span> window.</li>
<li>Name the new bookmark <kbd>Parcels Overlap Area to Fix</kbd> and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
<li>Save your project.</li>
<li>If you are not continuing to the next recipe, you may close ArcGIS Pro. Otherwise keep it open.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you have seen in previous recipes, bookmarks allow you to quickly zoom in to a fixed spatial location. These are very handy for many purposes. Several things I use bookmarks for include printing a map at a specific location and scale, for meetings where I need to highlight specific areas or features, and to return to a specific location for a project or for editing. Each map has its own set of bookmarks. There is no limit to the number of bookmarks a project can contain.   </p>

<p>Now that you know where the errors are in your data, you need to fix them. ArcGIS Pro includes specific tools for fixing topology errors. These are generally quick and easy to use for most situations. You may also use standard editing tools to correct errors as well. In either case, you should always validate your data after completing edits to ensure you have not introduced any new errors into your data.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will fix several errors you uncovered when validating the topology. You will use the Error Inspector tool in ArcGIS Pro to correct the errors.</p>

<li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro before starting this recipe, you will need to start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>Topologies.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter5\Topologies</kbd> using the skills you have learned in past recipes.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, click on the <span class="packt_screen">List by Editing</span> button.</li>
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer is enabled for editing.</li>

</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Ensure the following layers at minimum are selectable: <span class="packt_screen">Polygon Errors</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Error Inspector</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Edits</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Error Inspector</span> pane at the bottom of the interface. Like all panes, this one may be undocked and moved to a different location if desired.</li>
<li>Select the first error presented in the pane by clicking on the gray square located to the far left of the first row, as illustrated here:</li>
</ol>

<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Zoom To</span> option located at the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Error Inspector</span> pane. This will zoom you in to the location of the selected error.</li>
<li>Right-click on the same square you clicked on to select the error to reveal a new context menu. Select <span class="packt_screen">Merge</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-862 image-border" height="260" src="assets/57afdb9c-a07c-41d6-bac3-cdd0c792a68a.png" width="332"/></strong></div>

<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Parcels 24884 (Largest)</span> and click the <span class="packt_screen">Merge</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Merge</span> window that appears. This will merge the overlap area with the selected parcel and subtract it from the smaller parcel you did not select, removing the overlap.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">For the sake of this recipe, we chose to merge the overlapping area with the larger parcel polygon for the sake of expediency. Normally you would want to do some research to see which parcel the area should belong to.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>When you right-clicked on the row, in the table, a context menu appears. This menu contains many options. The top section of the context menu allows you to navigate to the location of the error. The second section allows you to review the rule the error has violated. The third section contains tools for correcting the error. The tools will vary based on the rule which has been violated and the type of data you are working with.</p>
<p>In this case you had three tools to choose from to fix the error: Remove Overlap, Merge, and Create Feature. You saw how the Merge tool worked, but what about the others? The Remove Overlay will remove the area where two or more polygons overlap one another. This creates a gap between the polygons. The Create Feature tool creates a new polygon from the overlapping area while subtracting that same area from the overlapping polygons.</p>
</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>A new dirty area should appear because you just edited the parcels layer but have not validated it. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Validate</span> button located at the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Error Inspector</span> pane. This will remove the dirty area and allow you to see if any new errors have appeared due to your edit.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>You should validate your data regularly when using topologies to ensure it remains clean. How often you validate is up to you, but here are some general guidelines: beginner users should probably validate after every edit or correction. More experienced users should validate before they save edits to ensure they are not saving erroneous data back to the geodatabase. Remember, you can always undo up until the last time you saved. Once you save, there is no going back.</p>

</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li>Click on each error, one at a time. Watch both the map and the <span class="packt_screen">Preview</span> window at the right side of the <span class="packt_screen">Error Inspector</span> pane. You should be able to see that each of these errors is related to the same two parcels.</li>

</ol>
<p>As you have now seen, the use of geodatabase topologies can greatly increase the overall accuracy of your GIS data and help you locate where errors may exist. The end result is improved data quality and better analysis results. One thing to remember when you want to use geodatabase topologies is you must have a Standard or Advanced ArcGIS Pro license. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>You have now seen how powerful geodatabase topologies can be to help you find and correct errors in your data. However, to use geodatabase topologies, your data must be stored in a geodatabase and you must have a standard or advanced license. So, what do you do if you want to maintain data which is stored in a shapefile so that you do not introduce topological errors, or if you only have a basic license? This is where a Map topology should be used.</p>
<p>As said in the introduction, map topologies are temporary and do not allow you to validate data using rules. What they do allow you to do, though, is edit data using topology tools so that the existing spatial relationships are maintained. This keeps you from introducing any new errors into your data. Map topologies also have the advantage of allowing these topology editing tools to be used on shapefiles and geodatabase feature class-based layers at the same time. Being able to edit multiple layers with single edits, regardless of whether it is a shapefile or geodatabase, can greatly increase your efficiency. Map topologies also do not require all the geodatabase feature classes to be in the same feature dataset within the geodatabase. So, while map topologies do not allow you to validate your data like geodatabase topologies do, they do offer greater data flexibility.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will use a map topology to edit data in multiple layers with a single edit. A road has been widened to include a turn lane. You need to adjust several layers including, the City Limits, Parcels, Rights of Way, and Voting Districts, to reflect the newly widened road. Several of these layers are in the Trippville GIS geodatabase you have been working with. However, the Voting Districts are stored in a shapefile because the voter registration system, which needs the layer, cannot read a geodatabase.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">Your map should now show the new area for the new turn lane that was installed, as shown in the following diagram. This new turn lane required you to edit multiple layers. This included all the layers which were in your map. You could have edited each layer individually. However, by using the Map Topology, you were able to edit features in four different layers with a single edit. This included layers which were stored in different data formats as well.</p>

<ol start="37">
<li>Once you verify <span>that </span>your edits were completed successfully, save your edits by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Edits</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">Remember, saving data edits is different than saving a project. By default, these are two separate operations. Saving the project will save changes you have made to the contents of the project, such as adding a new map, changing the properties of a layer in a map, creating a new layout, and connecting to a new database. Saving the project is done using buttons or commands on the Quick Access Toolbar or the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> tab in the ribbon.  The <span><span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Edits</span> group saves changes to the spatial or attribute data referenced in a map or scene. It does not save edits to the project. In the options for ArcGIS Pro, you can enable the saving of edits when you save the project, if desired. Doing so is not a bad idea for new users who are not accustomed to having different saves within a single application. </span></div>
<ol start="38">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Modify Features</span> pane to free up screen area and reduce the computer resources being used by ArcGIS Pro.</li>
<li>Save your project to ensure all your project changes are saved.</li>
<li>Close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have now seen the power of Map topology. It allows you to edit multiple features at one time, regardless of which layer or layers they may be in, as long as they are coincident. This can greatly increase the efficiency of your editing. Unlike Geodatabase topologies, you can use Map topologies in any license level of ArcGIS Pro. The primary limitation of a Map topology is the inability to assign spatial rules and validate your data using the rules, as you can with a Geodatabase topology. </p>
