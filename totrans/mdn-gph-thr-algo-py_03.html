<h1 id="_idParaDest-17" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>What is a Network?</h1>
<p class="calibre3">This chapter introduces the basics of graph theory and its applications in network science. Network science is not a commonly taught area of data science, but many problems can be framed through a network science perspective. Network-based algorithms often scale better than other machine learning algorithms, making them ideal for analyzing datasets with many variables, exploring spatial datasets with many locations represented, or spotting trends in high-dimensional time series data. Later chapters will delve more deeply into the topics with hands-on examples.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will define terms that will be used throughout the book, explore some common uses of network science in analyzing social relationship data, and introduce two Python packages that will be used in subsequent chapters. After finishing this chapter, you’ll start to recognize data science problems that can be formulated as network science problems and how to represent them visually in Python.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Formally, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Introduction to graph theory and networks</li>
<li class="calibre11">Examples of real-world social networks</li>

<p class="calibre3">We have very few technical requirements or assumptions for this chapter. If you have not installed Python, you are encouraged to do so, as we will be using Python regularly—specifically, the Jupyter Notebooks that are installed with the Anaconda version of Python installation. If you have difficulty with installation, support can be found on Stack Overflow.

<h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Introduction to graph theory and networks</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Social connections are fundamental to society, including family ties, shared roles in communities, trading relationships, and many more. Social networks—from MySpace to Twitter to TikTok—have played a larger and larger role in marketing, job-hunting, and information sharing in the last decades. Software systems might even be built between engineers scattered across the globe collaborating on platforms such as GitHub or Slack to coordinate efforts from teams in Kenya, India, and Australia who have never met.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A branch of data science called <strong class="bold">network science </strong>studies these relationships<a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> between individuals, groups, and even societies within social networks using algorithms and statistical methods originating in a field of math called <strong class="bold">graph theory</strong>. Graph theory studies pairwise<a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> relationships between objects. Graph objects (including people, towns, ideas, points in time, and many more types of objects to study) are represented in network science as vertices, or points, within the network; note that some<a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> disciplines may use<a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> the term “<em class="italic">node</em>” instead of “<em class="italic">vertex</em>.” Relationships between objects (such as mutual collaborations between people or bridges connecting different islands or statistical connections between time points) are represented as edges within the network and connect pairs of vertices that share a relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To make this a little more concrete, let’s consider three young women: Ayanda in South Africa, Machiko in Japan, and Greta in Belgium:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.1 – Ayanda, Machiko, and Greta" src="img/B21087_01_01.jpg" class="calibre4"/>

<p class="calibre3">Perhaps Ayanda, Machiko, and Greta join an online women’s coding hackathon aimed at sustainable energy solutions. Through the hackathon, they meet and form a team to work on solar power solutions for rural villages. They’ve formed a professional network with mutual relationships among the three women, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.2</em>:</p>

<p class="calibre3">As these women work on their<a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> hackathon project, Ayanda<a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> may invite colleagues within her social network, adding to the team and creating new connections for Machiko and Greta over time. Perhaps Amara, a colleague of Ayanda’s from Kenya, connects with Greta but not Machiko to code the backend of their project, adding another member to the network:</p>

<p class="calibre3">The evolution of networks over time is a key problem in network science today, as we often have incomplete data on relationships that exist outside of what we explicitly observe and want to predict future phenomena, such as predicting the potential for bipartisan fake news spread in the next election or when new members may join a criminal organization based on ties that exist in the present. We will wrangle some problems related to dynamic social networks and their applications in <a href="B21087_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor097" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, where we analyze the spread of disease over time as a social network evolves.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Before jumping into real-world problems<a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> and their solutions in Python, it’s important<a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> to understand the fundamentals of network science. Let’s dive into some of the terminology and conventions of graph theory and networks.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Formal definitions</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Real-world networks are usually<a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> formalized and studied with tools from graph theory. As we’ve mentioned, graph theory defines relationships between objects in the form of vertices and the edges that connect related vertices. Let’s formalize this a bit and explore the foundations of network science found in graph theory. A graph is defined as a set of vertices and a set of lines, or edges, that connect pairs of vertices (Berge, 2001). Thus, a graph represents the structure of a network well. Returning to our hackathon social network, we represent our colleagues as vertices and connect them with edges if they collaborate.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Graphs can represent<a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> different types of relationships. A self-relationship of a vertex can be shown with a loop connecting the vertex to itself. For instance, when writing emails, someone might copy themselves on the email or send an email to themselves as a reminder. Another type of relationship is directionality. For instance, reposting content is a unidirectional interaction (usually), but friending someone is a bidirectional interaction where both parties mutually connect. Unidirectional relationships are represented in a graph with directed edges, usually denoted with an arrow on visualizations of the graph. Bidirectional relationships have undirected edges, denoted as lines without arrows. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows a graph with loops, directed edges, and undirected edges:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – A graph with loops, directed edges, and undirected edges</p>
<p class="calibre3">In scientific literature, the terms network and graph are used interchangeably, as are terms for edges<a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> and vertices. <em class="italic">Table 1.1</em> shows a few of the common<a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> terms encountered:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 1.1 – A terminology comparison between network science and graph theory</p>
<p class="calibre3">In practice, these distinctions<a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> are rarely made, so these<a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> two terminologies are often synonyms of each other. In this book, we’ll stick with <em class="italic">edges</em> and <em class="italic">vertices</em> as our graph components and networks as our preferred term for the collection of vertices and edges created from real-world data.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Many types of graphs exist within graph theory that are realized in real-world data. Let’s briefly define some types of graphs that exist:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">A directed graph contains one or more edges<a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> with a direction (to or from<a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> another vertex, called arcs)</li>
<li class="calibre11">An undirected graph only has edges, which<a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> do not have an origin or destination vertex</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">“A graph is simple if it has no multiple lines (typically used to represent multiple relationships that exist or denote the strength of a relationship).”</em> A simple undirected graph <a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>contains no loops, but a simple directed graph<a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> can contain loops. Let’s visualize what these graphs look like in practice:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5 – (a) A directed graph, (b) simple graph, and (c) simple directed graph bottom</p>
<p class="calibre3">We can define vertices and their connecting edges or arcs based on data to create a network for visualization or analysis in Python. In the next section, we’ll introduce some packages in Python that will be used throughout the book to create and study networks in practice.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Creating networks in Python</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we know<a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> a little bit about<a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> networks, let’s explore how they are created with two Python packages commonly used in network science: <code>igraph</code> and <code>NetworkX</code>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">igraph is a network science software available in C, R, and Python. igraph provides many network science tools, including network creation options, many network analytics algorithms, and network visualization plots. Let’s explore igraph network creation and visualization using our hackathon network:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre11">First, let’s install <strong class="source-inline1">igraph</strong>:<pre class="source-code">
#install igraph and pycairo
!pip install igraph
!pip install pycairo</pre></li> <li class="calibre11">We’ll then import <strong class="source-inline1">igraph</strong> and its <strong class="source-inline1">Graph</strong> module:<pre class="source-code">
#import igraph
import igraph as ig
from igraph import Graph</pre></li> <li class="calibre11">Next, we’ll use the <strong class="source-inline1">Graph</strong> module to create a graph with three vertices with undirected edges connecting each vertex with the remaining vertices:<pre class="source-code">
#create hackathon network
g_colleagues=ig.Graph(
    edges=[(0,1),(0,2),(1,2)],n=3,directed=False)</pre></li> <li class="calibre11">Now, we can use<a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> the <strong class="source-inline1">plot</strong> function to visualize our hackathon<a id="_idIndexMarker022" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> network. igraph offers many customization options, including vertex color, vertex size, edge color, edge size, labeling of vertices, and the size of the plot (among others). For this plot, we’ll bound the size of the image and create vertices large enough to label with the first initials of our hackathon network members:<pre class="source-code">
#plot the hackathon network
ig.plot(g_colleagues,bbox= (200,200), vertex_size=40,
    vertex_label=["M","A","G"])</pre><p class="calibre3">This should give you a plot that looks like <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, showing <em class="italic">Machiko</em>, <em class="italic">Greta</em>, and <em class="italic">Ayanda’s</em> hackathon network:</p></li> </ol>

</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – A plot of the hackathon network in igraph</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now let’s repeat our network<a id="_idIndexMarker023" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> creation in NetworkX. NetworkX <a id="_idIndexMarker024" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>contains much of the functionality of igraph but provides easier integration with other network science tools and platforms, as well as simple ways to explore differential equations on networks:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre11">Let’s first install <strong class="source-inline1">NetworkX</strong>:<pre class="source-code">
#install NetworkX
!pip install NetworkX</pre></li> <li class="calibre11">Now, let’s import <strong class="source-inline1">NetworkX</strong>:<pre class="source-code">
#import NetworkX
import networkx as nx</pre></li> <li class="calibre11">NetworkX works a bit differently than igraph in the construction of a network. We first define an empty graph, fill in the vertices, and then define what edges exist:<pre class="source-code">
#create hackathon network
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from([1, 3])
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])</pre></li> <li class="calibre11">We’ll need to add attributes (our network member initials), import <strong class="source-inline1">matplotlib</strong>, and then plot our graph:<pre class="source-code">
#plot the hackathon network
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
G.nodes[1]['initial'] = 'M'
G.nodes[2]['initial'] = 'A'
G.nodes[3]['initial'] = 'G'
labels = nx.get_node_attributes(G, 'initial')
nx.draw(G, labels=labels, font_weight='bold')</pre><p class="calibre3">This should show a plot similar<a id="_idIndexMarker025" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> in structure but a bit different<a id="_idIndexMarker026" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> in style to the one we constructed in igraph:</p></li> </ol>

</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – A NetworkX plot of our hackathon network</p>
<p class="calibre3">We’ll be using both igraph and NetworkX in the coming chapters to show examples in both packages. For some problems, igraph will have better functionality; for others, NetworkX is preferable. In practice, you’ll encounter both as you implement network science<a id="_idIndexMarker027" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> on real-world<a id="_idIndexMarker028" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> problems. In the next sections, we’ll overview different network types and problems, laying the foundation for our future chapters.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Random graphs</h2>
<p class="calibre3">As network science began<a id="_idIndexMarker029" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> to tackle more and more real-world problems, understanding processes of network growth became an avenue of research:</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Was edge-building </em><em class="italic">purely random?</em></p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Were there limits to the number of edges that any vertex might cultivate given the number </em><em class="italic">of vertices?</em></p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Did vertices with many edges tend to encourage edges among unconnected vertices that shared an edge with a particular </em><em class="italic">well-connected vertex?</em></p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Did vertices and edges separate into well-connected groups that didn’t connect well with </em><em class="italic">other groups?</em></p>
<p class="calibre3">A few growth process models gave rise to common types of growth patterns that are useful in network science research. Some of these, such as <strong class="bold">Erdös-Renyi networks</strong>, serve as comparisons for organized<a id="_idIndexMarker030" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> development in real-world networks. Erdös-Renyi networks are random networks, where edges between vertices are created probabilistically between any pair of vertices. For instance, to create a network with many edges, we might set the probability of vertex pair connections to 70%. To create a network with few edges, we might set the probability of vertex pair connections to 10%. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.8 (a)</em> shows an Erdös-Renyi network with edge connection probability of 70%; <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.8 (b)</em> shows an Erdös-Renyi network with edge connection probability of 10%:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.8 – Erdös-Renyi networks with edge probabilities of (a) 70% and (b) 10%" src="img/B21087_01_08.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – Erdös-Renyi networks with edge probabilities of (a) 70% and (b) 10%</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the real world, preferential <a id="_idIndexMarker031" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>attachment, where some vertices attract connections to other vertices, is a more realistic model of how edges are added between vertices. One of the best-known examples<a id="_idIndexMarker032" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> of preferential attachment is the <strong class="bold">Barabasi-Albert model</strong>, where networks form more connections around certain vertices.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In a real-world example of preferential attachment, let’s consider a frontend engineer searching social media for backend engineers who are potential collaborators. Thus, the frontend engineer’s connections would not be random. They will be cultivated based on the engineer’s specific needs and the results of a search for backend engineers. <strong class="bold">Scale-free networks</strong> are models of this preference for attachment<a id="_idIndexMarker033" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> that often happens in real-world network formation processes. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.9</em> shows the frontend engineer’s social network after adding the needed connections, who may not know each other before connecting with the frontend engineer:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.9 – A scale-free network of engineering connections cultivated by the frontend engineer’s search of social media" src="img/B21087_01_09.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.9 – A scale-free network of engineering connections cultivated by the frontend engineer’s search of social media</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the major criticisms<a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> of scale-free models of network formation is the lack of hubs, or regions with high connectivity between a set of vertices and relatively few connections with other sets of vertices. <strong class="bold">Watts-Strogatz models</strong> account for this tendency<a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> to form denser regions of connections. As an example, gene networks often form clusters of related genes that influence each other functionally; some gene clusters also influence other gene clusters, forming occasional connections between gene sets with high connectivity, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.10</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.10 – A network of related genes" src="img/B21087_01_10.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.10 – A network of related genes</p>
<p class="calibre3">Recent research has shown that none of these random network models capture all the nuances that come with real networks. Many real networks have aspects of preferential attachment and aspects of dense clustering, as well as some random connections that would not be expected given what is known about the network. Friends of friends often meet. Individuals find others who share their interests by searching social networks or connecting to a friend’s other social groups. Some friendships randomly start when individuals are stuck in an elevator or on a ferry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we have explored<a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> how to create networks in Python, let’s turn back to some real-world examples of networks, including directed and undirected networks and networks that change structure over time.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-23" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor023" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Examples of real-world social networks</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Real-world networks are often<a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> more complicated than the examples we’ve considered. Let’s consider some nuances in social media networks. In the simplest forms, a social network contains mutual connections between friends at a single point in time. However, some friends may interact more often on the social media platform than others; they may comment on posts, reshare content, and message each other frequently. Weighted networks assign numerical values to edges in a network according to some measurement of relationship strength or frequency of interactions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s return to our hackathon<a id="_idIndexMarker038" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> network and weight our edges based on the average number of conversations per day of the hackathon between different team members. Perhaps <em class="italic">Machiko</em> is coordinating the business use case of the technology and does not interact much with <em class="italic">Ayanda</em>, the backend engineer, but needs to make sure the front end is intuitive (<em class="italic">Greta’s</em> team position). However, we’d expect <em class="italic">Ayanda</em> and <em class="italic">Greta</em> to work together more frequently, as they are integrating the backend and front end of the product. Perhaps we have a weighted network as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.11</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.11 – A weighted hackathon network of conversations between team members" src="img/B21087_01_11.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.11 – A weighted hackathon network of conversations between team members</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition to weighting, relationships can be undirected or directed. So far, we’ve considered undirected networks, where relationships are mutual. Friendships, Zoom calls, shared classes, team membership, and many other real-world networks involve mutual relationships. However, messages are one-way interactions, between a sender and receiver. Reposts of social media content are one-way relationships, as well. Gene regulation, population migration, airline flights, and goods transportation also involve one-way interactions. Directed graphs allow us to capture directional information in our graph, and like undirected graphs, directed graphs can be weighted or unweighted.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s consider a football game<a id="_idIndexMarker039" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> where the players pass a ball to each other over a 5-minute period. Perhaps one forward dribbles for a while and then passes the ball to the other forward, who quickly passes it to the open center striker. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.12</em> shows this weighted network of football field interactions among the teammates:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.12 – A network of ﻿football teammates passing to each other over a 5-minute period" src="img/B21087_01_12.jpg" class="calibre4"/>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.12 – A network of football teammates passing to each other over a 5-minute period</p>
<p class="calibre3">Networks are rarely static. Consider a group of friends graduating from university. Some will stay in touch over the next several years; some will lose contact. The strength of lasting friendships may change, as well. Those who stay in the same area where they went to university might strengthen their friendships as they enter the workforce. Those who move away may connect with others in their new location and start losing touch with friends in other areas. Let’s consider four close friends graduating from university in Cape Town to pursue different careers in different cities:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.14 – The university friendship network a decade after graduation</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.14</em> shows that one friend (in the upper-right corner) has lost touch with all but one close university friend. One friend (lower-left corner) has maintained all her close university friendships. This change may seem rather trivial, as all friends have maintained at least one friend from the original group. However, in terms of information exchange across the network, the original friendship network was more amenable to information exchange from the friend in the upper-right corner to the others in the network. She could communicate directly with each friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, after a decade of drifting friendships, information exchange from the friend at the top right must go through the friend at the bottom left to reach the rest of the network. The time taken for important news (perhaps regarding a reunion or wedding) to reach the full network will be longer in the network in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.14</em> than in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.13</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we’ve introduced a few types <a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>of social networks. We’ve seen how relationships can be mutual or one-sided. We’ve seen how networks can change over time and how this may impact information exchange on networks. We’ll revisit social relationships in <em class="italic">Chapters 2, 3, 8</em>, and <em class="italic">9</em>. Now, let’s explore some other types of problems that can be formulated as networks.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-24" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor024" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Other type of networks</h1>
<p class="calibre3">So far, we’ve mainly considered<a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> social networks. However, objects and their relationships can be defined on a much broader range of problems. Network science provides useful tools for understanding spatial data. For instance, consider a region with several small island towns connected by a series of bridges that allow goods and people to travel from region to region. During an epidemic, it might be useful to know which routes to close to minimize the spread of disease from one town to another. However, cutting off routes entirely would leave some areas without necessary supplies, such as food or medicine. Tools we’ll consider in later chapters can help regions plan the optimal routing of goods and minimize the potential spread of an epidemic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We might also consider a map of stores, each with differing sale volumes of citrus fruit. Stores could be connected into a network based on shared management across stores, based on similarity of citrus fruit sales patterns, or based on geography (within the same county or country, for instance). How we define our network will impact what insight we can gain about regional citrus fruit sales and factors that might be impacting those sales patterns. We’ll explore this use case more in <a href="B21087_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Similarly, we can wrangle time series data into networks and use network science tools to gain insight into patterns over time. For example, consider daily financial data across the tech, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. We can consider weekly correlations among the sectors and build a weighted network with edges defined by correlation values and track network properties over the weeks that exist in our data to pinpoint changes that might signal a coming market crash. Correlation networks among stocks and financial sectors are well studied, and we’ll return to this example in <a href="B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sometimes, we have spatiotemporal data, where our data has spatial and time series components. Consider the price of grain across several urban markets across a country. Pricing will vary across markets, with influences of local supply and demand, regulations in certain regions of the country, and local salaries likely influencing the price of grain at a specific market. Proximity to other markets and influences over time (such as the conflict in Ukraine limiting grain supplies globally) also influence pricing. By creating a series of networks based on geography, time period, and some of these other aforementioned factors, we can understand which markets tend to behave similarly with respect to grain price, which areas might be most vulnerable to price increases, and which areas might be most vulnerable to supply chain issues. This could allow an aid organization to pivot food aid more quickly to areas where people are unlikely to be able to afford future grain prices or may lose access to grain altogether. We’ll tackle this problem in <a href="B21087_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we have seen some use cases<a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> in spatial and temporal data, let’s turn to some more advanced problems in data science that can be formulated in terms of network science, including neural network architectures and language ontologies.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-25" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor025" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Advanced use cases of network science</h1>
<p class="calibre3">The tools of network science<a id="_idIndexMarker044" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> extend beyond social networks, spatial data, and temporal data. Deep learning models are ubiquitous in data science today, solving problems in computer vision, natural language processing, time series forecasting, and generative artificial intelligence. <strong class="bold">Large language models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>) and text-to-image generators<a id="_idIndexMarker045" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> rely on a type of deep<a id="_idIndexMarker046" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> learning architecture called transformer models, feed-forward neural networks that find patterns<a id="_idIndexMarker047" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> in data by embedding input data, tuning attention weights, and decoding the data with respect to the outcome. These models can have billions or even trillions of parameters to tune across many connected layers. When combined with pre-trained <strong class="bold">contrastive language-image pre-training</strong> (<strong class="bold">CLIP</strong>) models, transformer models such<a id="_idIndexMarker048" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> as DALL-E can even generate realistic images based on text input. For instance, inputting <em class="italic">hyperdetailed photorealistic king cobra, background desert market</em> into NightCafe’s DALL-E algorithm produced the image in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.15</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.15 – NightCafe’s DALL-E output image for the prompt “hyperdetailed photorealistic king cobra, background desert market.” " src="img/B21087_01_15.jpg" class="calibre4"/>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.15 – NightCafe’s DALL-E output image for the prompt “hyperdetailed photorealistic king cobra, background desert market.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, given the size of deep learning<a id="_idIndexMarker049" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> models such as transformer models (or the convolutional neural networks often used to classify images), understanding connections across layers is critical to building good initial models that won’t require as much tuning and is helpful in tuning architectures based on network properties.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Additionally, networks themselves may be modeled through a special class of deep learning<a id="_idIndexMarker050" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> algorithms, called graph neural networks, that take networks as input data and build regression or classification models based on some output. For instance, say we want to understand which networks are most vulnerable to the spread of fake news; in the 2014 and 2018 Ebola outbreaks, fake news regarding public health measures and virus sources hindered public health efforts and resulted in a greater loss of life, as well as some violent attacks on treatment centers. We may have a few hundred networks that we have studied and classified as high, medium, or low risk based on network properties and simulations of fake news spread on these networks, but we want to assess several hundred thousand scraped real-world networks collected from social media sites around the world. We can train a graph neural network on our classified data and apply it to the much wider collection of scraped networks to classify their fake news risks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides neural networks, many other advanced uses of networks exist, including in the mapping of ontologies. Ontologies organize relationships between objects, such as semantic relationships between words, regulatory relationships between genes, or symptoms shared between diseases. Often, multiple ontologies exist, such as the organization of consumer goods across store chains. Mapping one ontology to another provides a way to combine information from each ontology into a single entity. Given that each ontology exists as its own network being mapped onto other ontologies, the problem can be simplified to network<a id="_idIndexMarker051" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> mapping. We’ll explore this in more depth later in the book.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-26" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor026" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we explored different types of networks, introduced two network packages in Python, examined different theoretical models of network growth and their limitations, and considered several examples of networks not based on social relationships. We also touched on some more advanced topics in network science today, including network applications to deep learning, network classification, and ontology mapping. In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into igraph and NetworkX with practical network examples.</p>
