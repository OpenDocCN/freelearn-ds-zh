- en: If you are asked about the top five hot topics in today's IT world, Big Data
    will be one of them. In fact, Big Data is a broad buzzword that encompasses a
    lot of components, and NoSQL database is an indispensable component of it.

- en: Cassandra is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. Nowadays, it offers a
    vast number of technological advantages that enable you to break through the limits
    of a traditional relational database in a web-scale or cloud environment. However,
    designing a high-performance Cassandra data model is not an intuitive task, especially
    for those of you who have been so involved with relational data modeling for many
    years. It is too easy to adopt a suboptimal way to simply mimick a relational
    data model in Cassandra.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is about how to design a better model that leverages the superb scalability
    and flexibility that Cassandra provides. Cassandra data modeling will help you
    understand and learn the best practices to unleash the power of Cassandra to the
    greatest extent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting with a quick introduction to Cassandra, we will guide you step-by-step
    from the fundamental data modeling approach, selecting data types, designing data
    model, and choosing suitable keys and indexes to a real-world application by applying
    these best practices.

- en: Although the application is small and rudimentary, you will be involved in the
    full development life cycle. You will go through the design considerations of
    how to come up with a flexible and sustainable data model for a stock market technical-analysis
    application written in Python. Business changes continually and so does a data
    model. You will also learn the techniques of evolving a data model in order to
    address the new business requirements.

    evolving of the data model, performance tuning, and system monitoring, which are
    also supplemented at your fingertips.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Bird''s Eye View of Cassandra"), *Bird''s
    Eye View of Cassandra*, explains what Big Data and NoSQL are and how they are
    related to Cassandra. Then, it introduces the important Cassandra architectural
    components and the features that come along with them. This chapter lays the fundamental
    knowledge, concepts, and capabilities that all the following chapters refer to.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Cassandra Data Modeling"), *Cassandra Data
    Modeling*, explains why data modeling using Cassandra is so different from the
    relational data modeling approach. The commonly used technique in making a Cassandra
    data model, modeling by query, is explained with ample examples in more detail.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. CQL Data Types"), *CQL Data Types*, walks
    you through the Cassandra built-in data types, with many examples that compose
    of a data model. The internal physical storage of these data types is also provided
    in order to help you understand and visualize what is going on in Cassandra.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Indexes"), *Indexes*, discusses the design
    of the primary and secondary indexes. Cassandra data model is based on the queries
    to be used in order to access them. Primary and secondary indexes are different
    from those with the same names in a relational model, which often causes confusion
    to many new Cassandra data modelers. This chapter clearly explains when and which
    of them can be used correctly.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. First-cut Design and Implementation"), *First-cut
    Design and Implementation*, conducts the design of the data model for a simple
    stock market technical-analysis application. This chapter starts by defining the
    business problem to be solved, the functions to be provided, and proceeds to design
    the data model and the programs. By the end of this chapter, the technical-analysis
    application can run on Cassandra to provide real functions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Enhancing a Version"), *Enhancing a Version*,
    describes a number of enhancements on the technical-analysis application built
    in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. First-cut Design and Implementation"), *First-cut
    Design and Implementation*. The enhancements involve both data model and code
    changes. This chapter illustrates how Cassandra''s data model can flexibly embrace
    the changes.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Deployment and Monitoring"), *Deployment
    and Monitoring*, discusses several important considerations to migrate an application
    on Cassandra from a non-production environment to a production one. The considerations
    include replication strategy, data migration, system monitoring, and basic performance
    tuning. This chapter highlights these pertinent factors in a real-life production
    Cassandra cluster deployment.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Final Thoughts"), *Final Thoughts*, supplements
    additional topics in application development with Cassandra, such as client drivers
    that are available for different programming languages, built-in security features,
    backup, and restore. It also recommends a few useful websites for further information.
    Finally, a quick review of all the chapters wraps up the book.'
