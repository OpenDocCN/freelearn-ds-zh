- en: If you are asked about the top five hot topics in today's IT world, Big Data
    will be one of them. In fact, Big Data is a broad buzzword that encompasses a
    lot of components, and NoSQL database is an indispensable component of it.

  zh: 如果你被问到当今IT世界的五大热门话题，大数据将是其中之一。实际上，大数据是一个广泛的流行词汇，涵盖了众多组件，而NoSQL数据库是其不可或缺的组成部分。
- en: Cassandra is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. Nowadays, it offers a
    vast number of technological advantages that enable you to break through the limits
    of a traditional relational database in a web-scale or cloud environment. However,
    designing a high-performance Cassandra data model is not an intuitive task, especially
    for those of you who have been so involved with relational data modeling for many
    years. It is too easy to adopt a suboptimal way to simply mimick a relational
    data model in Cassandra.

  zh: 卡桑德拉是最受欢迎的NoSQL数据库之一。如今，它提供了大量的技术优势，使你能够在Web规模或云环境中突破传统关系型数据库的限制。然而，设计高性能的卡桑德拉数据模型并不是一个直观的任务，尤其是对于那些多年来一直参与关系型数据建模的人来说。在卡桑德拉中简单地模仿关系型数据模型很容易采取次优的方法。
- en: This book is about how to design a better model that leverages the superb scalability
    and flexibility that Cassandra provides. Cassandra data modeling will help you
    understand and learn the best practices to unleash the power of Cassandra to the
    greatest extent.
