- en: There are several powerful Python libraries for reading, processing, analyzing,
    and viewing geospatial data. There are also a number of websites that provide
    high-quality geospatial data, which you can use freely in your own projects. This
    data will often be the basis for your analysis, providing the shapes of countries,
    the positions of cities, the outlines of roads, and so on. Using this data in
    conjunction with the available geospatial libraries gives you a powerful toolkit
    for performing your own geospatial analysis using Python.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Geospatial Analysis and Techniques"), *Geospatial
    Analysis and Techniques*, walks the reader through the process of downloading
    sample geospatial data, before writing a simple Python program to read and analyze
    that sample data.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Geospatial Data"), *Geospatial Data*, focuses
    on the data used for geospatial analysis: how to obtain it, why good data is important,
    the different formats that geospatial data can come in, and how to generate your
    own spatial datasets.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Spatial Databases"), *Spatial Databases*,
    provides a brief introduction to creating geospatial databases, how to store data
    in a spatially-enabled database, and how to perform efficient queries against
    that data.'

    Data*, guides the reader through the process of writing spatial analysis programs
    using Python. Based on the datasets downloaded in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Geospatial
    Data"), *Geospatial Data*, and using the major Python libraries for geospatial
    analysis, this chapter uses a recipe-like format to solve a range of typical spatial
    analysis problems.'

    *Building a Complete Geospatial Analysis System*, uses all the various libraries
    and techniques covered in the earlier chapters to build a complete geospatial
    analysis system.'

    geospatial programming, or have specific spatial programming needs, then this
    book is for you. While familiarity with installing third-party Python libraries
    will be an advantage, no prior knowledge of geospatial programming concepts or
