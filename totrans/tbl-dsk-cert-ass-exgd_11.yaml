- en: In the previous three chapters, we learned how to create increasingly more complex
    calculations in Tableau. Now that we have the tools to develop powerful workbooks,
    let's see if we can leverage Tableau's analytics capabilities to bring some color
    to our data, either with graphical elements, such as reference lines or bands,
    or using forecasting to predict future data.

    corresponding to an intersection of dimensions in rows and columns that are delimited
    by a *dividing line*. For instance, in the preceding examples, there are two panes,
    one under APAC and one under LATAM, as you can see a line between them. The Cell
    is the smallest intersection of dimensions and there are eight of them in the
    previous views.

    Forecast option allows us to extrapolate the data to get a glimpse into the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, Tableau includes a package that takes the best of a few options
    of models to create a simple forecast. Tableau uses an exponential smoothing model,
    which gives more weight to the recent data points over the older ones. Those forecasts
    can then be fine-tuned with the use of the options that can be found in the Edit
    Forecast toolbox.

    Analytics bar onto a chart or table that includes one and only one date field
    (otherwise, you will see a message indicating that no forecast can be created
    for views with multiple date fields). You can also use the Analysis > Forecast
    > Show Forecast menu to achieve the same result. Tableau will then create a best-guess

- en: In this chapter, we covered some of Tableau's analytic tools, which allow us
    to create reference lines or bands, cluster data in similar buckets, identify
    trends, and forecast what our data will look like in the future. This allows us
    to highlight some of the useful information that might have been missing from
    the views (such as an average line or maybe a constant band to tell us when a
    project started and finished), and this helps bring meaningful insight to our
    data.

    all the tools required for the exam. We will study how to link and present different
    worksheets in a single consolidated view using dashboards in the next and last
    chapter of this book.
