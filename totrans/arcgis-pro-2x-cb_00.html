<p>ArcGIS Pro is Esri's newest desktop GIS application with powerful tools for visualizing, maintaining, and analyzing data. ArcGIS Pro makes use of the modern ribbon interface and 64-bit processing to increase the speed and efficiency of GIS. It allows users to create amazing maps in both 2D and 3D quickly and easily.</p>
<p>If you want to gain a thorough understanding of how ArcGIS Pro can be used to perform various types of geospatial analysis, how to work with various data formats, and how to share your ArcGIS Pro results via ArcGIS Online, then this book is for you.</p>
<p>Beginning with a refresher on ArcGIS Pro and how to work with projects, this book will quickly take you through recipes on using various data formats supported within the application. You will learn the limits of each format such as Shapefiles, Geodatabase, and CAD files, and see how to convert the data to the format that best suites your needs. Next, you will learn how to link tables from outside sources to existing GIS data to expand the amount of data that can be used in ArcGIS Pro. From there, you will dive into ways to edit 2D and 3D data using ArcGIS Pro and understand how topology can be used to ensure data integrity. We will explore different analysis tools that allow us to perform both 2D and 3D analysis. Lastly, the book will show how data and maps can be shared via ArcGIS Online and used with web and mobile applications. This book will also introduce you to ArcGIS Arcade, Esri's new expression language, which is supported across the entire ArcGIS platform. </p>
