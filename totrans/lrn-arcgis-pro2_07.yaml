    first introduced the concept of managing your **Geographic Information System**
    (**GIS**) using project files with their **ArcView** **GIS** application. ArcView
    GIS used projects to manage map layouts, views, tables, data connections, and
    more all within a single `.apr` file. This allowed us to access everything associated
    with a project from a single location.'

- en: When Esri released ArcGIS in 1999, the previously described method was dropped.
    In its place, Esri decided to use separate files called **map documents** (`.mxd`
    files) for **ArcMap**. A map document contains a single map with one or more data
    frames. So, for each map you need, you will have to create a separate map document.
    If you also had to create 3D maps, you would need another separate file called
    a scene (`.sxd`). All of this means you often have tens to hundreds of files to
    manage and keep track of, which makes management much harder.
  prefs: []

- en: '**ArcGIS Pro projects** greatly simplify GIS management. Now, projects allow
    you to consolidate all of the resources needed to complete a project in a single
    place. So, this chapter will help you learn that you no longer need to search
    for the correct map document. You just need to open the ArcGIS Pro project file
    for the project that you are interested in and all the maps, data connections,
    layouts, tools, and more will appear there. This chapter will also help you to
    locate services much faster. Also, after completing this chapter, you will be
    able to create your own project and templates.'

    that others who are not in your organization will access your templates. When
    you create and save a template to ArcGIS Online, you are asked about who you wish
    to share the template with. If you select everyone, then you will be sharing your
    template with any users that have access to ArcGIS Online. That includes those
    who are not part of your organization. This means ArcGIS Pro users who are not
    affiliated with your company or group will be able to use your template. This
    also means they will be able to see everything you included in the template, such
    as database connections, logos, folder connections, layouts, and more. Access
    to your templates could represent a security breach waiting to happen if you are
    not careful. So, when you save a template to ArcGIS Online, make sure to pay attention
    to who you choose to share it with.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating custom templates using ArcGIS Pro, there is something you should
    know that happens if your template references data or folders that are located
    on mapped drives. A **mapped drive** is one that is referred to by a drive letter,
    such as the `C:` drive, which is normally the local drive on your computer, or
    the `M:` drive, which is located on a network file server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While using ArcGIS Pro, it is preferred that you don't use mapped drives, especially
    when creating templates. It's preferred that you use a **Universal Naming Convention**
    (**UNC**) path. *So, what is a UNC path?* This is what IT people use to connect
    mapped drive letters to a folder on their server. A UNC path looks something like
    `\\GIS_Server\GIS_Data_folder`. `GIS_Server` is the name or IP address for the
    server on your network. `GIS_Data_Folder` is a share created by the server administrator
    on that server to allow others on the network to access the files contained within
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ArcGIS Pro's preference for UNC paths makes sense for data that resides on a
    server because it is not uncommon for different people in an office to use different
    drive letters to reference the same location on a server. For example, I might
    have `\\GIS_Server\GIS_Data_folder` mapped to the `M:` drive because I think GIS
    is mapping, so I think it makes sense to map the GIS data to the `M:` drive. However,
    my colleague may map the same server location to the `G:` drive for GIS. However,
    if I used the UNC path instead, it would be the same location for both of us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*So, what happens if you create a template that references mapped drives?*
    Well, when you create a new project based on the template, ArcGIS Pro will actually
    create copies of your data. It does this without any warning and unless you look
    closely at your layer sources, you will not notice that this has happened. To
    learn more about this, visit [https://youtu.be/tyu439Uownk](https://youtu.be/tyu439Uownk).'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you learned how important projects are when using ArcGIS Pro.
    They are the very core of the application. You have seen how they contain all
    the items associated with a project, including database connections, maps, styles,
    toolboxes, layouts, server connections, and more. By having all of these in a
    project, it is much easier to access the resources that you will need to perform
    GIS work in ArcGIS Pro.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You now know how to create new projects using the Esri-provided templates, as
    well as custom ones that you can create. Once you create a project, you also know
    how to add new resources to the project so that you are able to perform the required
    GIS functions to complete tasks. As you have seen, a project is not limited to
    a single database, map, folder, or style. You can choose to make as many connections
    as you wish so that you are able to access whatever datasets, tools, and symbology
    that you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because a single project can contain multiple connections and other items, it
    is important to manage all the items included in the project to ensure the project
    runs effectively and provides access to the most relevant data. The Catalog pane
    in ArcGIS Pro provides the tools and methods to access, add, view, or remove those
    resources. This will ensure the project performs efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, you learned how a project template can be used to make creating new
    projects more efficient by preconfiguring various project items. You have the
    option to use one of the predefined ArcGIS Pro templates, or you can create your
    own custom templates.
