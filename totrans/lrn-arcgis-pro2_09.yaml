    of the user. This can be especially true for those who work out in the field.
    Large maps are unwieldy and become difficult to use. Smaller maps are oftenunable
    to clearly display the detailed level of data required when out in the field.

    for the area you need to display. ArcGIS Pro has built-in functionality for creating
    these map books called **Map Series**. For those who have used the older **ArcMap**
    application, **Map Series** provides the same basic functionality as **Data Driven

    can contain multiple maps, scenes, or layouts. As you will learn later, the Map
    Series functionality is linked to a layout. So, each layout, in theory, could
    be turned into a map series. We will look at steps to create a map series in this

    series. You still need to consider the audience, purpose, and situation. Like
    a traditional layout, these three considerations will guide you to create your
    map series. They will help you determine which layers should be included, how
    much detail is needed, and what size you need to make the pages in the series,
    which will also impact the scale that you can use to display the data.

    later in this chapter.

    basic process that you use to create a traditional single map layout, but with
    a few minor differences.

    will be based on several factors, such as whether the map series will end up being
    in a bound booklet or report. If so, *what side will the binding be located?*

    examples of the things that can impact the overall design of your layout.

    you should also be considering the scale at which you want your map series to
    be displayed and printed. This can be a single scale for all pages in the series,
    or it can be variable based on your index.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want the series to use a variable scale based on each index feature,
    you will have two options. The first will be to scale each page so that the index
    feature defining that page fits in the map frame area of the layout. This is the
    easiest method, but it means that you will not know the exact scale of each page
    in the series.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second option is to use a field in the attribute table of the index layer
    that contains the specified scale values for each index feature. This provides
    you with exact scales that you know. The downside is that you must determine the
    scale for each individual index feature and page.

    This starts with opening the layout that you want to use for the series. Then,

    If you are attempting to highlight specific features located in a single layer,
    then an irregular index based on that single layer would most likely be the best
    option. If you are trying to create a map series for a project located along a
    road or utility transmission line, then a **strip index** would most likely be
    the best choice. If you are trying to create a map series that will cover the

    Which one you should use depends on the purpose of the map series that you are

    indexes. These are found in the Cartography toolbox and the Map Series toolset.
    You can now use an index that defines the location and area for the pages that
    will be included in the series that you create.
