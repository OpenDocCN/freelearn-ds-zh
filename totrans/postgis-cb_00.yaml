    property crimes in my city for the last three months? What is the shortest route
    from my home to my office? What route should I prescribe for my company's delivery
    truck to maximize equipment utilization and minimize fuel consumption? Where should
    the next fire station be built to minimize response times?

- en: People ask these questions, and others like them, every day all over this planet.
    Answering these questions requires a mechanism capable of thinking in two or more
    dimensions. Historically, desktop GIS applications were the only ones capable
    of answering these questions. This method—though completely functional—is not
    viable for the average person; most people do not need all the functionalities
    that these applications can offer, or they do not know how to use them. In addition,
    more and more location-based services offer the specific features that people
    use and are accessible even from their smartphones. Clearly, the massification
    of these services requires the support of a robust backend platform to process
    a large number of geographical operations.

    are required or desired, most developers have opted to adopt spatial databases
    as their support platform. There are several spatial database software available,
    some proprietary and others open source. PostGIS is an open source spatial database
    software available, and probably the most accessible of all spatial database software.

- en: PostGIS runs as an extension to provide spatial capabilities to PostgreSQL databases.
    In this capacity, PostGIS permits the inclusion of spatial data alongside data
    typically found in a database. By having all the data together, questions such
    as "What is the rank of all the police stations, after taking into account the
    distance for each response time?" are possible. New or enhanced capabilities are
    possible by building upon the core functions provided by PostGIS and the inherent
    extensibility of PostgreSQL. Furthermore, this book also includes an invitation
    to include location privacy protection mechanisms in new GIS applications and
    in location-based services so that users feel respected and not necessarily at
    risk for sharing their information, especially information as sensitive as their
    whereabouts.

    their spatial problems using PostGIS. These problems can be as simple as finding
    the nearest restaurant to a specific location, or as complex as finding the shortest
    and/or most efficient route from point A to point B.
