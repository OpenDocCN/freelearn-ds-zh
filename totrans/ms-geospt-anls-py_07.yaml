    Geospatial Databases*, you learned how to install PostGIS, create a table, add
    data, and perform basic spatial queries. In this chapter, you will learn how to
    work with geospatial databases to answer questions and make maps. This chapter
    will have you load crime data into tables. Once you have populated your geodatabase
    with real-world data, you will learn how to perform common crime analysis tasks.
    You will learn how to map queries, query by date ranges, and perform basic geoprocessing
    tasks such as buffers, point in polygon, and nearest neighbor. You will learn
    how to add widgets to your Jupyter Notebooks to allow queries to be interactive.
    Lastly, you will learn how to use Python to create charts from your geospatial
    queries. As a crime analyst, you will make maps, but not all GIS-related tasks
    are map-based. Analysts use GIS data to answer questions and create reports. Executives
    are often more familiar with charts and graphs.
