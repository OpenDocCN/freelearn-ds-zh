    the number of vertices directly connected to the vertex of interest. Many Laplacian-based
    metrics or algorithms depend on the degree matrix within algorithm calculations.
    On the surface, this metric seems to capture important hub properties; a vertex
    with a high degree centrality will carry a lot of influence within the network
    (and, thus, might make a good intervention target). It also scales well to very
    large networks. However, one limitation of degree centrality is its lack of awareness
    of a vertex’s position beyond any immediate connections to neighbors; a vertex
    with a low degree centrality may be connected to many vertices with a high degree
    centrality, giving it more influence over network behavior and structure than
    its degree centrality suggests.

    areas of a graph with a low probability, create an adjusted adjacency matrix that
    is connected. This adjusted adjacency matrix is then scaled before performing
    the eigen decomposition on the adjusted adjacency matrix, which is carried out
    to compute eigenvector centrality scores. PageRank centrality scores, thus, provide
    flexibility. In addition, this computation is typically easier and faster with
    the adjusted adjacency matrix, allowing the algorithm to scale well to networks
    of even hundreds of millions of vertices.

    a grid search, windowing tends to be more of an art than a science. Choosing a
    window impacts the length of time in which trends can be captured. In our stock
    market data, window length limits the period in which we can search for trends
    and, thus, limits the time period after the last window in which we can forecast
    market behavior. A window that is too large can miss important trends that impact

    network metrics to a time series problem on NASDAQ stock data from 2004 to 2020
    to investigate how network metrics and time series thresholding impact the ability
    to extract useful information from time series data, such as our stock data. Finally,
    we investigated extending networks to simplicial complexes and constructed a network
    by building two simplicial complexes using the Vietoris–Rips method and various
    threshold values. In [*Chapter 7*](B21087_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088), we'll look
