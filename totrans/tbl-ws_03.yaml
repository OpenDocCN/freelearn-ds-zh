    Prep. You will learn how to use various Tableau Prep options to clean datasets,
    join different data sources using various options, and perform data manipulation
    activities such as pivots, grouping, and aggregations. By the end of this chapter,
    you will be able to export a cleaned data source to develop visualizations in
    Tableau.

    such as joins, filtering, and groups using Tableau Desktop. However, Tableau Desktop
    only performs basic data manipulation. It may not be able to handle raw unprocessed/unclean
    data, like data containing multiple entries, missing entries, or inconsistent
    formats. Now, you will learn about more advanced methods, better suited to these
    trickier scenarios.

    so we can use the data for our visualizations. It consists of advanced algorithms
    that help detect data inconsistencies and fix them. This can be done automatically
    as well as manually, depending on the requirements.

    cleaning, splitting, adding pivots, joining data sources, and applying unions.
    Finally, you will learn how to export this transformed dataset into Excel for
    data visualization.

    vertically. A union is performed when instead of joining, you just want to append
    the data below another data that has similar columns. A very common example of
    union is when you have two tables containing similar columns but maintained separately
    to represent different years. For example, you may want to combine order information
    for multiple years into a consolidated dataset.

    comparative analysis through visualizations. You also saw how to merge mismatched
    column names. Next, you will learn about the script step. Note that this is not
    used very often as it is a very advanced step in which complex statistical programs
    are required to run on the input using R or Python scripts. Therefore, this will
    be a purely theoretical discussion.
