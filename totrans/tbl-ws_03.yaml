    Prep. You will learn how to use various Tableau Prep options to clean datasets,
    join different data sources using various options, and perform data manipulation
    activities such as pivots, grouping, and aggregations. By the end of this chapter,
    you will be able to export a cleaned data source to develop visualizations in
    Tableau.

- en: In the previous chapter, you performed some fundamental data transformations
    such as joins, filtering, and groups using Tableau Desktop. However, Tableau Desktop
    only performs basic data manipulation. It may not be able to handle raw unprocessed/unclean
    data, like data containing multiple entries, missing entries, or inconsistent
    formats. Now, you will learn about more advanced methods, better suited to these
    trickier scenarios.

- en: Tableau Prep is a tool specifically designed to perform data transformation
    so we can use the data for our visualizations. It consists of advanced algorithms
    that help detect data inconsistencies and fix them. This can be done automatically
    as well as manually, depending on the requirements.

    like adding data sources, data profiling, and applying transformations such as
    cleaning, splitting, adding pivots, joining data sources, and applying unions.
    Finally, you will learn how to export this transformed dataset into Excel for
    data visualization.

    frequency, the number of unique records, and the associations among various columns.
