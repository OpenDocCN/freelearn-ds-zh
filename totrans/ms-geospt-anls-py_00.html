<p>Over time, Python has become the programming language of choice for spatial analysis, resulting in many packages that read, convert, analyze, and visualize spatial data. With so many packages available, it made sense to create a reference book for students and experienced professionals containing essential geospatial Python libraries for Python 3.</p>
<p>This book also comes at an exciting moment: new technology is transforming how people work with geospatial data – IoT, machine learning, and data science are areas where geospatial data is used constantly. This explains the inclusion of new Python libraries, such as CARTOframes and MapboxGL, and Jupyter is included as well, to explore these new trends. At the same time, web and cloud-based GIS is increasingly becoming the new standard. This is reflected in the chapters of the second part of this book, where interactive geospatial web maps and REST APIs are introduced.</p>
<p>These newer libraries are combined with a number of older ones that have become essential over the years, and are still very popular to this day, such as Shapely, Rasterio, and GeoPandas. Readers who are new to this field will be given a proper introduction to popular libraries, putting them into perspective and comparing their syntax through code examples using real-world data.</p>
<p>Finally, this books marks the transition from Python 2 to 3.x. All of the libraries covered in this book were written in Python 3.x so that the readers can access all of them using Jupyter Notebook, which is also the recommended Python coding environment for this book.</p>

<p>This book is for anyone who works with location information and Python. Students, developers, and geospatial professionals can all use this reference book, as it covers GIS data management, analysis techniques, and code libraries built with Python 3.</p>

<p>As this book covers Python, it is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of the Python language, can install Python libraries, and knows how to write and run Python scripts. As for additional knowledge, the first six chapters can easily be understood without any previous knowledge of geospatial data analysis. However, later chapters assume some knowledge of spatial databases, big data platforms, data science, web APIs, and Python web frameworks.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "Select a folder and save the key, which will now have a <kbd>.ppk</kbd> file extension."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">cursor.execute("SELECT * from art_pieces")<br/>data=cursor.fetchall()<br/>data</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>from pymapd import connect<br/>connection = connect(user="mapd", password= "{password}", <br/>     host="{my.host.com}", dbname="mapd")<br/><strong>cursor = connection.cursor()</strong><br/>sql_statement = """SELECT name FROM county;"""<br/><strong>cursor.execute(sql_statement)</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>conda install -c conda-forge geos</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "To generate the pair from the EC2 Dashboard, select Key Pairs from the NETWORK &amp; SECURITY group in the left panel after scrolling down."</p>
