- en: 'It is estimated that in 2013 the whole world produced around 4.4 zettabytes
    of data; that is, 4.4 *billion* terabytes! By 2020, we (as the human race) are
    expected to produce ten times that. With data getting larger literally by the
    second, and given the growing appetite for making sense out of it, in 2004 Google
    employees Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat published the seminal paper *MapReduce:
    Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters*. Since then, technologies leveraging
    the concept started growing very quickly with Apache Hadoop initially being the
    most popular. It ultimately created a Hadoop ecosystem that included abstraction
    layers such as Pig, Hive, and Mahout – all leveraging this simple concept of map
    and reduce.'

- en: However, even though capable of chewing through petabytes of data daily, MapReduce
    is a fairly restricted programming framework. Also, most of the tasks require
    reading and writing to disk. Seeing these drawbacks, in 2009 Matei Zaharia started
    working on Spark as part of his PhD. Spark was first released in 2012\. Even though
    Spark is based on the same MapReduce concept, its advanced ways of dealing with
    data and organizing tasks make it 100x faster than Hadoop (for in-memory computations).

- en: In this book, we will guide you through the latest incarnation of Apache Spark
    using Python. We will show you how to read structured and unstructured data, how
    to use some fundamental data types available in PySpark, build machine learning
    models, operate on graphs, read streaming data, and deploy your models in the
    cloud. Each chapter will tackle different problem, and by the end of the book
    we hope you will be knowledgeable enough to solve other problems we did not have
    space to cover here.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this book you need a personal computer (can be either Windows machine, Mac,
    or Linux). To run Apache Spark, you will need Java 7+ and an installed and configured
    Python 2.6+ or 3.4+ environment; we use the Anaconda distribution of Python in
    version 3.5, which can be downloaded from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The Python modules we randomly use throughout the book come preinstalled with
    Anaconda. We also use GraphFrames and TensorFrames that can be loaded dynamically
    while starting a Spark instance: to load these you just need an Internet connection.
    It is fine if some of those modules are not currently installed on your machine
    – we will guide you through the installation process.'
