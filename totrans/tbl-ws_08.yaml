    in Tableau, their benefits, and how to use them effectively. The goal of this
    chapter is to improve your analytical skills using table calculations by looking
    at data through different views to understand the underlying patterns. By the
    end of this chapter, you will be well positioned to perform complex analysis on
    the data in your visualizations using table calculations.

    year's profit, as well as the current year's profit. With `Furniture`, for example,
    the second value under the running total is computed using the previous value

    performances, i.e. comparing product sales from previous quarters. Continuing

    from all the years' profits. For example, for `Furniture`, you can first compute
    the sum of all the years' profits, which comes to 18,451\. Then, divide each year's
    profits with this number. So, for 2016, you can compute it as 5,458 / 18,451,
    which is 29.58%.

    in the percent distribution of a measure across a specific dimension or table
    structure. This calculation will first subtract a value from its previous value,
    and then compute the percentage change. As you may have noticed, this table calculation
    is a combination of the `Difference` and `Percent of Total` calculations. The
    reason for using a percentage is that absolute numbers do not always show the
    complete picture. For example, the sale of 10 Ferrari cars will generate more
    profit compared to 50 Honda cars. But if you compare this using actual numbers,
    the data will say that Honda is more profitable, even though Ferrari is actually
    more profitable.'

    you notice that all these calculations were working at the row level? What if
    you need to apply calculations at the column level? This is where the concept
    of addressing and partitioning comes into play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Addressing means defining the direction of the calculation. A calculation can
    compute horizontally or vertically, depending on the option selected. Partitioning
    can be defined as the scope of the calculation; for example, you can partition
    a view into various years for different categories, or various categories for
    the same year.

    horizontally across the table and adds the values at the end of each row to the
    first value of the next row. `Table(down then across)` performs the calculation

    first value of the next column.

    a value for the current row/column will be the result of the previous rows/columns
    along with the current row/column.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Considering the previous example of car manufacturer sales, suppose you perform
    `Table(down)` and then `Table(across)` for sales; Tableau would first compute
    the sales for the current year for all products, and then add that value to the
    next year's values. Hence, for the current year, you would get cumulative values
    for the previous years and the current year's sales.
