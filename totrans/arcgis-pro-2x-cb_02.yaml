    However, you have only begun to scratch the surface. One of the things that makes
    ArcGIS Pro so powerful is its ability to make use of many different data types
    and formats.

- en: Unlike other programs, such as Word, Excel, or even AutoCAD, ArcGIS Pro is not
    limited to a single file type. Based on your experience with previous recipes
    you have learned that ArcGIS Pro makes use of project with a `.aprx` file extension. In
    the projects, you accessed a file geodatabase to add new layers to a map and you
    were able to import a map file with a `.mapx` file extension. These are just three
    of the many different files you can bring into ArcGIS Pro. You will encounter
    many more the longer you use ArcGIS Pro.

    you can use with ArcGIS Pro, and their limitations. You will start with the two
    basic data categories, Raster and Vector, to ensure you have a good foundational
    understanding of GIS data. From there, you will learn how to create Esri data
    storage types, such as a Geodatabase and shapefile. Next, you will see how to
    access non-Esri CAD formats so they can be added to your maps. Finally, you will
    explore the use of traditional tabular data in ArcGIS Pro.

    those categories, there are many specific formats. In an ArcGIS Pro project, you
    will often combine both raster and vector data together in order to create maps,
    edit data, and perform analyses. So, what is the difference between these two
    data categories? How do I make use of this data in ArcGIS Pro?

- en: In this recipe, you learned how to add raster and vector data to a map. First,
    you opened an existing project that already contained a map with a single raster
    layer, this was the aerial color photograph. You then zoomed into that layer using
    a bookmark to examine it further. Bookmarks allow you to return to specific locations
    within a map by storing the extents and scale of your map view at the time you
    create the bookmark. This allows you to easily return to a specific location on
    the map. There is no limit on the number of bookmarks that are contained within
    a project.

- en: Once you zoomed into the location using the bookmark, you used the Explore tool
    to access information linked to a cell within the aerial photo to discover it
    included three bands. A different numeric value was assigned to the cell for each
    band, allowing the true color to be displayed in ArcGIS Pro. The information is
    presented in an HTML window that displays the attributes associated with the cell,
    feature, or features being identified. This functionality also allowed you to
    access the information from the parcels layer, which was a vector dataset. From
    this, you were able to see that vector and raster datasets can have different
    attributes that can be customized based on their purpose.

    This came from the Esri Living Atlas as a web service which is hosted by Esri's
    ArcGIS Online. Rasters and vectors can both be published as web services. These
    are typically accessed through a REST point connection. **REST** stands for **Representational
    state transfer**. These types of connections provide interoperability across the
    web along with good performance.

- en: Finally, you added the parcels vector layer to your map and explored it. When
    you added it to your map, the parcel polygons were displayed in the map view.
    ArcGIS Pro does this by reading the *x* and *y* coordinates for each vertex that
    makes up the boundary of each parcel. This was demonstrated when you selected
    a parcel and displayed its vertices using the Vertices button on the Edit tab.

    *x* 和 *y* 坐标来实现这一点。当你选择一个包裹并使用编辑选项卡上的顶点按钮显示其顶点时，这得到了演示。
- en: These coordinates are typically stored in a real-world coordinate system that
    allows it to be displayed with other layers in the correct location on the Earth.
    The *x* and *y* coordinates for each vertex are referred to as a coordinate pair.
    Each pair describes a unique location. In the case of a polygon, no fewer than
    four coordinate pairs are required to fully describe the location and shape of
    a polygon. A line only requires a minimum of two, and a point only one. You will
    learn more about real-world coordinate systems later in this book.

- en: The file geodatabase is designed to be used by small organizations with only
    one or two primary users. It stores information within multiple files that are
    contained in a single folder with a `.gdb` extension. By default, a file geodatabase
    can store up to 1 TB per feature dataset, contained within the geodatabase plus
    at the root of the database. A feature dataset is similar to a folder on you computer
    used to store related files. A feature dataset is used to group related feature
    classes within the geodatabase. The total amount of data that can be stored per
    feature dataset can be changed to 4 or 256 TB using a configuration keyword. To
    learn more about configuration keywords for a geodatabase file, go to [http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/configuration-keywords-for-file-geodatabases.htm](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/geodatabases/overview/configuration-keywords-for-file-geodatabases.htm).

    are built on old technology. They were developed in the 1990s for use with Esri’s
    now-discontinued ArcView GIS application. A shapefile uses dBase tables to store
    its attributes. This greatly limits the amount of data that can be stored, as
    well as the number of fields and field names. Lastly, shapefiles do not have the
    native ability to validate the data they contain, unlike the geodatabase.
