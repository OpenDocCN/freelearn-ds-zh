- en: Data analysis and visualization go hand in hand. Tableau allows users to perform
    in-depth data analysis and share results via interactive visualizations. Tableau
    includes numerous data modeling capabilities that allow users to make sense of
    data and to obtain meaningful insights, without having to deal with advanced database
    concepts. Data modeling is an important concept, and the more data you are working
    with, the more important it is.

- en: As the amount of information we work with grows, we need to be able to efficiently
    perform analysis. Data modeling allows us to not only prepare for our analysis
    but to also make it as efficient as possible. At the end of the day, we use data
    to help us make better decisions. Spending time learning how we can model the
    data will help us identify what questions we can answer, and how to answer them.
    Regardless of the size of the data you are working with, Tableau will help you
    glean insights with ease.

    look for data that will answer your questions. Once you have validated that it
    exists, where it is stored and how to acquire access/permissions (if necessary).
    In most cases, you will be connecting directly to a database using a username
    and password. However, you can also connect to files such as Excel workbooks on
    your local machine. You can even use a combination of both if needs be.

- en: Joining the data allows you to combine tables using common fields in order to
    perform analysis. You can think of joining tables as extending a table by adding
    columns from a source table to a target table. You can combine tables using a
    common field (a column present in both tables) in Tableau. Based on the related
    field, we can combine rows from multiple tables. If the tables you are using are
    from the same source (database, workbook, and so on) then the procedure involves
    a single connection. Working with tables from the same data source is computationally
    more efficient; however, it is not a requirement.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A cross-database join is an inner, left, right, or full outer join between two
    or more tables that are in different databases. You will often encounter multiple
    databases systems that house different information. Order information may be in
    an Amazon Redshift database while information about store locations may be in
    an SQL Server database. To join information from different sources, you will need
    to use a cross-database join.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The four types of joins mentioned previously are available with cross-database
    joins. Cross-database joins require a multi-connection data source setup. This
    means that you need to create a new connection to each database for each of the
    tables that you want to join. We have already connected to the `Global Super Orders
    2016` Excel workbook and brought in the `Orders` table. We want to join orders
    with the `Returns` table but it is in a different file (`Global Superstore Returns
    2016.csv`).

    from the `Global Superstore Returns 2016` flat file has an orange left border
    in the canvas. The borders of the rectangular table button in the canvas corresponds
    to the color of its connection. When viewing the data grid after a cross-database

  prefs:

- en: A union is another way to combine your data. When you union two tables, you
    append the rows from one table to another. Since you are effectively stacking
    tables on top of each other, there is one important condition that must be satisfied
    – the data types of the columns that will be stacked need to be compatible. You
    should not stack a date column on top of a text column.

    sources. Blends allow you to show data from two or more sources in the same view.
    The difference between a blend and a join is that when you blend, you are not
    combining data at the row level. A blend is a relationship. It allows data from
    different sources to be displayed in the same sheet. A data blend is primarily
    used when you need to show data from two different sources that are at a different
    grain.
