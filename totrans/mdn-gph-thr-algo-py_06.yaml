    across countries and epidemics spreading through the **African Institute for Mathematical
    Sciences** (**AIMS**) student population first introduced in [*Chapter 2*](B21087_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028).
    We’ll see how cultural similarity, geography, and shared social traits create
    ties between people and places that influence network structure. We’ll also introduce
    a few important structures commonly found in networks. Finally, we’ll examine
    how the spread of ideas and disease is influenced by network structure through

    Vital records about a population are important for public policy creation, epidemic
    tracking, urban planning, and many other government tasks critical for infrastructure
    and growth. John Snow pioneered the field of demography during the 1854 cholera
    outbreak in London, plotting geographic data and shared characteristics of infected
    individuals to determine the source of the cholera outbreak (a water pump). Since
    then, demography has played a prominent role in medical research, policy planning,
    education reform, and other applications of the social sciences to society’s needs.'

    many demographic factors: age group, educational background, the arrondissement

    a professional connection if they meet at a professional event, and it is possible

    turn to a field of mathematics called differential equations. **Differential equations**
    relate functions and changes in those functions over time (their derivatives)
    across a system of interest. For instance, differential equations can model heat
    flow across a machinery part, opinion changes in a population, gravity’s impact
    on an object in motion, movement of sound through a room, or weather patterns
    over history (among many others!).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Differential equations can include first-order derivatives, or changes in the
    slope of a function of interest, second-order derivatives, related to the curvature
    of the function, and even higher-order derivatives. For spreading processes on
    networks, we’ll limit our discussion to differential equations with first-order
    derivatives. However, any type of differential equation can be defined and run
    using the software we’ll be using on our NetworkX network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, differential equations include multiple variables in the function
    of interest; these equations are called **partial differential equations**. Many
    real-world processes, including epidemic spread models, are modeled with partial
    differential equations. In addition, many real-world processes have a component
    of randomness or a dependency on where the process starts on an object or a network.
    On networks, it’s common to run a partial differential equation many times with
    the same or varying starting points of the process. This allows for a range of
    possible outcomes.

- en: 'Now that we know a bit about differential equations, let’s dive into our model
    of interest for spreads of behavior, ideas, and epidemics: the **susceptible-infected-resistant**
    (**SIR**) model. The SIR model was originally developed to study epidemics (in
    1927), with components related to susceptible individuals in a population (not
    yet infected but able to be infected), infected individuals (those currently infected
    with the disease), and recovered or resistant individuals (those who had been
    infected or were immune and could not be infected).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As individuals mix in the population, infected individuals can pass on their
    infection to those who are susceptible with a certain probability. For our model,
    the probability of infecting a susceptible individual is given by the parameter
    *beta*. In practice, this is either known from estimates in the literature regarding
    behavior or disease spread probability or is estimated within a range of best
    guesses, with models run between those best guesses to estimate potential spread
    within that range of possibilities. Once an individual is infected, that individual
    has a probability of recovery, given by the parameter *gamma*. Once recovered,
    our model does allow for reinfection. In a **susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible**
    (**SIRS**) model, however, individuals who have recovered can be reinfected after
    a period of time. In a **susceptible-infected-susceptible** (**SIS**) model, recovery
    is replaced by an immediate chance of reinfection rather than recovery.

- en: One important property of epidemic spread is the so-called `beta` parameter
    value by our `gamma` parameter value. If R0 is above `1`, the epidemic is expected
    to spread across the population in its initial phases, signaling the potential
    for a large epidemic. Many infectious disease outbreaks have an R0 value above
    `1`, including recent Ebola outbreaks (`R`0`~1.5`), the 1960s measles outbreak
    in Ghana (`R~14`), and the 1918 Spanish flu `(R`0`~1.5` initially and `~3.5` in
    later waves). The R0 value for COVID-19 varied dramatically between variants and
    countries, making it difficult to obtain a standard R0\. However, one estimate
    across Africa puts COVID-19’s estimated R0 at `2.0-9.7` for most countries.

- en: SIR models work a bit differently on networks. An infected vertex typically
    infects only neighbors in the network, creating a proximity effect. In our network,
    the bridging properties limit the chance of spreading from one subnetwork to another,
    as infection rates of a bridge vertex and its adjacent vertices are lower than
    spread through a hub of mutually connected vertices. In general, bridges are important
    vertices in networks with respect to information, ideas, or epidemic spread and
    are often intervention targets. Vaccination campaigns in a disease epidemic to
    limit spread, targeting in a marketing campaign to increase product adoption rates,
    and capturing in a criminal communications network are all real-world examples
    of bridge targeting to impact spread dynamics on a network of interest.

- en: Let’s dive a bit deeper into the geometry of networks, including hubs and bridges.
    **Hubs** are regions of high connectivity, where many vertices connect to many
    other vertices. Geometrically, densely connected regions such as hubs have high
    curvature and provide many possible paths for spreading processes or random walks
    on the network. In our Francophone Africa network, Cameroon, Senegal, and Mali
    all show hub properties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note, however, that Senegal has many edges to other vertices that do not have
    large numbers of edges associated with them. While Senegal serves as a hub owing
    to its connectivity, it does not make an ideal spreading target, as the process
    will die in the fairly isolated vertices surrounding it. Cameroon and Mali, however,
    are hubs connected to other vertices that serve as either hubs or bridges, allowing
    the process to continue spreading with high probability. **Centrality metrics**
    measure how central a vertex is to the network, creating different types of network
    hub measurements that can find vertices that function as Mali/Cameroon or as Senegal
    within the network. We will revisit these centrality measurements in later chapters,
    where we will assess network properties with igraph.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bridges** work a bit differently but also contribute important geometric
    features to networks. Niger and Chad serve as bridges in our Francophone Africa
    network, connecting hubs that share no other edges between them. Technically,
    a type of centrality called **betweenness centrality** measures this bridging
    property by computing the shortest paths between each vertex pair (representing
    the most direct communication route) and counting the number of shortest paths
    that include a given vertex. Those vertices with many of the shortest paths passing
    through them act as bridges between different parts of the network. Geometrically,
    bridges serve as crossing points from one part of a network to another with respect
    to flow. Our music spread from Gabon to West Africa would not be possible without
    bridges such as Chad and Niger connecting North and West Africa with Central Africa,
    as the trend must spread through those countries to leave Central Africa.'

    This gives us R0~2.5, which means our music trend should spread well initially.

    are likely to interact with many other students. This network does not have many
    bridges, but most vertices appear to be hubs. In very dense networks, spreading
    processes tend to move more quickly. The shortest paths between vertices in this
    network will be relatively short compared to the ones in the Francophone Africa
    network, as most vertices are connected or nearly connected to each other. The
    **diameter** of a network, the longest-shortest path, represents the maximum shortest
    travel route for information or disease to spread between two vertices. A small
    network diameter (or a small average shortest path length) suggests efficiency
    in spreading processes, such as information, trends, or disease. Thus, we’d expect
    our AIMS Cameroon student network to be more vulnerable to spreading processes
    than our Francophone Africa network. Technically, the diameter provides bounds
    for differential equations, such as our spreading process, that are defined on
    the network.'

- en: As we can see from *Figure 3**.11*, even densely connected networks are not
    threatened by certain types of epidemics. Without the right conditions to spread
    effectively—either through network structure or through disease characteristics
    impacting spread potential—epidemics fizzle out in populations. However, it is
    possible for a virus with initial dynamics, such as the one shown in *Figure 3**.11*,
    to mutate into something more infectious.

    from an infectious disease to a highly infectious disease, changing R0 from just
    over `1` (allowing for spread) to `3.5`, heralding a worldwide disaster. In practice,
    it’s important to consider a variety of realistic parameter values when simulating
    epidemics circulating through networks of interest, as a small difference in parameters
    can lead to a very different outcome; epidemic planning works best when a wide
    variety of scenarios are simulated.

    development through homophily. We also introduced the concepts of hubs and bridges.
    We then turned to SIR models to show trends and disease spread through social
    networks based on spreading factors in the differential equation models. We considered
    two networks: a geographic network of neighboring Francophone countries and the
    AIMS Cameroon student network with inferred edges based on demographic factors.
    We then examined the role of R0 on both networks through simulations of epidemics
    by changing epidemic parameters; this demonstrated that specific conditions are
    needed for trends or diseases to spread across a network. We’ll revisit these
    ideas and strategies to influence spreading behavior again in [*Chapter 8*](B21087_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor097),
    when we dive into centrality measures in more detail with respect to dynamic network
    metrics change over time as individuals change their connections with others in
    the network over time.'
