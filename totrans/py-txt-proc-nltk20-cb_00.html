Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) suite of libraries has rapidly emerged as one of the most efficient tools for Natural Language Processing. You want to employ nothing less than the best techniques in Natural Language Processing—and this book is your answer.</p><p>
<em>Python Text Processing with NLTK 2.0 Cookbook</em> is your handy and illustrative guide, which will walk you through all the Natural Language Processing techniques in a step-by-step manner. It will demystify the advanced features of text analysis and text mining using the comprehensive NLTK suite.</p><p>This book cuts short the preamble and lets you dive right into the science of text processing with a practical hands-on approach.</p><p>Get started off with learning tokenization of text. Receive an overview of WordNet and how to use it. Learn the basics as well as advanced features of stemming and lemmatization. Discover various ways to replace words with simpler and more common (read: more searched) variants. Create your own corpora and learn to create custom corpus readers for data stored in MongoDB. Use and manipulate POS taggers. Transform and normalize parsed chunks to produce a canonical form without changing their meaning. Dig into feature extraction and text classification. Learn how to easily handle huge amounts of data without any loss in efficiency or speed.</p><p>This book will teach you all that and beyond, in a hands-on learn-by-doing manner. Make yourself an expert in using the NLTK for Natural Language Processing with this handy companion.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec01"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Tokenizing Text and WordNet Basics">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Tokenizing Text and WordNet Basics</em>, covers the basics of tokenizing text and using WordNet.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Replacing and Correcting Words">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Replacing and Correcting Words</em>, discusses various word replacement and correction techniques. The recipes cover the gamut of linguistic compression, spelling correction, and text normalization.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Creating Custom Corpora">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Creating Custom Corpora</em>, covers how to use corpus readers and create custom corpora. At the same time, it explains how to use the existing corpus data that comes with NLTK.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Part-of-Speech Tagging">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Part-of-Speech Tagging</em>, explains the process of converting a sentence, in the form of a list of words, into a list of tuples. It also explains taggers, which are trainable.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Extracting Chunks">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Extracting Chunks</em>, explains the process of extracting short phrases from a part-of-speech tagged sentence. It uses Penn Treebank corpus for basic training and testing chunk extraction, and the CoNLL 2000 corpus as it has a simpler and more flexible format that supports multiple chunk types.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Transforming Chunks and Trees">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Transforming Chunks and Trees</em>, shows you how to do various transforms on both chunks and trees. The functions detailed in these recipes modify data, as opposed to learning from it.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Text Classification">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Text Classification</em>, describes a way to categorize documents or pieces of text and, by examining the word usage in a piece of text, classifiers decide what class label should be assigned to it.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Distributed Processing and Handling Large Datasets">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Distributed Processing and Handling Large Datasets</em>, discusses how to use execnet to do parallel and distributed processing with NLTK. It also explains how to use the Redis data structure server/database to store frequency distributions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Parsing Specific Data">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Parsing Specific Data</em>, covers parsing specific kinds of data, focusing primarily on dates, times, and HTML.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Penn Treebank Part-of-Speech Tags">Appendix</a>, <em>Penn Treebank Part-of-Speech Tags</em>, lists a table of all the part-of-speech tags that occur in the <code class="literal">treebank</code> corpus distributed with NLTK.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for Python programmers who want to quickly get to grips with using the NLTK for Natural Language Processing. Familiarity with basic text processing concepts is required. Programmers experienced in the NLTK will find it useful. Students of linguistics will find it invaluable.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "Now we want to split <code class="literal">para</code> into sentences. First we need to import the sentence tokenization function, and then we can call it with the paragraph as an argument."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"> &gt;&gt;&gt; para = "Hello World. It's good to see you. Thanks for buying this book."
 &gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
 &gt;&gt;&gt; sent_tokenize(para)</pre></div><p>
