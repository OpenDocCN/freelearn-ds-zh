    of quantum technologies based on current limitations, demonstrate the usefulness
    and shortcomings of the current implementations of quantum theory, and share our

    computing, but rather an explanation of how the two topics intertwine through
    the illustration of the postulates of quantum mechanics, particularly with Python

    to energy creation and the development of quantum computing in recent years. With
    adequate knowledge of quantum chemistry and the postulates of quantum mechanics,
    we can overcome some of the major hurdles humanity faces and achieve positive
    impacts. We hope that you can learn sufficient details to be a part of the new
    and productive solutions moving forward.

    are those interested in chemistry and computer science at the early stages of
    learning; advanced high school and early college students, or professionals wanting
    to acquire a background in quantum chemistry as it relates to computing, both
    from an algorithm and hardware standpoint. We also summarize useful mathematics
    and calculus as it relates to solving chemistry problems. The topics will appeal
    to people of various industry verticals who are interested in a career in quantum
    computational chemistry and computing.

- en: We chose to write this book in such a way as to demystify the fundamentals of
    quantum concepts for a curious audience. This book introduces the basics of quantum
    chemical concepts by describing the five postulates of quantum mechanics, including
    how these concepts relate to quantum information theory, including basic programming
    examples of atomic and molecular systems with Python, SimPy [Simpy], QuTiP [QuTiP],
    and open-source quantum chemistry packages PySCF [PySCF], ASE [ASE_0], PyQMC [PyQMC],
    Psi4 [Psi4_0], and Qiskit [Qiskit] code. An introductory level of understanding
    Python is sufficient to read the code, and a browser is all that is required to
    access the Google Colaboratory and run the companion Jupyter notebooks we provide
    in the cloud. Each chapter includes an artistic rendering of quantum concepts
    related to historical quotes.

    development of computational chemistry packages and, most recently, Qiskit Nature
    [Qiskit_Nature] [Qiskit_Nat_0]. We outline and introduce basic quantum chemical
    concepts that are discussed in a modern fashion and relate these concepts to quantum
    information theory and computation. We use Python, PySCF, and Qiskit Nature for
    illustrative purposes.

- en: The fundamentals of quantum mechanics and the five postulates directly impact
    material research and computational chemistry for finding new drugs and catalysts,
    enabling efficient and cleaner processes for converting chemicals from one form
    to another. Quantum chemistry is also essential for designing future quantum computers
    that use the properties of atoms and/or ions. However, quantum chemistry remains
    an elusive topic that seemingly takes many years to master.
  id: totrans-15

- en: We think that the traditionally long-term achievement of literacy of the topic
    is directly related to the perceived complexity of the topic and historical approximations
    made to increase accessibility and usability with conventional computing. With
    approximation in place and wide acceptance by the scientific community as the
    only way forward, some fundamental concepts are often overlooked, misunderstood,
    and eliminated from the disciplines depending on these ideas. We see this as an
    opportunity to share our love of quantum chemistry in its full potential to enhance
    the friendliness of and approachability of the topic.

    were historically established. For instance, we present a general formulation

    for composite particles, which many textbooks do not adequately explain.
