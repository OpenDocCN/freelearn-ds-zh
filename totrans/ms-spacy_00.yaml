- en: spaCy is an industrial-grade, efficient NLP Python library. It offers various
    pre-trained models and ready-to-use features. *Mastering spaCy* provides you with
    end-to-end coverage of spaCy features and real-world applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll begin by installing spaCy and downloading models, before progressing
    to spaCy's features and prototyping real-world NLP apps. Next, you'll get accustomed
    to visualizing with spaCy's popular visualizer displaCy. The book also equips
    you with practical illustrations for pattern matching and helps you advance into
    the world of semantics with word vectors. Statistical information extraction methods
    are also explained in detail. Later, you'll cover an interactive business case
    study that shows you how to combine spaCy features to create a real-world NLP
    pipeline. You'll implement ML models such as sentiment analysis, intent recognition,
    and context resolution. The book further focuses on classification with popular
    frameworks such as TensorFlow's Keras API together with spaCy. You'll cover popular
    topics, including intent classification and sentiment analysis as well as using
    them on popular datasets and interpreting the classification results.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data scientists and machine learners who want to excel in NLP
    as well as NLP developers who want to master spaCy and build applications with
    it. Language and speech professionals who want to get hands-on with Python and
    spaCy and software developers who want to quickly prototype applications with
    spaCy will also find this book helpful. Beginner-level knowledge of the Python
    programming language is required to get the most out of this book. A beginner-level
    understanding of linguistic terminology, such as parsing, POS tags, and semantic
    similarity, will also be useful.

- en: First of all, you'll need Python 3 installed and working on your system. Code
    examples are tested with spaCy v3.0, however, most of the code is compatible with
    spaCy v2.3 due to backwards compatibility. For the helper libraries such as scikit-learn,
    pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, the latest versions available on pip will work.
    We use TensorFlow, transformers, and helper libraries starting with [*Chapter
    7*](B16570_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120)*, Customizing spaCy Models*,
    so you can install these libraries by the time you reach [*Chapter 7*](B16570_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120).
