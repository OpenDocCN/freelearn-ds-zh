- en: Using *just one* data gateway in Enterprise mode, *multiple users* in your organization
    can access on-premises data to which they already have access permission. It goes
    without saying that other users can view and refresh your report, but they cannot
    develop their own reports using R code by referencing your machine with R engines
    through your personal data gateway. This one is the true limitation.

    not with a physical person, but with a *fictitious "service" user*. The credentials
    of this user are shared between all those analysts who use R code to transform
    data into their reports. Also, since the machine with the R engine referenced
    by the data gateway is shared, it must remain on during periods of scheduled activity.
    For this reason, an Azure Windows Virtual Machine on which both the R engine and
    the data gateway run is often used in this architecture.
