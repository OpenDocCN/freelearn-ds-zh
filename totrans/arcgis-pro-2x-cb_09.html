<p>If you have completed the previous chapter, you have begun to get an idea of the analytical power ArcGIS Pro brings to the table. You have seen how it can be used to find features that are near one another and calculate those distances in addition to other attributes. But what if you are not looking to find just the closest feature or calculate how far features are from one another? What if you want to determine whether there are any spatial clusters in your data, to see whether there is some pattern or possible point of origin?</p>
<p>This type of analysis is often called Cluster or Hot Spot analysis. It uses various methods to determine the spatial distribution of data and associated values, so you can see clusters, determine center points, directional distribution, and more. This is done by calculating spatial statistics that can be weighted by other attributes, such as size, total amounts, or counts.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro contains over 25 different tools for calculating spatial statistics. These are all stored in the Spatial Statistics toolbox and divided between five different toolsets, including Analyzing Patterns, Mapping Clusters, Measuring Geographic Distributions, Modeling Spatial Relationships, and Utilities. All but a couple of the tools in this toolbox work with the core ArcGIS Pro product at all license levels. This means that even with a Basic license, you can perform some pretty amazing analysis.  </p>
<p>In this chapter, you will get an opportunity to work with a few of the spatial statistics and hot spot analysis tools that are in ArcGIS Pro. You will perform a hot spot analysis to determine which areas in a city have experienced the most damage or loss due to crime. This will help the city determine where it might want to focus law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>Next, you will calculate the mean center of the members of a professional organization, so you can determine where to look to hold a conference so that it is located at the average center of mass for all the members.</p>
<p>Then, you are going to determine the central building for a company to use, to determine where to relocate its Corporate Headquarters, so it is at the center of all its other offices. This will make it easier for everyone to travel to Headquarters for meetings and reduce overall travel budgets.</p>
<p>Lastly, you will look at a series of crimes to determine whether they are concentrated or clustered in not only a general area but also along a focused direction. This will help determine whether a specific road or other mode of travel may be a contributing factor.</p>

<p>The Police Chief has come to you for help. He is working on a grant to help fund more police officers through a neighborhood policing program. He needs to determine whether there are areas where crime has been occurring that have experienced more damage or loss than others. If such areas exist, he could include that as justification in his grant proposal.</p>
<p>He has provided you with crime data for the city that covers the years 2013 and 2014. This data has been geocoded, so you have a point layer that shows the location of the crimes and is attributed with the Crime Type, Date it occurred, Officer Responding, Damage or Loss in dollars, and number of victims involved. The grant requires all numbers to be summarized to the Census Block level. You will have to use the Spatial Join tool to aggregate the crime data by Census Block.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will use the Hot Spot Analysis tool to see whether there are any geographic clusters of crimes that have resulted in higher-than-normal damage or loss to the victims. In order to perform this analysis, you will first need to aggregate the point data to the census blocks using a spatial join to summarize the crime data.</p>

<li>Using the skills you have acquired from performing the previous recipes, start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>Spatial Stats Hotspots.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter9\Spatial Stats Hotspots</kbd>.</li>
<li>The project should open with the <span class="packt_screen">Union City Crime</span> map. This map contains the Crime Locations provided by the Police Chief, streets, City Limits, Parcels, Census Blocks, and Police Beat Zones. Before we begin with the analysis, we will need to get a better idea of the data we have to work with. Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Crime Locations</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane and select the <span class="packt_screen">Attribute T</span><span class="packt_screen">able</span>. Take a moment to explore the table and answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What fields are in the attribute table for the Crime Locations layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><span>: </span>What type of crimes are identified in the attribute table? </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><span>: </span>What is the largest amount of loss or damage you can find in the table?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<p class="mce-root" style="padding-left: 60px">You can sort fields in ascending or descending order by right-clicking the field name in the table and selecting the desired sorting, much like you can do in a spreadsheet.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Open the attribute table for the <span class="packt_screen">Census Blocks</span> layer using the same process. Review its contents and answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What fields are in the attribute table for the Crime Locations layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><span>:</span></p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You now have a better understanding of the data you will be working with. Since the hot spot analysis is looking for spatial clusters within an area, you will generally get better results using polygon inputs that points. So, it is recommended that you aggregate or summarize your point data to get the best results. That means you will need to aggregate the <span class="packt_screen">Crime Locations</span> data into the <span class="packt_screen">Census Blocks</span> layer, so you can see how many crimes occurred in each block and the total amount of damage in each block. You will use the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool to do this.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Close the open <span class="packt_screen">Attribute tables</span> for the <span class="packt_screen">Crime Locations</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Census Blocks</span> layers.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon. Then click the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> group. This will open the tool in the geoprocessing ribbon.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Target Features</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Census Blocks</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Join Features</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Crime Locations</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Accept the default value for the <span class="packt_screen">Output Feature</span> class.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Join Operation</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Join one-to-one</span> using the drop-down arrow and ensure <span class="packt_screen">Keep All Target Features</span> is checked.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>If you remember from <a href="cbca2a90-3539-4243-8ca3-0010b6f91584.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, Linking Data together, you have two options for the Join Operation: Join one-to-one or Join one-to-many. The Join one-to-one option will aggregate data or sum values if more than one match is found. This is what we want. If the Join one-to-many option is selected, the tool will create multiple records for each match it finds between the Target and Join features. To learn more about the Spatial Join tool, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/analysis/spatial-join.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/analysis/spatial-join.htm</a>.</p>

You should have also seen a new field, <span class="packt_screen">Join_Count</span>. This provides you with a count of the number of crimes that were contained in each Census Block.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now, it is time to perform the hot spot analysis to determine areas where the greatest amount of damage or loss has occurred due to crime.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Finding the mean center of geographic distribution</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When we are looking for clusters of data or trying to determine the overall geographic distribution of our data, one of the first things many of these tools do is determine a center of mass for the data. From there, it can compare nearby features looking for clusters, determine area concentrations of data, look at directional distribution, and more.</p>
<p>However, finding the center of the geographic distribution of our data can be a powerful analytical tool. This can allow us to strategically locate new facilities, pick a central meeting place, plan a reaction to events, and more. There are three types of centers we can calculate: mean, feature, and median.</p>
<p>The Mean Center is the easiest to calculate. It is simply the average of all the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for all features in the layer you are analyzing. The result is the mean center. This can be useful in tracking movement or shifts over time, such as population shifts from urban to suburban areas. You might also use this to locate a good place to hold a meeting that would be centrally-located for all attendees.</p>
<p>The Median Center is sometimes referred to as the Minimum Distance center. Simply put, it is the coordinate pair that represents the location closest to all features in a given layer. Areas will automatically be weighted by the number of features present. Those with a large number of features will pull the median center toward them more than those with fewer features. This can be useful in locating new facilities that may rely on other structures for support.</p>
<p>The Center Feature locates an existing feature that is closest to all other features. This might be helpful if you are looking for a location that would be centrally-located to other facilities. For example, you are planning training for firefighters. You want to hold it at an existing fire station because they have the equipment you need for the training. The Center Feature would allow you to locate the fire station that would be closest to the other stations.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you have been asked to find a central location to hold a conference for a professional organization. You have been provided with a layer showing the locations of all the members. You will use the Mean Center tool to determine the geographic mean center of all the members. This will then identify the area you should look to for holding the conference.   </p>

            <article>
                
<p>You just calculated the mean center for the members of a professional organization using the Mean Center tool. However, when you ran the tool, you left several parameters blank, including <span class="packt_screen">Weight Field</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Case Field</span>. Both of these parameters can change the results of the tool and greatly increase its flexibility.</p>
<p>Often when we are analyzing data, not all the inputs are equal, even in a single layer. Some may need to be given more influence over others. This is certainly true when we are trying to calculate centers. We can reflect this unequal influence by using a weighted field.</p>
<p>When we calculate centers without using a weighted field, as you did with the members, all features are treated the same. No single feature or location carries more weight or influence on the final result than another. However, if you use a <span class="packt_screen">Weight Field</span>, some locations receive greater consideration than others when calculating the mean center. This will cause the center to be pulled toward those weighted locations, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="300" src="assets/5262c186-d8c6-473f-af9a-f3b84db7da73.png" width="448"/></div>
<p>The weight each feature carries when running the analysis is based on a field in the attribute table of the <span class="packt_screen">Input Feature Class</span>. This attribute field must be a numeric type field. Text fields cannot be used as a weighted field. Those with a higher number will have more pull when calculating the center than those with a lower number. This will cause the calculated center to be pulled closer to those with a higher weight.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Case Field</span> groups features for analysis based on values found in that field. This means that your results will have more than one center point returned. You will get a center location calculated for each grouping of features.</p>
<p>So, let’s see how these two fields work. The Police Chief needs more help with his grant application. He is trying to determine the possible location of new precincts within each of the Police Beat Zones. These Zones represent patrol and response areas for the precincts. He needs to know the mean center of the crimes that occur in each Zone. He wants those crimes with the greatest number of victims to be considered more than those with the least. You will use the same Mean Center tool to perform this analysis for the Police Chief. However, this time you will provide values for the <span class="packt_screen">Weight Field</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Case Field</span> parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the Spatial Stats Hotspots project is still open.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Union City Crime</span> map tab at the top of the map view. The map you used to perform the hot spot analysis in the previous recipe should now be displayed.</li>
<li>Right-click the <span class="packt_screen">Crime_Hotspots_DamageLoss</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Remove</span> from the menu that appears. Repeat this process for the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Census Blocks</span> layers as well. This just cleans up the map, so it is easier to read and work with.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, make sure you are on <span class="packt_screen">List by Draw Order</span>. It is the first button on the left at the top of the pane.</li>
<li>Turn on the <span class="packt_screen">Police Beat Zones</span> layer so it is visible. Now you can see the Zones the Police Chief was referring to.</li>
<li>Using the skills you have learned, open the <span class="packt_screen">Mean Center</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you don’t remember how you did that, refer to <em>steps 3-7</em> when you calculated the Mean Center of the members earlier in this recipe.</p>
</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Set <span class="packt_screen">Input Feature Class</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Crime Locations</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Accept the default value provided for the <span class="packt_screen">Output Feature Class</span>.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Weight Field</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">Number of Victims</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Case Field</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">Police Beat Zone</span>.</li>

<ol start="12">
<li>Close the Geoprocessing pane.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should now see that a center point has been located for each of the Police Beat Zones. This is the geographic mean center of all the crimes that occurred in each zone, weighted by the number of victims:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">This means the centers were pulled toward those crimes with the greatest number of victims. If you wanted to see the impact the weight field had on the results, you could re-run the Mean Center tool without the Weight Field being applied. Depending on the number of victims, the difference between the weighted and non-weighted center will vary.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You now know how to calculate the geographic center for a group of features. As you have seen, this can be very useful to help locate new structures, event sites, and so on. It can also be used to compare two sets of data to see whether there is a shift or movement over time. But what if you need to know what feature within a group is the most central? Can you do that?</p>
<p>You can do this using the Center Feature tool. This tool is in the Spatial Statistics Tools toolbox and the Measuring Geographic Distributions toolset. The Central Feature tool identifies the most central feature in a point, line, or polygon in the input feature class. It does this by calculating the distances from the centroid of each feature to every other feature’s centroid. Once that has been calculated, the tool selects the feature that has the shortest distance to all other features and copies it to a new output feature class. The shortest distance calculation will honor Z (elevation) coordinates as well, if they exist. Like the Mean and Median Center tools, you can also use a Weight and Case field if desired. This tool works best with a projected coordinate system. Use of a geographic coordinate system can skew the results due to the inconsistency of the units. To learn more about the specifics of how this tool calculates the center feature, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-central-feature-spatial-statistics-works.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-central-feature-spatial-statistics-works.htm</a>.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you are working for the ACME GIS company that recently merged with another company. This resulted in many new locations being added. The CEO thinks it might be best to move to the Corporate Headquarters, currently located in the Chicago area, to a more centrally-located office. This will help reduce travel time for meetings and other events. So, he has asked you to determine the most central office within the organization. He does want you to take into account the number of employees at each location as well. The offices with more employees should be given greater consideration in your analysis.  </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You can now determine the geographic center and central feature for a grouping of data. As you have seen, this can be a very powerful type of analysis. It can help you sight new locations, determine the focal point of a series of incidents, find the center of mass for a group of features, and more. But what if you need to know where the area of greatest concentration of features is, or how compact or spread out the data is around its geographic center? Such analysis can help you to locate clusters of data or see shifts in behavior.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro’s Standard Distance tool, located in the Spatial Statistics Tools toolbox, and the Measuring Geographic Distributions toolset allows you to do this. It measures the compactness of a distribution around the mean center of a group of features. The smaller the distance calculated, the less the data is dispersed. It is more compact. The larger the distance calculated, the more the data is dispersed, meaning it is less compact. The output from this tool will either be a new polygon feature class for 2D analysis or a Multipatch 3D Sphere. So, this tool works with 3D data analysis as well. To learn more about how this tool calculates the dispersion of data, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-standard-distance-spatial-statistic-works.htm/">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-standard-distance-spatial-statistic-works.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Because of your help with his Neighborhood Policing Grant, the Police Chief was impressed and is back for more help. He believes that there is a shift in crime patterns as the year progresses and the holiday season draws closer. He wants to shift patrols from the residential areas to the area around the mall, commercial district, and interstates as the holiday season approaches. However, the City Council believes that this might make the citizens unhappy, so they oppose the shift in police resources.</p>
<p>The Chief has asked for your help to determine whether there is indeed a change in the crime patterns as he believes, and to provide him with something he can take to City Council to make his case.  He also wants analysis for each Police Beat Zone. In this recipe, you will use the Standard Distance tool to determine the concentration of crimes for the first half of the year and the last half by Beat Zone. This will allow you to see whether there is truly a change in the crime patterns as the year progresses, by demonstrating whether there is a shift in the central location as well as the area of concentrations.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">When you run the query, approximately 70 crimes should be selected within the map. This should be all the crimes that occurred during the first half of the year.

<p style="padding-left: 60px">A new layer will appear in your map once the tool is complete. This represents the geographic distribution for the crimes that occurred during the first half of 2017 in the city. The map should look something like this:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">The circles represent the concentration of the crimes around the mean center for each group by Police Beat Zone. So, you should have five circles. Notice that not all the crimes that occurred in each Zone are inside the circle. That is because the circle represents the overall distribution or concentrations of the crimes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now that you know the distribution for the first half of the year, it is time to analyze the last half of the year.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You can now see the distribution of crimes for the last half of the year and visually compare it to the first half:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">It would appear that the Police Chief is correct. The data does show that the concentration of crimes does shift toward the commercial district, mall, and interstate area. You can see that the distribution for Zone 1W contracts and shifts southeast toward the commercial district located along Roosevelt Highway that runs through the middle of the City. The same is true for Zone 3 that contracts along Shannon Parkway, another major commercial thoroughfare. Zone 2 actually expands toward both Shannon Parkway and Roosevelt Highway during the last half of the year.  The concentration for Zone 1E stays about the same size but certainly shifts south toward the intersection of US Highway 29, Scarborough Road, and Stonewall Tell Road. This is another major artery with a lot of commercial development.</p>

<li>Save your project and close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, as you saw, your analysis supported the Police Chief’s theory. He seems to be correct. You can now provide him with the data he needs to take to the City Council, so they can make an informed decision about the distribution of police resources.</p>
