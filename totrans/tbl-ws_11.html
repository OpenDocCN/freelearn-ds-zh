		</div>
		<div><p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter will dive deep into the order of operations, filters, and sets and parameters in Tableau. We will also work through exercises on using groups and hierarchies in our views. Some of these features of Tableau give end users the ability to control the view. Finally, we will be discussing an activity that will utilize context filters, parameters, and sets on the World Indicator dataset to reinforce the skills you will gain in this chapter. By the end of this chapter, you will have gained the skills to create interactive reports, which give end users more control to slice and dice the data in the report.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you will explore your options in creating reports/dashboards in Tableau, which allows you to arrange your data or report in a more comprehensible manner for your stakeholders/audience. Previous chapters have focused a lot on creating calculated fields, table calculations, and advanced calculations such as level of detail calculations. These types of calculations can help you go a long way in achieving desired results/views. However, you can also explore other ways of arranging, sorting, or grouping your data, adding another layer of interactivity to your reports, which in turn helps improve the ease of use of reports. This chapter will dive deeper into the order of operations, filters, and sets and parameters in Tableau from a conceptual as well as a practical perspective and discuss how to make the best use of these features in your reports/dashboards. In this chapter, you will review how to group data and hierarchy use cases and consider an interesting use case for parameters.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>Grouping Data</h1>
			<p>The grouping of data is useful when you want to simplify or stack multiple dimension rows/members into one bigger bucket. For example, say you are working on a report on the population of countries in the world, and the standard data does not contain a custom grouping of all the South Asian countries. When you decide to create a custom grouping of all the South Asian countries by grouping countries such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and so on, you will notice that a new dimension is added in your <code>Data</code> pane:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1: Sub-category group in the Sample - Superstore dataset</p>
			<p>As is often the case with Tableau features, you can achieve the same results in multiple ways. You can use either of the following methods to create a group:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a group from the worksheet view.</li>
				<li>Create a group from the <code>Data</code> pane.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You'll practice the both of these options in the following exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Exercise 11.01: Creating Groups</h2>
			<p>You are a retail analyst of XYZ group tasked to group multiple sub-categories so that it is easier for a sub-category manager to report on their KPIs of sales:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a bar chart of <code>Sales</code> across <code>Category</code> and <code>Sub-Category</code> as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_02.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2: Sales by Subcategory view&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p><strong class="bold">Creating a Group from the Worksheet View:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> and select or press <em class="italic">Command</em>. Select the sub-category to select multiple <code>Sub-category</code> members in the view. Then, either right-click to group them or click on the group icon in the toolbar or within the tooltip as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_03.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3: Adding groups&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3: Adding groups</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">As you can see, a new <code>Labels, Paper, Storage, and Supplies</code> sub-category grouping is created. You can also rename the sub-category grouping by right-clicking and changing the alias name to be more descriptive, such as <em class="italic">Desk Stationery</em> if you desire.</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4: Naming groups</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Creating a Group from the Data Pane</strong></p>
			<p>In the previous steps, you used the worksheet view to create a group. Now you'll create a separate group via the <code>Data</code> pane:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Create a new worksheet as you did in the steps above. </li>
				<li>Create a bar chart of <code>Sales</code> across <code>Category</code> and <code>Sub-Category</code> as shown here:</li>

				<li value="8">In the group pop-up window, change the field name to something more descriptive: <code>Papers Sub-Category(group)</code>.</li>
				<li>Hold <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> or <em class="italic">Command</em> and multi-select the sub-categories that you want to group. In this case, group all paper related items in one group and click on the <code>Group</code> button:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.9 The groups sub-category</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you explored two ways of creating groups: via the worksheet view and the <code>Data</code> pane. With your completion of this task, sub-category managers now have a way of looking at their KPIs for multiple grouped sub-categories.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to edit the grouping now or in the future, right-click on the new group dimension that was created (the dimension with the <em class="italic">clip</em> icon) in the <code>Data</code> pane and click on <code>Edit Group</code>. In the <code>Edit Group</code> popup, you can drag and drop to remove members or add new members to the group.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Hierarchies</h1>
			<p>Hierarchies are not specific to Tableau. As such, you have almost certainly used them previously, whether consciously or unconsciously. In a data context, when the relevant data is arranged logically based on its level of detail, it is called a <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset, you have already used hierarchies many times, including the <code>Location</code> hierarchy, which contains <code>Country/Region</code>, <code>State</code>, <code>City</code>, and <code>Postal Code</code>; the <code>Product</code> hierarchy consists of <code>Category</code>, <code>Sub-Category</code>, <code>Manufacturer</code>, and <code>Product Name</code>. Hierarchies grant you a comprehensive look into your data. For example, if you add the <code>State</code> dimension to your view, because of the hierarchies that were pre-created in your data, you can switch from state to city by clicking on the <code>+</code> icon in your shelf or go a level up by clicking the <code>-</code> sign as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_10.jpg" alt="Figure 11.10: Default hierarchies&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.10: Default hierarchies</p>
			<p>Take a look at how hierarchies can be created through the following short exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>Exercise 11.02: Creating Hierarchies</h2>
			<p>As an e-commerce analyst of emzon.com, the product catalog manager wants to add <code>Segment</code> to the <code>Product</code> hierarchy. You will have to initially remove the original <code>Product</code> hierarchy and later create a new <code>Product</code> hierarchy by combining one of the existing ones.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you load the default <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset provided by Tableau in Tableau Desktop, you may notice that some fields are missing or new fields have been added. That is expected as Tableau constantly updates data files as per the requirements. If you want to avoid confusion, download the dataset from the official GitHub repository for this chapter, available here: <a href="https://packt.link/eLmSX">https://packt.link/eLmSX</a>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance, if it is not already open.</li>
				<li>Follow <em class="italic">Step 2</em> and <em class="italic">Step 3</em> below only if your version of data has a <code>Product</code> hierarchy inbuilt. If not, proceed to step 4 directly. Assuming in your <code>Data</code> pane you find a <code>Decision Tree</code> icon(as shown below) attached to <code>Product</code> dimension, the decision tree signifies that the dimension is a hierarchy and can be drilled down in your view.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_11.jpg" alt="Figure 11.11: The hierarchy icon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.11: The hierarchy icon</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Navigate to the <code>Product</code> dimension in your <code>Dimensions</code> data pane and right-click the <code>Product</code> dimension. Then click on <code>Remove Hierarchy</code>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_12.jpg" alt="Figure 11.12: Removing the hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.12: Removing the hierarchy</p>
			<p>As soon as you remove the hierarchy, the <code>Decision Tree</code> icon is also removed and all the dimensions that were part of the hierarchy subsequently become their own dimensions. You will also be unable to drill them down as they are no longer logically arranged.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">To re-construct the hierarchy that we just removed, multi-select dimensions by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> and selecting (for Windows) or <em class="italic">Command</em> and selecting (for Mac) all the dimensions that were a part of the product hierarchy. In this case, this will be <code>Category</code>, <code>Sub-Category</code>, <code>Manufacturer</code>, <code>Product name</code>, and <code>Segment</code>.</li>
				<li>After selecting all the dimensions mentioned, right-click on any of the selected dimensions, hover over <code>Hierarchy</code>, click on <code>Create Hierarchy…</code>, and name the hierarchy <code>Product</code> as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_13.jpg" alt="Figure 11.13: Creating a new hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.13: Creating a new hierarchy</p>
			<p>Ideally, the order of multi-select in the previous steps should have allowed Tableau to select the level of your hierarchies. Unfortunately, Tableau levels them alphabetically, which is not the level you want:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_14.jpg" alt="Figure 11.14: The newly created hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.14: The newly created hierarchy</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Before you create a hierarchy, you should have a good idea of the logical leveling of the hierarchy. In this case, these were <code>Category</code> | <code>Sub-Category</code> | <code>Manufacturer</code> | <code>Product name</code> | <code>Segment</code>. Drag your dimensions above or below depending on the level. For example, <code>Sub-Category</code> is below <code>Segment</code>, so drag <code>Sub-Category</code> above <code>Product Name</code> and <code>Manufacturer</code>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_15.jpg" alt="Figure 11.15: Dragging dimensions to change their logical order&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.15: Dragging dimensions to change their logical order</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Check if the hierarchy is working as expected. Drag the <code>Product</code> hierarchy to the <code>Rows</code> shelf and double-click on <code>Sales</code> to create a <code>Sales</code> report by <code>Product</code> hierarchy. </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_16.jpg" alt="Figure 11.16: Final hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.16: Final hierarchy</p>
			<p>Like groups, hierarchies can be useful when you can logically arrange relevant data points based on their level of detail or granularity. You just removed as well as re-created a <code>Product</code> hierarchy in this exercise.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Filters: The Heart and Soul of Tableau</h1>
			<p>If you want to differentiate yourself from a casual Tableau developer, understanding the order of operations and the order in which Tableau manipulates and filters data is critical. In other words, to be a true expert in Tableau, you need to be able to determine when and where data was filtered and pinpoint the reason when the view doesn't produce the data you expect. </p>
			<p>Think of the order of operations as the query pipeline. The order in which Tableau filters data is critical and Tableau follows a sequential order, as shown in the following chart. </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_17.jpg" alt="Figure 11.17: Tableau table of operations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.17: Tableau table of operations</p>
			<p>When you create business dashboards in Tableau, you will have multiple filters, table calculations, and calculated fields to work with. As is the case with most programs, execution follows a set order/operation priority. The order of operations is just that. In the chart above, <code>Extract Filters</code> has the highest priority, followed by <code>Data Source Filters</code> and <code>Context Filters</code>, and <code>Trend Lines, Reference Lines</code> has the lowest priority. In the following sub-sections, we will try to explain most of the filters with an exercise to demonstrate the importance of this.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>Data Source and Extract Filters</h2>
			<p>Data Source and Extract filters are the first in the order of operations in Tableau and take place before you create your first view or when you are loading your data into the Tableau instance. This type of filtering is useful when you don't want to load all the data from your server/source file into the Tableau instance. See this in practice in the following exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Exercise 11.03: Filtering Data Using Extract/Data Source Filters</h2>
			<p>As an analyst, you want to load only a sub-region of data into your Tableau worksheet to lower the load on the dashboard and limit the amount of data being downloaded into the worksheet. Create a view of <code>Sales</code> by <code>State</code> for the <code>East</code> region only.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you don't have it open already.</li>
				<li>Before creating a sample view, double-click on <code>Data Source</code> at the bottom-left of your screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_18.jpg" alt="Figure 11.18: Data pane view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.18: Data pane view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">To import data for the <code>East</code> region only for your view, add that as a <code>Data Source Filter</code> here. On the <code>Data Source</code> page, click on <code>Add</code> in the <code>Filters</code> section at the top right of the view.</li>

				<li value="4">In the <code>Edit Data Source Filters</code> window, click the <code>Add…</code> button, select <code>Region</code>, and click <code>OK</code>. Just select <code>East</code> from the list and click the <code>OK</code> button. Click the <code>OK</code> button again to close the dialog box:</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.20: Adding data source filters</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.21: Data after adding a data source filter</p>
			<p>You might not notice the difference in speed when loading any of the dimensions in your view because the data is not at gigabyte or terabyte scale. If you were working with large-scale data, utilizing data source filtering is one way to improve the speed and efficiency of your work.</p>
			<p>When the data source you are importing contains more data than your report/dashboard requires, you can utilize data source filters to improve the efficiency and reduce the load on Tableau views. In this exercise, your goal was to improve the performance of your dashboard, and by using data source filters, you were able to limit the amount of data being loaded in the worksheet.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Filters Using Views</h2>
			<p>These types of filters resemble how you group dimensions using views. In this type of filtering, you manually select one or multiple data points in the view to include or exclude from the view. In the following exercise, you'll perform these simple steps to create a filter in this way.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Exercise 11.04: Creating Filters from the View</h2>
			<p>As an analyst, you have been given completely new data, and as part of the dashboard designing process, you want to do some <strong class="bold">Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">EDA</strong>). Creating filters using the view can be a great way of filtering data as you see the data in the worksheet. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you have not already done so.</li>
				<li>Create a bar chart of <code>Sales</code> by <code>State</code>. Drag and drop <code>State</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf and <code>Sales</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf. You should end up with the following view:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.25: Final output after creating the filter from the view</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you practiced manually selecting or dragging and selecting a subset of the view to include/exclude from the view. Creating filters using the view can be incredibly helpful when you initially conduct EDA, which is what all analysts start with when creating a new dashboard. Next, we will dive deep into how to best utilize the <code>Filters</code> shelf.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor345"/>Creating Filters Using the Filters Shelf</h2>
			<p>In previous sections, we looked at filtering data either at the data source level or using views, but the right way to utilize filters in Tableau is via the <code>Filters</code> shelf. In this section, we will discuss how to use the <code>Filters</code> shelf for filtering dimensions, measures, as well as dates. But first, we will dive deep into the options of the <code>Filter</code> dialog box, which opens up when you drag any of the mentioned data types. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor346"/>Dimension Filters Using the Filters Shelf</h3>
			<p>Dimensions in Tableau are essentially categorical data. When filtering a dimension, you either include or exclude some part of this data from the view. The following dialog box opens up whenever you drag a dimension to the <code>Filters</code> shelf:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_26.jpg" alt="Figure 11.26: Dragging a dimension to the Filters shelf&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.26: Dragging a dimension to the Filters shelf</p>
			<p>The box has four tabs, as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Sub-Category</code> on <code>Supplies</code> and <code>Tables</code>, you could manually select only two sub-categories to include, as shown below:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_27.jpg" alt="Figure 11.27: Filters shelf General tab&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.27: Filters shelf General tab</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Wildcard</code> tab is used to match a pattern of text to use the filter on. Say you had a column with thousands of URLs, which may or may not contain the term <code>football</code> in the URL. It would be quite tiring to use the <code>General</code> tab to manually select all the URLs that contain the term <code>football</code>, but using <code>Wildcard</code>, you can match the value by stating that the dimension either contains, starts with, ends with, or exactly matches the term <code>football</code> for your URL dimensions.</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_28.jpg" alt="Figure 11.28: Filters shelf Wildcard tab&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.28: Filters shelf Wildcard tab</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Condition</code> tab, you define rules or criteria for filtering the data. For example, you could also use the <code>Condition</code> tab to filter on those sub-categories that reported losses in your data. To do that, select <code>By field</code>, and in the dropdown, select <code>Profit</code> with <code>Sum</code> as aggregation and <code>&lt; 0</code> as shown below:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_29.jpg" alt="Figure 11.29: Filters shelf Condition tab&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.29: Filters shelf Condition tab</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Top</code> tab in the <code>Filter</code> box when you want to compute the <code>Top</code> or <code>Bottom</code> N members of the view depending on the measure you want to filter the view on. In this example, you know that the <code>Bottom</code> three sub-categories are the rows with losses, so you can create a <code>Bottom</code> filter using these details, as shown here:</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In your career as a data analyst, you will likely find yourself using the <code>Filters</code> shelf day in and day out as part of your job, making this an essential skill to have under your belt. In this exercise, you explored all the options Tableau has to offer in the <code>Filters</code> shelf for dimensions.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>Measure Filters Using the Filters Shelf</h3>
			<p>Measures are quantitative data, which means, unlike dimensions, filtering on measures involves selecting a range of numbers that you want to include/exclude from your view. Whenever you drag a <code>Measure</code> onto the <code>Filters</code> shelf, the <code>Filter</code> dialog box offers you four options to filter the <code>Measure</code> on. The following list will define these options in greater detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Measure Filter Dialog Box</strong>:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.34: Range of values in the Filter window</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Range of values</code>, you specify the range of values you want to filter on. In this use case, you only want profitable sub-categories, so your range will be from zero to the maximum as shown in the next screenshot <em class="italic">(Figure 11.35)</em>.</li>
				<li><code>At least</code>, you specify the minimum value and all values greater or equal to the minimum value will be included in your view. This can usually be used when you don't have control over what the maximum for the column/data could be, and it is difficult to predict. In this use case, your minimum will be zero because you want only profitable sub-categories as shown here:</li>
			</ul>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.35: At least filter window</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>At most</code> is the opposite of <code>At least</code> and is used when you want to include all values that are less than or equal to the maximum specified. This can usually be used when you don't have control over the minimum but know the maximum value that you want to be included in your view, which is exactly opposite to that of the <code>At least</code> tab. You cannot use <code>At most</code> for this use case identifying profitable sub-categories because all the negative values will also be included in the view, and you don't have control over them if you use <code>At most</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Special</strong>: As the name suggests, this filter is only used when you want to include either null values, non values, or all values. This tab is rarely used, but depending on the data, it may be required.</li>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>Date Filters Using the Filters Shelf</h3>
			<p>Dates are neither qualitative data nor quantitative data out of the box. We can filter dates either by <code>Relative Date</code>, <code>Range of Dates</code>, or filtering by discrete dates. Let's explore each one of the options and how they differ from each other, and in the exercise after the explanation, walk through a specific use case.</p>
			<p>When you drag a <code>Date</code> dimension such as <code>Order Date</code> in your <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset, you are presented with the following window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_40.jpg" alt="Figure 11.40: Date filter modal window&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.41: Filter by Relative dates</p>
			<p>Relative dates are defined from the date the view was opened. If the data source only has dates till December 2019 and you are opening this in July 2020, the view will only include dates from August 2019 to the maximum date that is present in the data, which in this case is December 2019. Hence you will only see five months' worth of data. To change that, you can check <code>Anchor relative to</code> at the bottom left and enter the date as December 31, 2019, as shown here. </p>

			<p>In the next section, we will look at how you can give the end user of your report/dashboard the ability to filter the report as per their requirements.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Quick Filters</h2>
			<p>Thus far, you have been using filters on your data as a developer without giving end users the ability to filter on a view. One of the many reasons why Tableau is a beloved tool across the developer as well as the end user community is because it allows even end users to control the flow of data in a view. This reduces the back-and-forth with developers because the end user can use the filters to change the data and get the insights they desire. This type of end user filter control is achieved with quick filters.</p>
			<p>There are multiple ways of showing your quick filters. The major differences between them are as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_51.jpg" alt="Figure 11.51: Quick filter types&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.51: Quick filter types</p>
			<p>Each quick filter has a specific purpose and is widely used across pretty much every dashboard you will ever build. In the following exercise, you'll explore a specific example and review the exact steps to add quick filters to your view.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Exercise 11.8: Creating Quick Filters</h2>
			<p>Create a simple view of <code>Sales</code> by <code>State</code> and use <code>Region</code> as a quick filter, as regional managers will use the dashboard to filter on their specific dashboard. Use the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset once again to complete this exercise.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you don't have it open already.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You are going to create a cross table of <code>Sales</code> by <code>State</code> and use <code>Region</code> as a quick filter, but first you need to build the view. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Drag and drop <code>State</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf and, next, double-click on <code>Sales</code> to create the table of <code>Sales</code> by <code>State</code>. We will now add <code>Region</code> as a filter in our <code>Filters</code> shelf by selecting all values:</li>

			<p>Quick filters are why Tableau is such a powerful tool even for end users. In this section, you have learned the major differences between the types of quick filters and the best use cases for them. You then created <code>Sales</code> by <code>State</code> and used <code>Region</code> as a quick filter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Applying Filters across Multiple Sheets/Multiple Data Sources or an Entire Data Source</h2>
			<p>When you add a filter to your view, it only applies to your current view. But there will be times when you want to apply the same filter across multiple selected, using the same or a related data source if there is a relationship between primary and secondary data. This section will examine the difference between each of these options and when to use them.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_58.jpg" alt="Figure 11.58: Apply to Worksheets options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.58: Apply to Worksheets options</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Applying a filter to <code>Only This Worksheet</code>: Here the filter(s) added to the worksheet is only applied to the worksheet to which the filter was added.</li>
				<li>Applying a filter to <code>Selected Worksheets...</code>: If you want your filters to be applied across multiple worksheets or even all of your worksheets, this option comes in handy. In the previous section, you created the <code>Region</code> filter. Say you want to use the same filter across a couple of other worksheets that are part of the Tableau workbook. You can do that as shown here:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_59.jpg" alt="Figure 11.59: Apply a filter to the selected worksheets&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.59: Apply a filter to the selected worksheets</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Applying a filter to <code>All Using This Data Source</code>: If you want to filter all worksheets that use the same <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset using the <code>Region</code> dimension, use this option. You can achieve the same result by selecting all worksheets in the <code>Selected Worksheets</code> option if the workbook only contains one data source.</li>
				<li>Applying a filter to <code>All Using Related Data Sources</code>: Choose this option when you want to use the filter from the current worksheet across multiple data sources. This feature was released in 2016, and when Tableau announced this feature release, the company mentioned that it was one of the most asked for features of all time. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>This option only works when you create a relationship between a current or primary data source and a secondary data source. You do that by navigating to <code>Data</code> in the menu bar, then clicking on <code>Edit Relationships</code>. If Tableau does not automatically create some relationships between the data sources, you can create a custom relationship depending on the use case. </p>
			<p><code>Custom Relationship</code> comes in handy when the names of the common columns across the data sources don't match. Once you are able to create the relationship, you can select <code>All using Related Data Sources</code> for its magic to work. This option comes in handy when you are data blending, which was discussed in previous chapters.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>Context Filters</h2>
			<p>When you add multiple filters into your Tableau view, each of these filters is calculated independently of the others. So, if you have two quick filters such as <code>Category</code> and <code>Sub-Category</code> in your view, when you select/deselect a filter, Tableau uses all of its data to show you the view. </p>
			<p>If you want to limit the calculation across the whole data source and improve the performance of your report/dashboard (more on this in the exercise that follows), you'll want to use context filters. These help Tableau understand the context of the data and limit the amount of data filtering/loading that happens whenever you change a filter in your view. </p>
			<p>In the Tableau order of operations, <code>Context Filters</code> has third priority. So when you set a filter as a context filter, you are essentially creating <em class="italic">one</em> independent filter and all other filters that are not context filters become dependent filters. This is because those other quick filters will process only the data that is first passed through the context filter. </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_60.jpg" alt="Figure 11.60: Tableau order of operations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.60: Tableau order of operations</p>
			<p>An example of this in practice is detailed below. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Exercise 11.09: Creating and Using Context Filters</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will create and use context filters in an example use case with the <code>Sample – Superstore</code> dataset to see why mastering the Tableau order of operations is so beneficial. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you don't have it open already.</li>
				<li>Create a <code>Sales</code> by <code>Sub-Category</code> bar chart view, sort it descending by <code>Sales</code>, and add <code>Category</code> to the <code>Filters</code> shelf and show it as a quick filter. You should have the following view:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_61.jpg" alt="Figure 11.61: Sales by Sub-Category view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.61: Sales by Sub-Category view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">To show only the top five sub-categories by sales, add the sub-category in the <code>Filters</code> shelf, and using the <code>Top</code> tab, filter on the top five sub-categories by <code>Sum</code> of <code>Sales</code> as shown here:<div><img src="img/B16342_11_62.jpg" alt="Figure 11.62: Top N filter view&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p>  </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.62: Top N filter view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Note that all the top five sub-categories in the view. However, if you start de-selecting some of the <code>Category</code> quick filters, you will notice that only some of the top five sub-categories remain in the view.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_63.jpg" alt="Figure 11.63: Need for context filters&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.63: Need for context filters</p>
			<p>The reason this happens (as you can see in the following figure) is that top N gets filtered first in Tableau operations before dimension filtering is applied to the view. Therefore, when you use the top N filter, Tableau has already calculated the top N for the dimension in the view; and when you use a secondary dimension for filtering, it gets filtered on the top N data and not the whole dataset. </p>

				<li value="5">Use context filters to counter this since, in the order of operations, these are executed before top N filters, as seen in the preceding figure.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Major benefits of context filters are as follows:</p><p class="callout"><code>TEMP</code> table with the context and subsequent filters in the order of operations after the context filter references the <code>TEMP</code> table for calculating. Say you have a Customer Order database with 100 million rows, and you want to only look at customers in California, which is 18 million rows. By using a context filter on <code>State</code>, you are limiting the querying of your whole dataset so that only a subset of the California data will be used for calculating all subsequent filters. This is extremely useful.</p><p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Top N Filters</strong>: As discussed above, if your view has top N filters, utilizing a context filter is highly recommended so that the filter works in the desired way of showing all the top N irrespective of the secondary filter selected!</p></li>
				<li>To fix this issue, change your <code>Category</code> filter type to a context filter by right-clicking on <code>Category</code> and selecting <code>Add to Context</code> as shown here:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.66: View after making Category a context dependent filter</p>
			<p>As expected, after using <code>Category</code> as a context filter, the changes in <code>Category</code> quick filters are appropriately reflected in the view. <code>Category</code> becomes the dependent filter, where the top five sub-categories' filters become the independent filters that process the data that is passed through the context filter. It is now showing the top five sub-categories while using <code>Category</code> in context.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you explored why context filters are important and how the order of operations dictates how data is presented in the view. The context filter in this exercise was <code>Category</code>, which became the dependent variable, and the top N sub-category became the independent variable in our case.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Sets</h1>
			<p>Sets are custom-created fields used to define a subset of data based on pre-defined conditions or rules.</p>
			<p>Think of sets as custom segments that are always binary: a data point is either in or out of the segment depending on whether the data point meets the criteria defined. Sets are created on dimensions, though your conditions can include measures if required. Sets can either be static or dynamic, and you can also combine multiple sets into one set in Tableau, which can be pretty useful, as you will learn from the following exercises. A set is identified in the <code>Data</code> pane by the field with a <em class="italic">Venn diagram</em> icon as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_67.jpg" alt="Figure 11.67: Venn diagram icon&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.67: Venn diagram icon</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Static Sets</h2>
			<p>As mentioned in the preceding section, sets can be either dynamic or static. In static sets, you define the set rules and create a fixed subset of the data, where the members of the set are not updated if the underlying data is updated with new data. For example, you create a Top City set manually, selecting New York, San Francisco, Mumbai, and London. The set members won't be changed even when new data is added or deleted. It's a static set. Dynamic sets can help counter this, but you will learn about dynamic sets in later exercises.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Exercise 11.10: Creating Static Sets</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will create a view of the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset where all products that contain <code>Envelope</code> as part of their name are grouped together as <code>In</code> while everything else is grouped as <code>Out</code>.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you don't have it open already.</li>
				<li>Create a view of <code>Sales</code> and <code>Profit</code> by <code>Product Name</code>. Drag and drop <code>Product Name</code> to <code>Rows</code> and double-click <code>Sales</code> and <code>Profit</code> to get the following view:</li>

			<p>In the <code>Create Set</code> dialog box, you will notice there are three tabs (<code>General</code>, <code>Condition</code>, and <code>Top</code>), which are pretty similar to those of filters if you remember from the previous section.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Create a set for any product that has <code>Envelope</code> as part of its <code>Product Name</code>. Select the <code>Select From List</code> radio button, search for <code>Envelope</code>, and press the <code>All</code> button to select the list of all the products that contain <code>Envelope</code> as part of their name.

			<p>Before you click on the <code>OK</code> button, look at the <code>Summary</code> section in the <code>Create Set</code> dialog box and note that your set contains 48 out of 1,850 values. As mentioned previously, this way of manually selecting items for set creation is static, where the set members won't get updated if new records/rows are added to the data at a later date.

			<p>In this exercise, you encounterd sets for the first time and observed how static sets are used on dashboards. You also learned to show/hide members from a set and what the <code>Summary</code> tab in the <code>Create Set</code> dialog box means. </p>
			<p>The next section will review dynamic sets and how they can overcome the shortcomings of static ones.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Dynamic Sets</h2>
			<p>In this section, you will learn why dynamic sets are preferred over static sets. You'll also practice using the two remaining tabs from the <code>Create Set</code> dialog box you encountered in the previous section. Dynamic sets use logic to dynamically update the members of the set, which means when the data changes, the set will be re-computed and the <code>In</code>/<code>Out</code> members can be added/deleted depending on the computation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Exercise 11.11: Creating Dynamic Sets</h2>
			<p>Though previous sets that you created were good, but the product manager responsible for all <code>Envelope</code> products has asked you to create a dynamic view of the groupings as he wants to update the <code>In</code>/<code>Out</code> groups whenever a new product name is added or deleted. You will be using the same view that you created in the previous exercise and extending that view to add dynamic sets.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>Sample - Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you have not already done so.</li>
				<li>Create a view of <code>Sales</code> and <code>Profit</code> by <code>Product Name</code>. Drag and drop <code>Product Name</code> to <code>Rows</code> and double-click <code>Sales</code> and <code>Profit</code> to get the following view:</li>

			<p>With this exercise, you are now able to create a non-static set that can update the set members depending on the changes made to the dataset or when new data is added or deleted from the set. Dynamic sets are usually preferred over static sets because they allow you to ensure new data is populated in sets in the future when you are not actively working on the dashboard.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>Adding Members to the Set</h2>
			<p>In both the previous sections, you created sets from scratch. In this section, we will address those cases in which you want to add more conditions to your set definition to add new members or delete them. Adding members to the set is more often done when stakeholders want to update the condition of the underlying set or the developer wants to experiment with complicated conditional logic. </p>
			<p>The following exercise will guide through how to complete this task.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>Exercise 11.12: Adding Members to the Set</h2>
			<p>For the <code>Envelope Product Set</code> you created in the previous section, the product manager wants you to add a specific product to the set since they cannot add that product <code>IN</code> the set from their view and that product is not part of the top N sales or profit. As the dashboard developer, you are tasked with adding that specific product to the set. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">You will be reusing the view that you created in the previous exercise, but to demonstrate the workings of adding members to the set, remove <code>Envelope Product Set</code> from the view. Your view should now look as follows:</li>

			<p>Adding members to a set is pretty straightforward and can be incredibly helpful when you want to manually update the member set without editing the actual definition of the set.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>Combined Sets</h2>
			<p>You have now created both static and dynamic sets. Individually, these sets work well, but you can also extend Tableau functionality by combining multiple sets to create a combined set. Using combined sets, you can perform additional analysis and compare and contrast multiple sets. When you create a combined set, you create an altogether new set that contains a combination of either all members from both sets, some members that exist in both sets, or a member from one specific set. </p>
			<p>Complete the following exercise to see this in practice. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor365"/>Exercise 11.13: How to Create Combined Sets</h2>
			<p>Your regional manager wants you to create a view of states that are both in <code>Top 20 States by Profits</code> as well as <code>Top 20 States by Sales</code>.

			<p>In this final section on sets, you learned how to use combined sets by walking through an example. The next will explore parameters.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>Parameters</h1>
			<p>Parameters are like variables/placeholders in Tableau, which give the end user the ability to control the view or data that is shown as part of the report. They allow you to customize your view, adding interactivity as well as flexibility to the workbook. Parameters are used to replacing a constant value from the view with more variable/dynamic values, which are controlled by the end user. They can take any data type: strings, integers, floats, dates, or any varchars. They can easily be confused with filters but the major difference between parameters and filters is that, with filters, the data gets filtered from the view so that it only shows for the filtered values, whereas with parameters, the variables only act as a reference. Parameters control the value of the variable created instead of filtering on the data. </p>
			<p>To use parameters in the view, there are four steps that you need to perform:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create the parameters based on the requirements.</li>
				<li>Show the parameter control to the end user, as we do for sets/filters.</li>
				<li>Use the parameters either in the calculated field, filters, or reference lines.</li>
				<li>Use the calculated field, filters, and reference lines in the view.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor367"/>Exercise 11.14: Standard Parameters</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you'll create and use standard parameters. To observe the true essence of Tableau and parameters, you will create a more advanced view that allows your end users to select the dimensions as well as the measures that they want to see in the view. </p>
			<p>In previous chapters, you have given users the ability to filter data, create groups, and create sets on pre-selected dimensions and measures, but you have not yet given users the ability to select/change the dimensions/measures as per their requirements. But there are many instances when stakeholders want the exact same view with different measures/dimensions. So, instead of creating 4-6 different views with different dimensions/measures combinations, letting users choose their own measures and dimensions is a more efficient way of handling the request while limiting clutter. This is the final view you are aiming for:</p>

			<p>You will be creating two parameters in this exercise: one for selecting <code>Measures</code> and one for selecting <code>Dimensions</code>. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">First, create a parameter for selecting <code>Measures</code>. In the <code>Edit Parameter</code> modal window, you have a choice of six data types: <code>Float</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Date</code>, or <code>Date &amp; Time</code>. Since your parameter contains text, use <code>String</code> as the data type. For the <code>Allowable values</code> option, instead of all values, use <code>List</code> so that you can define the options available to the end user selecting the measure.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_96.jpg" alt="Figure 11.96: Data type options in parameter creation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.96: Data type options in parameter creation</p>
			<p>When you select <code>List</code> for <code>Allowable values</code>, you are presented with <code>List of values</code> options. You then have to define your list, which will be the measure names that your users can select. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Manually add <code>Sales</code>, <code>Profit</code>, <code>Discount</code>, and <code>Quantity</code> to <code>List of values</code>. Your <code>Create Parameter</code> window should look something like this:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_97.jpg" alt="Figure 11.97: Adding measure options for the parameter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.97: Adding measure options for the parameter</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Repeat the same steps for <code>Select Your Dimension</code>. The <code>Create Parameter</code> modal window should look something like the following:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_98.jpg" alt="Figure 11.98: Adding a dimension option for the parameter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.98: Adding a dimension option for the parameter</p>
			<p>The next step is to use the created parameter in a calculated field. By default, parameters don't control anything unless you use the parameter either as part of a calculated field, reference lines, or filters. You will be using the calculated field to use the parameter, which acts as a placeholder substitution for dynamically populating the calculated field with the end user's selected measure/dimension.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Create a calculated field now, named <code>Measure Parameter</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_99.jpg" alt="Figure 11.99: Creating a calculated field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.99: Creating a calculated field</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Use the <code>CASE</code> statement so that if the user selects <code>Sales</code> measures in the parameter, your calculated field should show <code>SUM(Sales)</code> in the view. If the user selects <code>Profit</code> measures in the parameter, your calculated field should show <code>SUM(Profit)</code> in the view and so on. Here is the formula for the calculated field:<pre>CASE [Select Your Measure]
WHEN "Sales" THEN SUM([Sales])
WHEN "Profit" THEN SUM([Profit])
WHEN "Discount" THEN AVG([Discount])
WHEN "Quantity" THEN SUM([Quantity])
END</pre></li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.100: Case statement calculated field for the measure parameter</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Repeat the same step for the <code>Dimension Parameter</code> calculated field with the following <code>CASE</code> statement:<pre>CASE [Select Your Dimension]
WHEN "Segment" THEN [Segment]
WHEN "Category" THEN [Category]
WHEN "Sub-Category" THEN [Sub-Category]
WHEN "State" THEN [State]
END</pre></li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.101: Case statement calculated field for Dimension Parameter</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="9">The next step is to create a view with calculated fields as well as using two of our parameters: Drag <code>Dimension Parameter</code> as well as <code>Measure Parameter</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf. Next, drag <code>Order Date</code> to <code>Columns</code> and change the date dimension to <code>Continuous</code> date by quarter. The view that you see is pre-selected based on the <em class="italic">current value</em> that you selected when creating the parameter. You had <code>Sales</code> for the <code>{Select Your Measure}</code> parameter and <code>Segment</code> for the <code>{Select Your Dimension}</code> parameter. So, your current view is the quarterly trend of <code>Sales</code> by <code>Segment</code>. </li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.102: Parameter view with default parameters selected</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="10">The final step is to allow your end users to control the measure as well as the dimension in the view. Right-click on the parameter that you created and click on <code>Show Parameter Control</code>. Repeat the step for the other parameter:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_103.jpg" alt="Figure 11.103: Show Parameter Control&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.103: Show Parameter Control</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="11">Add the parameter control to your view, so that the end users have the ability to choose the dimension/measure of their choice. Here are two views with a different combination of dimensions and measures:</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Profit by Category</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_104.jpg" alt="Figure 11.104 Profit by Category parametric view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.104 Profit by Category parametric view</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Quantity by Segment</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_105.jpg" alt="Figure 11.105: Quantity by Segment parametric view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.105: Quantity by Segment parametric view</p>
			<p>As an end user, it can be confusing to look at different combinations because the line graph or graph view does not show which dimension/measure is part of the view. Though you have the dropdowns, to make it easier for end users, you can also include the callout in your title by creating a dynamic title that is updated along with the dimension in the view. Edit the title by double-clicking on the worksheet title and that opens up the <code>Edit Title</code> window as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_106.jpg" alt="Figure 11.106: Editing the title&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.106: Editing the title</p>
			<p>The preceding formula uses dynamic variables. In particular, <code>&lt;Parameters.Select Your Dimension&gt;</code> is dynamic such that, when you change the parameter from the dropdown in the worksheet, the title will be automatically updated. You don't have to type the exact variable; you can insert these variables by clicking on <code>Insert</code> in the top right-hand corner of the window as shown here:</p>

			<p>In this exercise, you learned what parameters are and how to use them in combination with calculated fields to create a dynamic worksheet where the end users have complete control over which dimension/measures they want the report view to be part of. The skills imparted in this section will go a long way toward growing your advanced knowledge and expertise in Tableau.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>Dynamic Parameters</h2>
			<p>Dynamic parameters was one of the most requested features in the Tableau Community forum, and the Tableau developers shipped the feature in the Tableau 2020.1 version in February 2020. Prior to Tableau version 2020.1, standard parameters had a specific limitation: When the data was updated with new entries (specifically dates), the parameters list/members were not updated. This meant that Tableau authors had to manually refresh the parameter list every time the data source was updated, which, depending on the frequency of the updates, could be very time-consuming. Dynamic parameters overcame that. With these, you can also allow your parameters to automatically choose the most recent date, which wasn't possible previously. Let's explore how this works with the help of an exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Exercise 11.15: Dynamic Parameters</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will be using new dummy data to see what parameters looked like in previous versions of Tableau (2019.4 or earlier). You'll then follow the steps outlined below to use the new parameters to automatically update the parameter list as and when the data source is updated. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A screenshot of the previous version of Tableau has been included; however, you might not have that option. The goal is to communicate the point about static versus dynamic parameters, so you don't need to have two versions of Tableau installed. This exercise will stick with Tableau 2020.1 or later versions.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><code>DynamicParameters.csv</code> file in Tableau. Create a parameter, and set <code>Data type</code> as <code>Date</code> and <code>Allowable values</code> as <code>List</code>, and instead of manually adding these dates, use <code>Add from Field</code> and the <code>Date</code> column to pre-populate the list of values as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_109.jpg" alt="Figure 11.109: Dynamic parameters – adding from a field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.109: Dynamic parameters – adding from a field</p>
			<p>This method, as discussed previously, is pretty static. If new data is added with new dates, the parameter won't automatically pre-populate <code>List of Values</code> to include the new dates as part of the updated data source, which was a limitation in previous versions of Tableau.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2"><code>DynamicParameters.csv</code> file in Tableau, create a parameter, and set <code>Data type</code> as <code>Date</code> and <code>Allowable values</code> as <code>List</code>. Note that, as soon as you select <code>List</code>, unlike previous versions of Tableau, Tableau 2020.1 has two options: <ul><li><code>Fixed</code>: This is where you can pre-populate the list from a field as you did in the previous old date parameter. </li><li> <code>When Workbook Opens</code>: This is dynamic option wherein the list will be pre-populated from the <code>Date</code> field, but instead of a fixed list, the list will get updated whenever new data is updated/added.</li></ul></li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.110: Dynamic parameters in Tableau 2020.1 and above</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">In the preceding screenshot, the last date is 5/2/2020. Open the <code>DynamicParameters.csv</code> spreadsheet in a tool of your choice (non-Tableau) and add a new row, <code>Date: 5/3/2020 and Sales: 80</code>. Save the file as shown here:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.111: CSV data from DynamicParameters.csv</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">To check whether the new date was added or not, close your Tableau workbook (make sure you save it first, though). Then, re-open the workbook and edit <code>New Date Parameter</code> to confirm whether the new date was appended to the list of values in the parameter. As you can see from the following screenshot, May 3, 2020, was automatically added to the list of values in the parameter.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_11_112.jpg" alt="Figure 11.112: Dynamic parameters using When workbook opens&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.112: Dynamic parameters using When workbook opens</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you reviewed the major differences between dynamic parameters and static parameters and saw how dynamic parameters automatically update the list of allowable values alongside the data source update.</p>
			<p>In the last section of this chapter, you will put all you have learned about Tableau's advanced interactivity features into practice with a real-world scenario.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Activity 11.01: Top N Countries Using Parameters, Sets, and Filters</h2>
			<p>As part of the annual hackathon in the company, each team is required to utilize the World Indicators dataset to showcase the top 5 countries according to certain metrics. You decide to show the top N countries by energy usage and also give end users the ability to change the N from 5 to 10, 15, or 20 for ease of use. You will create an interactive view of the World Indicators dataset using sets, context filters, and parameters in this activity. </p>
			<p>By the end of this activity, you will have created an interesting view by utilizing all the major topics covered in this chapter, with a special focus on context filters and end user interactivity.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Connect to the <code>WorldIndicators.hyper</code> dataset downloaded from the project/book folder in Tableau.</li>
				<li>Create a bar chart of <code>Country/Region</code> by <code>Energy Usage</code>.</li>
				<li>Create a <code>Top N Countries</code> parameter with 5, 10, 15, and 20 as list values.</li>
				<li>Create a set called <code>Top N by Energy Usage</code> and use the <code>Top N Countries</code> parameter for user interactivity.</li>
				<li>Drag the <code>Top N by Energy Usage</code> set to the <code>Color</code> <code>Marks</code> shelf.</li>
				<li>Show <code>Year[Year]</code> as a single drop-down filter.</li>
				<li>Make sure the <code>Year</code> filter updates the list of <em class="italic">top N countries</em> by their energy usage. <strong class="bold">Hint</strong>: context filters.</li>
				<li>Make the title dynamic, so when the <code>Top N Countries</code> parameter and the <code>Year</code> filter are updated, the title should appropriately reflect the changes. For example, if the user selects the top 10 countries for the year 2010, the title should be <em class="italic">Top 10 countries by their energy usage for the year 2010</em>.</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter considered a number of advanced interactivity features in Tableau. We looked closely at the order of operations in Tableau, which is one of the most important concepts to master in Tableau if we want to create an efficient report for our stakeholders. We also discussed filters, sets, groups, and hierarchies, covered filters in depth, explored the difference between dimensions, measures, and date filters, and practiced using data source filters, which can be a great way to limit the data being loaded in your view. </p>
			<p>Regarding sets, we reviewed static, dynamic, and combined sets, using the <em class="italic">Envelope</em> example to demo the concepts. In the section on parameters, we also defined the difference between static and dynamic parameters and learned one of the advanced use cases of parameters: dimension/measure swapping, which you can use to give end users the ability to choose the dimension/measures that they want to include in the view. </p>
			<p>We wrapped up the chapter by working through an activity utilizing the World Indicators dataset. Here, you created a complex view using sets, context filters, and parameters, which in a way resembled a real-world scenario that you might face in your data job.</p>
			<p>This concludes the print copy of this book, but it is not the end of your journey.
