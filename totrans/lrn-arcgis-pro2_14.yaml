- en: As you have now experienced firsthand, ArcGIS Pro contains a wealth of tools
    and methods for editing data, creating maps, and performing analysis. In many
    cases, there are two or three different ways to do the same thing. Also, many
    geoprocessing tools are very similar, such as **Union**, **Intersect**, and **Identity**.
    Though these are similar, each is designed to be used in specific circumstances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these different tools and methods make ArcGIS Pro a very powerful application.
    However, it can also make it confusing for the new users and allow experienced
    users to perform functions very differently. This can result in inaccurate or
    just wrong results. Things would be much simpler if you could develop standard
    workflows that everyone could use with step-by-step instructions required to complete
    specific tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With ArcGIS Pro, you can do just that. They are called **tasks**. Tasks provide
    step-by-step workflows that can be saved along with your project. There is no
    limit to the number of tasks you can save with your project. You can save and
    share them to a network folder, ArcGIS Online, Portal for ArcGIS, and more.

    specific process. Tasks can be very simple, containing only three or four steps,
    or they can be very complex, containing group tasks within a task and each group
    can contain multiple steps. It is entirely up to you depending on the purpose
    of the task and the skill level of those that will be using the task. Tasks allow
    you to be as detailed as you believe you need to be for your user audience.

    tasks so that they are easier to find and manage.

    steps. Steps refer to actions, buttons, geoprocessing tools, models, or scripts
    accessible in ArcGIS Pro. A common step would be to use the **Explore** tool to
    zoom to the location of a feature. Another example of a step would be selecting
    a given feature once the user has zoomed to the right area:'

    to show everyone in your organization the proper workflow for splitting a parcel
    so that everyone does it the same way. It might be to develop a workflow for identifying
    all parcels located within 300 feet of another parcel that is to be re-zoned so
    you can create a notification mailing list. Each of these represents a purpose.

    order in which those tools and actions need to be performed to achieve the purpose
    and goal of the task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think through your workflow carefully. Write down each step you believe will
    be required in the task and any tools associated with each step. Once you have
    the steps written down, you should verify you have taken into account all the
    needed steps. It is not unusual for experienced users to forget a step because
    it is something they do automatically without even realizing they do it. This
    means a task may be incomplete or confusing depending on the audience using the
    task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best ways to validate or even develop the initial workflow for a
    task is to work through the entire process manually within ArcGIS Pro. If you
    are validating a workflow, make sure to follow it exactly as you have written
    it down. This will help you to identify any steps you may have missed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following your own instructions will be harder than you think. You will want
    to just do it instinctively, but do not fall into that trap. Make sure you take
    your time and follow the steps as you have outlined them. Remember, others that
    may use the task might not have the same skill level as you do. So, missing a
    tool or step that is intuitive to you may not be to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you work through the process manually to actually develop the steps, then
    record each step as you do it. Make sure to note the tools associated with that
    step. Creating a document with screenshots can also be helpful as you do this.
    That helps ensure you remember all the requirements associated with a given step
    when you go to create the task.

    a common workflow within your organization to ensure everyone is doing it the
    same way; you might want to use it as a training tool for new users; or you may
    want to establish a best practice for your organization to ensure accuracy and
    efficiency.

    of documentation needed for the task. Here are a few examples:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are creating a task that will be used to **train new users**, you will
    need to make sure you include exact step-by-step instructions with very thorough
    documentation on exactly what the user needs to do to complete the step. You will
    want many of the steps to be manually interactive so the user learns the process
    completely and understands the reasons for each step.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are just trying to **establish a common workflow** within an organization
    of experienced users, you can often reduce the number of interactive steps and
    use automatic steps since the users are already familiar with ArcGIS Pro functionality.
    Also, due to that experience level, you can reduce the level of instructional
    documentation required for each step.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to create as they typically require more effort due to the higher level of complexity
    of their design and documentation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another consideration that falls under how the task will be used is the **license
    level** required to perform the steps within a task. Steps often refer to the
    use of specific geoprocessing tools or ArcGIS Pro commands. As you have learned,
    some geoprocessing tools are only available with certain licensing levels or extensions.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as you are developing a task, you need to always consider what skill level,
    license level, and extensions are required to complete a task. If your task makes
    use of tools that require a specific license level or extension, you might want
    to include a step that has the user verify they have the correct license level
    or extension needed to complete the task.

    users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your audience is a group that is familiar with another GIS software application
    such as ArcMap, you might need to include references to tools or processes in
    that application so they can more easily relate ArcGIS Pro functionality to something
    they are familiar with. This may increase the amount of instruction you create
    for each step.
