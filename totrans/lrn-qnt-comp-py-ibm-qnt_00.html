    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="mainHeading">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">Ever since IBM released their first commercially available quantum system for free on the cloud back in 2016, many researchers, developers, faculty, students, and quantum enthusiasts have been running their experiments on real quantum computers. Since then, many in both academia and industry have been investing time and personnel to investigate the potential that quantum computing has in store. The first step in this quantum journey is education, which I assume is why you purchased this book. In this book, you will learn the basic principles of quantum computing and how to leverage those principles to create quantum algorithms and run them on IBM’s powerful quantum computers.</p>
    <p class="normal">This book provides you with a step-by-step introduction to quantum computing using the <strong class="keyWord">IBM Quantum</strong> platform. You will learn how to build quantum programs on your own so you can discover early use cases in your industry or domain and get equipped with quantum computing skills.</p>
    <p class="normal">You will start working with simple programs that illustrate how these quantum computing principles differ from classical computing and slowly work your way up to more complex programs and algorithms that leverage advanced quantum computing algorithms.</p>
    <p class="normal">The quantum computing principles we will explore are superposition, entanglement, and interference, then you’ll become familiar on how these are used to create quantum circuits, which you can then run on IBM Quantum systems.</p>
    <p class="normal">Then, you’ll learn about the quantum gates and how they operate on qubits and discover the <strong class="keyWord">Quantum Information Science Kit</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">QISKIT</strong>, depending on who you ask, is pronounced KISS-kit) and its circuit libraries and advanced features to help you build quantum algorithms.</p>
    <p class="normal">You’ll then get to grips with quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Grover, and Shor’s algorithms, while visualizing how to create a quantum circuit and run the algorithm on any of the quantum computers hosted on the IBM Quantum platform.</p>
    <p class="normal">Later, you’ll explore the basics on how your circuit is run on the quantum hardware by learning about the Qiskit Runtime, which has many functionalities to help optimize your quantum circuits.</p>
    <p class="normal">By the end of this book, you’ll have learned how to build quantum programs on your own and will have gained practical quantum computing skills that you can apply to your industry or domain.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading-1">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is for Python developers who are interested in learning about quantum computing and expanding their abilities to solve classically intractable problems with the help of Qiskit. Some background in computer science and Python is required. While a background in physics and linear algebra is suggested, it is not entirely required.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="heading-1">What this book covers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the IBM Quantum Tools</em>, will introduce you to all the tools available to you on the IBM Quantum platform. These tools will help you get up and running quickly and easily without having to install or purchase anything.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Creating Quantum Circuits with IBM Quantum Composer</em>, discusses this easy-to-use user interface, which is a great tool for visualizing how the various quantum gates and operations affect each qubit and help build an intuitive understanding of the differences between classical and quantum computing.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Introducing and Installing Qiskit</em>, explores the <strong class="keyWord">Quantum Information Science Kit</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Qiskit</strong>) and its advanced features to develop and implement various quantum algorithms, and noise models. Qiskit has various features that help you build quantum circuits, algorithms, and applications easily and allows you to run them on local simulators and real quantum systems.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding Basic Quantum Computing Principles</em>, begins our quantum journey by discussing the basic quantum computing principles of superposition, entanglement, and interference, which are used by many quantum algorithms. This will also help you understand what differentiates quantum computing from classical computing.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Qubit</em>, covers what the quantum bit, or qubit, is and how you can manipulate it on a quantum system using the various gates and operators, and how to visualize the results of those operations.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding Quantum Logic Gates</em>, takes a deeper look at the various quantum gates and operations used to change the state of the qubits and your quantum circuit.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Programming with Qiskit</em>, is where we start digging into creating quantum circuits using the quantum gates and operations we’ve learned about so far. You will also learn how these gates and operations are converted into microwave pulse schedules, which are what is used to manipulate the qubits on the quantum system.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Optimizing and Visualizing Quantum Circuits</em>, discusses sending the instructions from your quantum program to run on a quantum system, which has some interesting work happening in the background. Which qubits are the best for running your circuit? Which connections should we select between the qubits that minimizes the number of gates? All these are taken care of by the preset pass manager generator, which we will cover in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Simulating Quantum Systems and Noise Models</em>, explains that all quantum systems, no matter the technology used to create them, must deal with the issue of noise. In this chapter, you will learn what these noises are and how to create models that simulate them to better understand the effects they have on your quantum circuit.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Suppressing and Mitigating Quantum Noise</em>, explains how to mitigate the various effects noise has on a quantum system.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding Quantum Algorithms</em>, takes a deep look at the basic quantum algorithms to help understand how the quantum computing principles of superposition, entanglement, and interference are used. We will also review and code some fundamental concepts and algorithms which will help us understand the more complex algorithms. </p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Applying Quantum Algorithms</em>, takes you through applying the quantum computing principles and concepts that we’ve learned about to some complex quantum algorithms.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding Quantum Utility and Qiskit Patterns</em>, covers what quantum utility is and why it is the key to getting us closer towards quantum advantage. It will also provide an overview of the Qiskit patterns and how they can simplify your development experience to build complex quantum circuits.</p>
