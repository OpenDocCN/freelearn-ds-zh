<p>0In this chapter, we will be creating maps using QGIS. We will use the styling and the data from the previous chapter. We will look at labeling features, before building a map using the data. QGIS is very good at creating maps. Have a look at this gallery to get an idea of the capabilities of QGIS: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis/pool/">https://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis/pool/</a>.</p>
<p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labeling</li>
<li>Creating maps</li>
<li>Saving and exporting maps</li>
<li>Creating an Atlas</li>
<li>Building a web map</li>
</ul>

<p>Open the QGIS project we built in <a href="e8289aa4-8eb7-4d2d-9662-4c17889a53e3.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Styling Data</em>. We will be using it to build a map. Turn on the <span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span> by selecting <span class="packt_screen">View</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Toolbars</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span>. <span><span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span></span> is shown as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6f78000c-93ef-4c4f-a4f0-831b0579d2eb.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Labeling toolbar</div>
<p>There are eight buttons on this toolbar; in order, these are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on <span>Layer Labeling Options</span> will open the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Styling</span> Panel and the label tab by default</li>
<li>Layer Diagram Options</li>
<li>Highlight Pinned Labels and Diagrams</li>
<li>Pin/Unpin Labels And Diagrams</li>
<li>Show/Hide Labels And Diagrams</li>
<li>Move Label and Diagram</li>
<li>Rotate Label </li>
<li>Change Label, used for label editing</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that the <kbd>Airports</kbd> layer is selected in the <span class="packt_screen">Layers</span> panel. Click on the layer labeling button on <span><span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span></span>. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Styling</span> Panel; we used this in the previous chapter to style our layers. Choose <span class="packt_screen">Single labels</span> and the label with <span class="packt_screen">NAME</span> to label all <kbd>Airports</kbd>. I have reduced the <span class="packt_screen">Size</span> of the text from <span class="packt_screen">10.0000</span> to <span class="packt_screen">8.0000</span> points. Make sure that the checkbox next to <span class="packt_screen">Live update</span> is ticked so any updates can be seen as they are made. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f1c61a11-c4bb-4c86-ac38-cf9e4689cc64.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Layer Styling Panel—label design focus</div>
<p>These are the default labeling options. Any changes you make will be instantly seen in the map. Not all labels will be placed perfectly. A good method is to try to get as many labels in the best location possible using the <span class="packt_screen">Placement</span> tab, and then manually move individual labels if they are still not located optimally.</p>
<p>With the labels tab open, select the <span class="packt_screen">Placement</span> tab (the icon with four arrows pointing north, south, east, and west). Choose the radio button next to <span class="packt_screen">Offset from point</span> and click the top middle quadrant in the display. This will move all the labels directly north (as you view your map) from the <kbd>Airports</kbd> icon. Adjust <span class="packt_screen">Offset X,Y</span> to <span class="packt_screen">0.0000</span>,<span class="packt_screen">-2.0000</span> to exaggerate the distance from the icon. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/87eaec75-c348-4e01-8f96-8f5a955e52aa.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Layer Styling Panel—label Placement focus</div>
<p>Now that we have placed the labels, let's style them using some of the options available to us. Click on the buffer tab (the icon shows abc with a blue background). Next, check the box next to <span class="packt_screen">Draw text buffer</span>. This helps our labels stand out more from the map. Click on the customize effects button, check the box next to <span class="packt_screen">Drop Shadow</span>, and set its <span class="packt_screen">Opacity</span> to <span class="packt_screen">50.0%</span>. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/020af032-6c98-41cf-bcec-fc7bff74bb5e.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Layer Styling Panel<span>—</span>label Effects Properties</div>
<p>The map now looks like this:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Map with layers added</div>
<p>As you can see, there is an issue with labels near the Anchorage International Airport. Let's use the interactive <span><span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span></span> to move these labels manually. There are still some labels not being displayed; in the next section, we will move them manually.</p>

<p>To interactively move a label, click on the Move Label and Diagram button on <span><span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span></span> and accept ID as the primary key. Next, click on a label and move it. As you click and drag a label, a placement box appears in green where the new location of the label will be. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2d855b71-2b8a-412b-ab1b-7a18a4d07fed.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Placing labels</div>
<p>Keep zooming in and out of the map to ensure your labels are placed where best suited to your data. You have many other options that we will not cover in this quick start guide, but rotating (as shown highlighted on <span><span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span></span> as follows) is useful, especially on linear features:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e67a486e-4785-4ded-874f-8573e0c8daf9.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Label Toolbar</div>
<p>The final button on the right of <span><span class="packt_screen">Label Toolbar</span></span> allows you to change the individual properties of one label at a time; size, color, and font size can all be set on a label-by-label basis. Your map will look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e1204908-3286-4949-9015-89e3f1fb090f.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Label placement with adjustment</div>
<p>If you wanted to label rivers and the grassland areas, apply labels using the same tool we have just described.</p>
<p>We are now ready to bring this all together and make a map.</p>

<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New Print Layout</span> (or click the corresponding button on <span class="packt_screen">Project Toolbar</span>).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Create print layout Title</span> dialog box (shown as follows), give your new, empty map a title and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1326570d-a2db-44b4-a270-a39cdb489ebf.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Creating a new print layout</div>
<p>You will now have an empty canvas on which we will build our map. Add your map to the layout canvas via the menu by going to <span class="packt_screen">Add Item</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add Map</span>. Then, click and drag the mouse to draw on the canvas in the location you want to put your map. This will add an <span class="packt_screen">Item</span> called <span class="packt_screen">Map 1</span>; we will add more items later. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b3b79f56-e1b7-4234-8cb4-59ca56f33db3.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Map layout</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">Please note that for ease of reading this book, the label size has been increased.<br/>
For this reason you will find that the screen shots are slightly different to your screen.</div>
<p>With <span class="packt_screen">Map 1</span> selected, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span> tab and set the scale to <kbd>12000000</kbd>, as this will display all our data on the page. Ensure that <span class="packt_screen">Toolbox Toolbar</span> is enabled (<span class="packt_screen">View</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Toolbars</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Toolbox</span>). This is a very useful toolbar as it allow us to design our page. Click on the Move Item Content button, highlighted as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9d962782-3226-4687-829e-0b4a72a8e638.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Move item button—used to move an item on the map</div>
<p>This tool allows us to move the data in the map around so it best fits the page. When you are happy it is in the right place, click on Pan Map (the hand icon).</p>
<p>To add a legend, click on the add legend button. Draw an area where the legend will appear on the map. The legend may appear messy at first, but we can adjust it in <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span>. Make sure that the legend is selected in the <span class="packt_screen">Items</span> panel, and then from the <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span> tab add a title (<span class="packt_screen">Legend</span>) and uncheck the auto update checkbox. We can remove any layers appearing in the legend that we don't want. In the map, the <kbd>Hillshade</kbd> and <kbd>landcover</kbd> rasters are still there. To remove these, click on the layer name and then click on the red minus button to remove it from the legend. If you wanted to add a layer back, then click on the green cross to bring up a list of layers to select. To finish the legend, scroll down <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span> and expand <span class="packt_screen">Fonts</span>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Here, set <span class="packt_screen">Title font</span> to bold. The map now looks like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ed16881b-5384-4040-be1f-4b31e9c30197.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Map layout with Legend added</div>
<p>Next, add a scalebar. In <span class="packt_screen">Toolbox</span> <span class="packt_screen">Toolbar</span>, select the scalebar tool and click and drag a new scalebar to the lower-right corner of the map. In <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span> for the scalebar, set <span class="packt_screen">Style</span> as <span class="packt_screen">Double Box</span> and the units to <span class="packt_screen">Miles</span>. Change the <span class="packt_screen">Label for units</span> value from <span class="packt_screen">mi</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Miles</span>.</p>
<p>Add a north arrow by clicking <span class="packt_screen">Add Item</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add </span><span class="packt_screen">Picture</span> and draw a box to contain your north arrow. Use the item properties of the north arrow to point to the location on your computer where the QGIS SVG files are stored. In this example, I am using <kbd>C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\svg\arrows/NorthArrow_11.svg</kbd>.</p>
<p>Now, we need to add a title and a description. To add text to this map, select <span class="packt_screen">Add Item</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Add label</span>. Draw a box in the lower-left corner, and in the <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span> window, copy the following text:</p>
<pre style="margin: 0in;margin-bottom: .0001pt">&lt;h1&gt;A QGIS built map of Alaska&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>&lt;h2&gt;This map was created in QGIS 3.4&lt;/h2&gt;<br/>&lt;p&gt;We used the following data&lt;/p&gt;<br/>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airports&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;Grassland&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;Rivers&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;Alaska boundary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Render as HTML</span>.</p>
<p>To finish, we can set a background color for the map. Select <span class="packt_screen">Map 1</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Items</span> panel and scroll to the background options in the <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span>. Choose a neutral color; I have selected a light gray. Adjust the transparency to a suitable level so it doesn't distract the viewer. Select the legend in the <span class="packt_screen">Items</span> panel and set the background to the same color as the map background.</p>
<p>Finally, from the <span class="packt_screen">Toolbox</span> <span class="packt_screen">Toolbar</span>, click on the Add Shape icon. Choose a rectangle and draw around the title. Select it as the item and, in <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span>, change the fill to no fill and the boarder to black (it will be black by default). Then, set <span class="packt_screen">Corner radius</span> to <span class="packt_screen">3.00</span>, so the corners are rounded in the textbox.</p>
<p>Your map will look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e767821a-70ec-4858-a140-bc9fa3b80967.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Map layout updated in QGIS 3.4</div>
<p>Save your map via <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Save Project</span>. To save it as <kbd>.pdf</kbd>, click <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Export as pdf</span>. You may need to adjust the export settings, such as dpi values, to make the optimal map output. To do this, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> tab on the right of the screen (next to <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span>). On this screen, you will have the option to change a variety of settings. The <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> tab is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating an Atlas</h1>
                </header>

<p>Close the layout we have just created and return to the QGIS main project screen. In this example, we are going to create an Atlas of maps of the locations around civilian airports. To do this, use the <span class="packt_screen">NAME</span> <span>field,</span><span> </span><span>which contains only civilian airports. Let's create a new basic layout to show this functionality. We can do this by selecting</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">New Print Layout</span><span>, or via</span> <span class="packt_screen">Layout Manager Project</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Layout Manager</span><span>. Let's choose <span class="packt_screen">Layout Manager</span>. This is a useful dialog box that lists all of our created layouts within a QGIS project. It is shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/72d23729-e6ba-4b74-b7cc-b5d69a7e3a40.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">QGIS Layout Manager</div>
<p>Select <span class="packt_screen">Empty layout</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> to open a new blank template. I am going to call my new layout <kbd>Airport_Atlas</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/88fa9dff-c9d3-4e9b-92ce-f6f16258ca3f.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Create a new print layout</div>
<p>As we did when creating the Alaska map, select the add new map to layout button, and click and drag to fill the map page with the data from the QGIS project. From the menu bar, select <span class="packt_screen">Atlas</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Atlas settings</span> and then check the box next to <span class="packt_screen">Generate an atlas</span>. Now, select <span class="packt_screen">Coverage layer</span> as <kbd>Airports</kbd> and <span class="packt_screen">Page name</span> as <span class="packt_screen">NAME</span>. This will tell the Atlas to create one page per airport name:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f083490d-550b-429f-a9df-ba064f5dcd96.png" style=""/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Options for generating an Atlas</div>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Item Properties</span> tab, make sure that <span class="packt_screen">Controlled by atlas</span> is checked; this will mean the scale/view will adjust to each feature. Next, ensure that the <span class="packt_screen">Atlas</span> toolbar is turned on. The toolbar is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e6203dc3-dfe5-404e-add3-e867d2ee96e4.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Atlas toolbar</div>
<p>Click on the preview button in the <span class="packt_screen">Atlas</span> toolbar and use the arrows to scroll through the proposed Atlas. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/df0c5b09-b483-4783-84c7-efcaef8ac76b.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Map created in the Atlas function</div>
<p>The scale may need adjusting to suit your needs. You can add a title, legend, scale bar, and north arrow as we did in the previous example. Once you have finished, select <span class="packt_screen">Atlas</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Export Atlas</span> from the menu as <kbd>.pdf</kbd> and save to disk. This is a simple example, but it shows the basics of creating an Atlas; you only need to build one layout to do it. Save and close your layout when finished.</p>
<p>Finally, in this chapter, we will have a quick look at creating a map for the web.</p>

<p>We can do more than just create printed or static digital maps. By creating a web map, a user has the ability to have more interaction with a map online. QGIS has a plugin that will allow you to display your data as a web map. This provides another option for sharing your maps. In this brief example, we will introduce QGIS plugins and how the <kbd>qgis2web</kbd> <span>plugin</span><span> </span><span>allows us to create web maps.</span></p>
<p>Plugins are a really powerful and collaborative feature of QGIS. Developers and companies have created many plugins that extend the core features of QGIS. Some have been so integral to workflows that they have been incorporated into the main software. From the <span class="packt_screen">Plugins</span> menu, select <span class="packt_screen">M<span class="packt_screen">anage and Install</span> Plugins</span>.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">We will look at plugins more in the following two chapters, <a href="6cd8f808-67bd-4788-8e7a-ccd3ce12a11d.xhtml"/><a href="6cd8f808-67bd-4788-8e7a-ccd3ce12a11d.xhtml"/><a href="6cd8f808-67bd-4788-8e7a-ccd3ce12a11d.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Spatial Processing</em> and <a href="bab7139e-9f38-4dff-b1eb-c5056be9c960.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Expanding QGIS 3</em>.</div>
<p>From the plugin manager, with the <span class="packt_screen">ALL</span> tab selected, search for and install <kbd>qgis2web</kbd>. Once installed, close the plugin manager. In the menu, there should be an option called <span class="packt_screen">Web</span>. From here, select <span class="packt_screen">qgis2web</span> | <span class="packt_screen">create web map</span>. Adjust <span class="packt_screen">Layers and Groups</span> to match the map you wish to create. In this example, <kbd>Airports</kbd>, <kbd>majrivers</kbd>, and <kbd>alaska</kbd> layers are selected. This map will use the <kbd>Leaflet</kbd> JavaScript library; this is a library designed to create lightweight web maps. A screenshot of <span class="packt_screen">qgis2web</span> follows:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The overview of qgis2web plugin for QGIS</div>
<p>When you are happy with the configuration, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Export</span> button; this will save the web map at the location specified as the <kbd>Export</kbd> folder. Then, open the resulting web map in your web browser. You can copy the contents in the <kbd>Export</kbd> folder to a web server to publish the map. The <kbd><span>qgis2web</span></kbd> plugin is a very efficient way of creating web maps.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have built maps with QGIS. We first looked at labeling options, both with rules and then interactively changing individual labels. Then, we built a map using the data we styled in the previous chapter. We then looked at how to create an Atlas, before finally looking at options to export the map to the web using the <kbd>qgis2web</kbd> plugin.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at spatial analysis, helping to derive more detailed spatial information about data. </p>
