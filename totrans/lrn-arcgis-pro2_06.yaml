    grows. With the infrastructure of modern urban areas expanding both up and down
    as well as outward, the importance of seeing what is above and below the ground
    is becoming critical to planning new projects, responding to emergencies, and
    managing the infrastructure.

    This is certainly true when working in a Scene. Scenes take a lot of computer

    need to be concerned about. You first need to define a ground elevation. The ground
    elevation provides a baseline for your Scene and is the canvas many other layers

    the elevations of your 3D features. You will often find two elevations used for
    your 3D features, the first being the starting or base elevation, and the second
    being the height or depth of the features. These may be directly related to the
    ground or at an absolute elevation.

    within the 3D Scene you are creating. Each Scene should have a ground surface
    specified. By default, ArcGIS Pro uses the Esri World Elevation surface, which
    is published through **ArcGIS Online**. Don't worry though, as using this surface
    from ArcGIS Online does not use any of your ArcGIS Online credits. This surface,
    as with the **ArcGIS Online Basemaps** surface, is completely free to use.

    height of the light poles used in the city is 18 feet. Before you can set the
    height for the light poles, you will need to make one more change to the project
    settings. By default, 3D symbols use meters as the unit for specifying height.
    You need to change this in project options to feet.

    data in 3D. This opens new levels of understanding, using your GIS data. You have
    learned how you can create different Scenes to support different spatial extents.

- en: You have also learned how you can use different methods to turn 2D data into
    3D features, using extrusion or 3D symbol styles. When using extrusion, you can
    illustrate the true height of features using one of four methods supported in
    ArcGIS Pro. Now, you can use 3D symbols to add a level of visual realism to your
    Scenes.

- en: The key element to creating a 3D Scene is to define a ground surface. You learned
    that you can use the default Esri-provided World Elevation surface or one of your
    own. You are now able to use one of your own surfaces—this can be a DEM or a TIN.
    Using your own ground surface can increase the accuracy of the elevation data
    within your Scene and the relationships between features along the *z* axis.
