    a series of nodes and lines that form a network of adjacent triangles. The triangles

    file size to an equivalent DEM. However, due to their complexity, they can take
    much longer to draw or process when used in the analysis. It is strongly recommended
    that you ensure your computer has a dedicated graphics card if you will be working
    with TINs when using ArcGIS Pro.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being vector-based, TINs can be created from a range of input data such as streams,
    ridgelines, roads, and so on. When the TIN is generated, these input features
    will remain in the same location and be matched with nodes or edges within the
    TIN. This can allow the TIN to achieve a high degree of accuracy and detail that
    is not normally possible with a DEM.
