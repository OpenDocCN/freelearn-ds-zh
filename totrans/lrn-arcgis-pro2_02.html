                    Introducing ArcGIS Pro
                </header>
      <article>
        <p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="KeyWordPACKT">Esri's ArcGIS platform</span> has become well-entrenched as the primary solution for GIS professionals seeking to implement a scalable integrated solution, which can start with a single user and grow to support multiple users across various platforms. With <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcGIS Desktop</span></strong>, <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcGIS Enterprise</span></strong>, <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcGIS Online</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcGIS Apps</span></strong>, <strong>Geographic Information System</strong> (<strong>GIS</strong>) professionals can design and implement a robust GIS solution that provides a wide range of functionality to meet the needs of a growing enterprise, which includes users of various skill levels, requirements, differing platforms, and data formats. However, Esri has not been content to rest on their laurels. They continue to push the GIS envelope. </p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">In 2015, Esri released a new desktop GIS application named <span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcGIS Pro</span>. ArcGIS Pro has replaced ArcMap and ArcCatalog as the flagship desktop GIS application in Esri's solution stack. Those are not the only applications ArcGIS Pro has replaced. It has also replaced the ArcScene and ArcGlobe applications for 3D data viewing and analysis.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">ArcGIS Pro is a completely new application from Esri. It is not just an update to their venerable ArcGIS Desktop platform. ArcGIS Pro has a modern ribbon interface that has become common in most current desktop applications. It is also designed from the ground up to take full advantage of modern hyperthreaded 64-bit architecture. This greatly improves its performance compared to the older applications it is replacing. In this chapter, we will begin to take a look at this new robust and smart interface.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">ArcGIS Pro also introduces a new licensing model to Esri users. While it still supports the traditional Single Use and <strong>Concurrent Use</strong> license models of previous applications, at least for now, it defaults to the use of a subscription-based named user license model. This new license model requires you to manage your licenses through ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise Portal. You will learn more about this later in the chapter.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">ArcGIS Pro allows you to combine 2D and 3D content within a single application. In the past, you would need to utilize multiple applications, such as <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcMap</span></strong>, <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcScene</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">ArcGlobe</span></strong>, to view 2D and 3D content. In this chapter, you will examine how you can view both 2D and 3D data within a single ArcGIS Pro project.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">Here, the following topics will be covered:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checking requirements for installing ArcGIS Pro</li>
          <li>Downloading and installing ArcGIS Pro</li>
          <li>Managing and assigning ArcGIS Pro licenses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have completed this chapter, you will be able to successfully install ArcGIS Pro on your computer, know whether your computer is capable of running the application, assign yourself and other users licenses to use ArcGIS Pro, and open an ArcGIS Pro project. </p>
        <h1 id="uuid-a63b5604-3b5e-43f9-a908-7e30564725b0">Technical requirements</h1>
        <p>To successfully complete this chapter, you will require the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Internet access</li>
          <li><strong>ArcGIS Pro 2.6</strong>—<strong>Basic</strong> or a higher license</li>
          <li>Sample data downloaded and installed for this book</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="uuid-9ce513d6-8346-45f3-82ac-79cb912d47f3">Checking requirements for installing ArcGIS Pro</h1>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">In order to use ArcGIS Pro, you must first install it. To install ArcGIS Pro, you will need to verify that your system meets or exceeds the minimum requirements. You will then need to download or have access to the installed files, and finally, have the rights to install the software on the computer you are using. We will look at each of these steps next.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">It is possible to install and run ArcGIS Pro on a computer that already has ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap and ArcCatalog) installed even if ArcGIS Desktop is an older version. The two applications may exist side by side or on separate computers. These are completely separate, independent installations.</p>
        <p>In the following sections, you will learn the ArcGIS Pro system requirements, how to download the installation files, and how to install ArcGIS Pro on your computer. </p>
        <h2 id="uuid-87400cc4-5fd8-4431-bd56-c15e91c6d8d1">Understanding ArcGIS Pro minimum system requirements</h2>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">As mentioned earlier, ArcGIS Pro is a 64-bit application that supports hyperthreaded processing. This allows ArcGIS Pro to take full advantage of modern processors, such as the <strong><span class="KeyWordPACKT">Intel Core i7</span></strong> or <strong>AMD Ryzen</strong> and <strong>Random Access Memory</strong> (<strong>RAM</strong>) larger than 4 GB. The ability of ArcGIS Pro to make use of this increased computing capability means it typically completes tasks much faster than the older applications it is replacing.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">However, this ability to use modern computer hardware does come at a price. Compared with the older ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Pro has much higher minimum computer specifications. This includes increased hardware and OS requirements as well as supporting application requirements. This means that just because your current computer is able to run applications such as ArcMap, it will not necessarily be able to successfully run ArcGIS Pro. It is important to verify that your computer meets or exceeds the recommended minimum specification if you want your experience using ArcGIS Pro to be positive and not frustrating.</p>
        <p>At the following link, you will find the minimum requirements for the current version of ArcGIS Pro, <strong>2.6</strong>. These do change with new releases, so make sure to verify them based on the release you will be using. You can find the most current system requirements here: <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm">https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm</a></p>
        <h2 id="uuid-9103980e-66c5-40de-96ab-3ff44e104444">Learning about OS requirements</h2>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro requires a 64-bit <strong>operating</strong><strong>system</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>). It will not run on a 32-bit OS. ArcGIS Pro currently supports the following operating systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windows 10 Home</strong>, <strong>Pro</strong>, and <strong>Enterprise</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Windows 8.1 Pro</strong> and <strong>Enterprise</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Windows Server 2019 Standard</strong> and <strong>Datacenter</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Windows Server 2016 Standard</strong> and <strong>Datacenter</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard</strong> and <strong>Datacenter</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Windows Server 2012 Standard</strong> and <strong>Datacenter</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Esri dropped support for <strong>Windows 7</strong> and <strong>Server 2008 R2</strong> after January 2020. They made this move because Microsoft ended their support for those operating systems. This means it might still be possible to run ArcGIS Pro on these operating systems, but neither Esri nor Microsoft will provide you with support if you encounter any problems. It also means that neither company will be providing patches or updates to fix security vulnerabilities or bugs in either of those operating systems. Consequently, it is recommended that you upgrade to a newer OS if you are still running on one of the unsupported ones. </p>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro iscurrently not supported on <strong>Linux</strong> or <strong>iOS</strong> natively. Given Esri's current support for Linux with their ArcGIS Enterprise solution, it is possible ArcGIS Pro may be adapted to run on that platform sometime in the distant future. However, Esri has indicated that ArcGIS Pro will not be ported to run on the iOS platform. This seems to be due to their user base.</p>
        <p>A large majority of ArcGIS users work in government, which typically runs Windows-based computers, and to get an Apple computer requires special procurement processes. As a result, ArcGIS Pro will not be supported on iOS. It is possible to run ArcGIS Pro on a Linux or iOS computer if you create a virtual Windows machine, set up a dual Windows boot, or run a Windows emulator.</p>
        <p>I have actually heard some users claim that ArcGIS Pro actually runs better on an Apple computer that boots into Windows than on a traditional Windows-based computer. I have not tested that claim so I cannot verify, but I do know I have seen many Esri employees using Apple computers, so there might be some truth to the claim.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-e65efd1b-1626-4926-8e56-49300a80852c">Understanding the hardware requirements</h2>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro has some hefty hardware requirements. It requires modern processors and large amounts of RAM. It also requires a graphics card powerful enough to display 2D and 3D data. To ensure that ArcGIS Pro runs smoothly, you need to make sure that your computer meets or exceeds the requirements shown here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>hyperthreaded dual-core</strong>. A 4 core processor is recommended with a 10 core or more processor being optional, such as the <strong>Intel Core i9-10900</strong> or <strong>AMD Ryzen 9 3900</strong>.</li>
          <li>A minimum of 4 GB of RAM with 8 GB of RAM is recommended. 16 GB is considered optimal by Esri.</li>
          <li>A minimum of 32 GB of hard disk space to install the software. A solid-state drive is recommended.</li>
          <li>A graphics card that supports <strong>DirectX 11</strong> and <strong>OpenGL 4.3</strong> with 4 GB of video RAM minimum. Esri recommends a graphics card that supports DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.5 with 4 GB or more of dedicated video RAM.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unlike ArcGIS Desktop, which has limits on the amount of RAM and processor resources it can use, ArcGIS Pro will use all the resources you can throw at it. So, the more processing power and memory your computer has, the better ArcGIS Pro will perform.</p>
        <p>If you are not able to get a dedicated video card and are forced to use integrated video, then it is highly recommended that you increase the amount of RAM and level of your processor to compensate for the shared usage of both to run both the display and the software.</p>
        <p>Ultimately I strongly recommend getting the dedicated graphics card. While this is not cheap, you will experience fewer issues and crashes if you have one. This, in turn, means you will be more productive, less frustrated and have less chance of your data getting corrupted. Over time, the dedicated graphics card will pay for itself as a result of the improved performance.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-32b83212-99e1-4b65-97fc-5c17e18a85de">Other supporting software requirements</h2>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro is dependent on other applications that must be installed prior to installation. They provide supporting services that ArcGIS Pro relies on to function. These supporting applications include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8</strong> or later</li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft Internet Explorer 11</strong> or above</li>
          <li>ArcGIS Online organizational account or ArcGIS Enterprise Portal – this is required if using Named User licensing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these are required for ArcGIS Pro to run successfully, the actual ArcGIS Pro install routine does not verify or check for these. It will install without them and indicate that the installation was successful. However, when you run the application, you will begin to experience problems. This might include the application not starting, the inability to access a license, frequent crashes, and more. </p>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro does not require ArcGIS Desktop in order to be installed on a computer. They are two separate applications that are completely independent of one another. This means they can co-exist on the same computer or be installed individually.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-ad1f9eb2-d700-4c55-a612-0f86438826e4">Author system recommendations</h2>
        <p>I have been working with ArcGIS Pro since it was first released in beta. This has provided the opportunity to run it on various computers as it has moved through multiple beta versions to the release of version 2.6. This firsthand experience, along with my experience running ArcGIS Desktop since it was first released, has led me to several recommendations when it comes to selecting a system to run ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <p>Based on my experience, I recommend the following specifications when purchasing a computer to run ArcGIS Pro:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure that you have a separate graphics card. This will include a dedicated <strong>Graphics Processing Unit</strong> (<strong>GPU</strong>) and <strong>Dedicated Video RAM</strong> (<strong>VRAM</strong>). ArcGIS Pro is a graphics-intensive program. Every time you pan, zoom, or add a new layer, you will be taxing the graphics capability of your computer. A video card will allow your computer to handle this load by processing graphics rendering requests without burdening your computer's CPU and system RAM. If your computer uses integrated video, then the computer's CPU and system RAM are used to handle all processing requests, including graphics rendering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">ArcGIS Pro is both a processor and graphics-intensive application due to the 2D and 3D maps it creates and the analysis it performs. This can put a tremendous load on your computer's resources. Having the dedicated GPU to handle the graphics rendering load on your computer will greatly improve the performance of ArcGIS Pro and your user experience.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">I recommend getting a video card that has at least 6 GB of VRAM. I have had good success using video cards with <strong>NVIDIA</strong> GPUs. Currently, I am running a <strong>GeForce RTX 2070 Super</strong>. It has performed very well and is not too expensive, being around $550 at the time of writing this book. AMD video cards have been a bit lackluster until the recent release of their new <strong>Radeon RX 5700 series</strong>. This new card from AMD has been matching or beating NVDIA's performance in most benchmarks, so this might be worth trying as well, especially since it is a little less expensive for the same (or better) overall performance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a solid-state drive. Solid-state drives are incredibly fast at accessing and storing data. They are almost as fast as RAM and are much faster than even the fastest hard disk drives. ArcGIS Pro will run at lightning speeds when installed on a solid-state drive. This is even truer if you can get a <strong>Non-Volatile Memory Express</strong> (<strong>NVMe</strong>) <strong>M.2 PCIe drive</strong>. These are small drives that look more like a memory stick than a hard drive, but have much greater performance than even traditional <strong>Serial Advanced Technology Attachment</strong> (<strong>SATA</strong>) solid-state drives. This is what I am using in my current workstation.</li>
          <li>There is no such thing as too much RAM. The more RAM your computer has, the better ArcGIS Pro will perform, especially if you don't have a solid-state drive. For anyone doing any heavy lifting with ArcGIS Pro, I would not consider running any less than 16 GB of RAM. I am currently running 32 GB of fast <strong>DDR 4 3000 RAM</strong> on my GIS workstation computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">It performs well for most operations I perform on what I consider small to mid-sized datasets. If you are going to be working with <strong>Light Detection and Ranging</strong> (<strong>LiDAR</strong>), <strong>Raster</strong>, or 3D data, I would encourage having more than 16 GB of RAM. However, if you are working primarily with vector data in mostly a 2D environment, 16 GB of RAM appears to be the optimum spot between performance and cost. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are forced to use standard mechanical hard drives, then make sure they are 7,200 RPM or faster, and not 5,400 RPM drives. The seek times on the slower drives are just too slow to efficiently support effective GIS operations.</li>
          <li>If you are going to be doing a lot of analysis or editing and cannot get a solid-state drive, try using a <strong>Redundant Array of Independent Disks</strong> (<strong>RAID</strong>) system to improve performance. RAID systems utilize multiple hard drives to store data. They can be configured in multiple ways. A strip set-based RAID, such as <strong>RAID 0</strong>, <strong>RAID 3</strong>, or <strong>RAID 5</strong>, provides the best performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">By storing the data across multiple drives, the computer can access the requested data from each one at the same time. This creates a multilane highway for your data to travel along. A RAID system will require at least two hard drives and often a separate controller card. Multiple solid-state drives can also be put into a RAID for increased performance if desired. However, for all but the largest datasets, I would say that would be overkill in most cases. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Run two or more monitors. ArcGIS Pro, like ArcGIS Desktop, has multiple windows. Being able to display multiple windows at one time will increase your production. It can also allow you to have multiple applications open at one time. While I have not attempted to measure the increased production with ArcGIS Pro, I do know that it increased the production of my team using ArcGIS Desktop by 10–15%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these recommendations can also be applied to other applications as well, such as ArcGIS Desktop, <strong>AutoCAD</strong>, <strong>MicroStation</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, and other graphics-intensive applications. I have run all these applications and can say that based on those experiences, any of these recommendations will help them run better.</p>
        <p>You might want to watch the YouTube video I have made on these recommendations: <a href="https://youtu.be/tH7JemkC7SM">https://youtu.be/tH7JemkC7SM</a>. You can also see the build for my current GIS computer, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPXRqpqzHaQ">https://youtu.be/GPXRqpqzHaQ</a>, so you can see the system I use to run ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-3ce039ac-dd49-4964-81ac-290424123f3c">Testing to see whether your computer can run ArcGIS Pro</h2>
        <p>Before you attempt to install ArcGIS Pro, it is a good idea to test your system first to see whether it meets or exceeds the minimum requirements for installing the application. Luckily, Esri has a tool that can test your system. Let's run that tool now to check your computer:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You will start by opening your web browser, such as <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Firefox</strong>, <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, or <strong>Safari</strong>.</li>
          <li>In your web browser, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com">http://pro.arcgis.com</a>. This site from Esri allows you to access various ArcGIS Pro resources. When it opens, you should see the following:</li>

        <p>You now have the knowledge in terms of minimum system and hardware requirements for ArcGIS Pro. We will now move on to the next section regarding the downloading and installation of ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <h1 id="uuid-8f839f7d-66a1-47ff-b4ec-96f68844312e">Downloading and installing ArcGIS Pro</h1>
        <p>Now that you know your computer can run ArcGIS Pro, it is time to install it. First, you will need to download the install files from Esri. Then, you will need to run the install on your computer so that you can run the application.</p>
        <p>In order to complete both these steps, you will need to ensure that a couple of conditions are met. First, you must have the rights to download software from the <span class="packt_screen">My Esri</span> web portal. Second, you must have install or administrative privileges on your computer. These aspects will be covered in the following sections.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-328d1943-e078-4dd7-a9e5-76da7999085d">How to download the installation files</h2>
        <p>In order to install ArcGIS Pro, follow these steps:</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 60px">It can take up to 24 hours or more for Esri to update your permissions, so you will not have access immediately.</p>
        <div class="packt_tip">If you do not have download permissions and cannot wait, you can request a free trial license of ArcGIS through the Esri website. You can do this by going to <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial">https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial</a> and completing the sign-up form.

        <ol start="5">
          <li>Once you are able to access the <span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span> page, you will need to locate ArcGIS Pro and click on <span class="packt_screen">View Downloads</span>. This will take you to the page that allows you to download several files, which you will use to install ArcGIS Pro and supporting applications. You can also check <span class="packt_screen">System Requirements</span>, see additional <span class="packt_screen">Products</span>, and select <span class="packt_screen">Language Packs</span>:</li>

        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">If you do not see the buttons to download the various install files, you will need to expand the <span class="packt_screen">Product Components</span>. The ArcGIS Pro download is the primary install file for the main ArcGIS Pro application. You must download this file if you wish to install ArcGIS Pro. The other files are optional, but recommended.</p>
        <p>The <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro Offline Help</span> option will install help files on your local machine, so you can access them without having an internet connection. By default, ArcGIS Pro accesses help information located on the ArcGIS Pro website, <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com">http://pro.arcgis.com</a>. This means that you will always see the most current help documentation for the version you are using.</p>
        <p>You will need to download and install this file if you will be using ArcGIS Pro in a disconnected environment and think you might need to access <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> documentation. Now that you have downloaded the install files, you are ready to begin installing ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-fa20f22a-b9ca-4c96-8d9e-5e45bb8899dc">Installing ArcGIS Pro</h2>
        <p>First, you will need to make sure that you have sufficient rights to install new software on your computer. This typically requires you to have administrative privileges on your computer. If you do not have the required permissions, you will need to contact your IT department to see whether they can provide assistance in installing ArcGIS Pro. Then, you or the IT staff will need to perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To install ArcGIS Pro, click on the ArcGIS Pro installation file you downloaded. This will unzip the install files.</li>
          <li>You will be asked where you want to unzip or extract the installation files. The default location is <kbd>C:\Users\your username\Documents\ArcGIS Pro 2.6</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot. You can accept the default location by clicking <span class="packt_screen">Next &gt;</span>:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/4669c23e-8dba-42a4-966b-5c4de15ee6bc.png" style="width:28.67em;"/>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">If you wish to unzip to another location, such as a network drive, click the <span class="packt_screen">Browse</span> button and navigate to the desired location. Also, newer versions will unzip to a default folder that is based on the version you have downloaded.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Once unzipped, you will be asked to close the extraction process. There is a checkbox located at the bottom of the window. If it is checked, it will automatically launch the installation process as shown:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/728c2c43-e1d5-46a9-b671-d43d84d6fa23.png" style="width:34.42em;"/>
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Once the install begins, you will first see the welcome screen. This recommends that you close all other applications to ensure they do not conflict with the installation. Because ArcGIS Pro does rely on other applications such as Internet Explorer, it is strongly encouraged that you follow the advice shown here and close any other applications you might have open or running. Once you have closed all other applications, click the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button.</li>
          <li>Next, you will be asked to review and accept the license agreement from Esri. If you wish to install the software, you must accept the license agreement. So, click the circle next to <span class="packt_screen">I accept the master agreement</span> and click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to accept. This will continue the installation process.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="6">
          <li>Now, you will have to choose who will have access to the application, all users or just the current user. If you want to install such that all users can use ArcGIS Pro, you will need to select <span class="packt_screen">Anyone who uses this computer (all users)</span>. If you only want yourself to be able to run ArcGIS Pro, then select <span class="packt_screen">Only for me</span> (your username). Select the appropriate option and then click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>. </li>
          <li>Then, you will choose the install location. By default, ArcGIS Pro will be installed in <kbd>C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\</kbd>. To accept the default install location, just click the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button. If you want to change the install location, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Change</span> button and browse to your desired install location on your local computer.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_tip">It is generally recommended that you use the default location to avoid issues that could cause problems when running ArcGIS Pro after installation. This will also make it easier if you need support for software issues because the support person will be able to quickly find the installed files. </div>
        <ol start="8">
          <li>Finally, you will be asked whether you wish to take part in the <strong>Esri User Experience Improvement</strong> (<strong>EUEI</strong>) program. This will send Esri information about system crashes and other user information automatically if you choose to participate. Either leave the box checked to participate or click on the box to not participate and click <span class="packt_screen">Install</span> to start copying the application files to your computer. </li>
          <li>Once you have run the ArcGIS Pro installation and it is complete, you will see the install window saying it was successful. At the bottom of the window, you will see an option to start ArcGIS Pro once the installation is finished. This option is enabled by default. If your user account has been assigned an ArcGIS Pro license and you wish to start the application, click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>. If you do not wish to run ArcGIS Pro at this time, click on the checkbox to disable the option and click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have now successfully installed ArcGIS Pro. If you have a license assigned to you, you can now open and use the application. We will show you how to assign licenses later in this chapter. </p>
        <h2 id="uuid-a3b8acff-f22a-4dd3-ba61-361e5cd8ae85">Installing ArcGIS Pro offline help files</h2>
        <p>By default, ArcGIS Pro uses online help documentation. This ensures that users have access to the most current help and how-to information for the multitude of functions and tools found in ArcGIS Pro. However, there may be times when you find yourself working in a situation where you do not have access to the web.</p>
        <p>You might be working in the field where no cellular connection is available or maybe working during an emergency where communications are down. In these types of situations, you will not be able to access the online help. You will need to have the help files installed locally on your computer. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your web browser and go to <a href="https://my.esri.com">https://my.esri.com</a>.</li>
          <li>Log in to the <span class="packt_screen">My Esri</span> web portal using your Esri Global Account.</li>
          <li>Follow the same steps you took to download the ArcGIS Pro application install files. The only difference is that you select the ArcGIS Pro Offline Help file as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/d29d9bcf-e334-46d7-8b7d-8b086a98288b.png" style="width:40.50em;"/>
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>As you did with the application install file that was downloaded, click on the <kbd>ArcGIS ProHelp_26_build number.exe</kbd> file to extract the files.</li>
          <li>Select the destination folder. The default is <kbd>C:\Users\your username\Documents\ArcGIS Pro 2.6</kbd>. If you wish to change the location from the default, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Browse</span> button. If you wish to use the default or after you have selected the destination folder, click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>.</li>
          <li>Once the install files for the local help have been extracted, click the <span class="packt_screen">Close</span> button. By default, the setup program will launch.</li>
          <li>Like the application install, you will first see the welcome screen. Click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to proceed with the install of the local help files.</li>
          <li>You should then see the <span class="packt_screen">Ready to Install the Program</span> window. You may click <span class="packt_screen">Back</span> if you wish to change any previous settings or <span class="packt_screen">Cancel</span> to stop the install. If you want to continue with the installation of the local help files, click <span class="packt_screen">Install</span>.</li>
          <li> Once the setup program has finished copying the files to your computer, you will see that the installation has been successfully completed. Click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span> to complete the installation. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have now successfully installed the local help files to your computer or device. However, there is still one more step you will need to complete before ArcGIS Pro actually makes use of the local help files. You will need to configure the ArcGIS Pro option. We will cover how to do that in the next chapter.</p>
        <h1 id="uuid-f09c29e4-2ce0-4c02-b486-3443f234ebd7">Managing and assigning ArcGIS Pro licenses</h1>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">Unlike ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Pro is not just limited to traditional Single Use licenses or Concurrent Use licenses. ArcGIS Pro supports those in addition to Named User licensing. This allows you to pick the licensing method that best meets the needs of your organization. <em>So what are the differences between these types of licensing methods?</em></p>
        <p>In this section, you will learn about ArcGIS Pro licenses, and how to download and assign them. We will also begin with opening our first ArcGIS Pro project.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">Single Use licenses are the traditional software licenses, where you are allowed to install and run the application on a single computer. This was the most common form of license or use authorization for software until recently.</p>
        <p>Concurrent Use licensing is often referred to as a network license. This type of license requires a license server to be set up and configured. It acts as a librarian for your software licenses. When a user starts the application, it first checks with the license server or manager to see whether one is available. If there is an available license, one is checked out to the user, and the application starts. If all licenses are in use, the user gets an error indicating all licenses are in use and the application will not start.</p>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What types of licensing methods may be used with ArcGIS Pro?</em></div>
        <p>Concurrent licenses allow you to install the software on as many computers as you wish, but only the number of users equal to the number of licenses your organization has are able to be running the application at any given time. Esri is slowly eliminating this licensing method in favor of Single Use and Named User methods. If you or your organization is using Concurrent Use licensing, it is recommended you start looking into migrating to one of the other two as you implement ArcGIS Pro.</p>
        <p>ArcGIS Pro uses the <strong>Named User licensing method</strong> by default. This is similar to the licensing used by <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong>. You manage these licenses through ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. This method assigns an ArcGIS Pro license to individual user logins that are part of your ArcGIS Online organizational account or Portal for ArcGIS. Because this is the default licensing method for ArcGIS Pro, we will show you how to assign licenses to your users in ArcGIS Online. The same basic method will also work if you are using Portal for ArcGIS.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-40863fb3-2fd0-4810-960a-a44c196e6cf2">Understanding the number and level of ArcGIS Pro licenses</h2>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">If your organization has been using ArcGIS Desktop and has been paying the annual software maintenance fees, you will get an equal number of levels of ArcGIS Pro licenses. So, if you have 2 licenses for ArcGIS Desktop <strong>Advanced</strong>, 4 licenses for ArcGIS Desktop <strong>Standard</strong>, and 10 Licenses for ArcGIS Desktop <strong>Basic</strong>, you will have the same number and level of ArcGIS Pro licenses, which you can assign to users.</p>
        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What is the default licensing method used by ArcGIS Pro?</em></div>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">For completely new users, the number of licenses and levels will be dependent on what you purchase from Esri or one of their authorized business partners. Esri does offer discounts for multiple licenses as well as for non-profit and educational institutions.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">ArcGIS Pro has three license levels, namely, Basic, Standard, and Advanced. The license level you have or purchase will determine the functionality of the software. Basic will have the least functionality, while advanced will have the most. The following are a few of the functionality differences between the three license levels:</p>

        <div class="packt_infobox">Question: <em>What are the three licensing levels for ArcGIS Pro?</em></div>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">ArcGIS Pro also has extensions that provide increased functionality to the core application. The extensions are separate purchases and licenses, but do require a matching ArcGIS Pro license to run on. If you are migrating from the older ArcGIS Desktop platform, then the licenses for these extensions are also matched with the extensions for ArcGIS Desktop. So, if you have 1 license of Spatial Analyst extension, you will also have one Spatial Analyst for ArcGIS Pro extension license, assuming the annual maintenance for the extension is current.</p>
        <h2 id="uuid-9030fdd1-307c-45f6-8622-6d4c9e0570a6">Assigning ArcGIS Pro licenses</h2>
        <p>As we mentioned earlier, ArcGIS Pro supports multiple licensing models. The default model is Named User licenses, which are managed through ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. To assign or manage licenses for ArcGIS Pro, you must be designated as an administrator. If you are, you can assign ArcGIS Pro and extension licenses to named users.</p>
        <p>To manage or assign licenses, you must perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log in to ArcGIS Online (<a href="https://www.arcgis.com">www.argis.com</a>) or Portal for ArcGIS.</li>
          <li>Once logged in, you will need to click on <span class="packt_screen">Licenses</span>, as shown in the following screenshot. This will require you to be an administrator for your organization:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/1633c984-1216-4ccb-bffd-5a7b5305ca97.png" style="width:69.25em;"/>
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>From the <span class="packt_screen">Licenses</span> page, you can then assign ArcGIS Pro and extension licenses to named users within your organization's ArcGIS Online account or Portal for ArcGIS by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Manage</span> link located under the license level you wish to assign to the user:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
          <img src="assets/711b4315-4680-4f4d-91ef-1a0373e6d546.png" style="width:70.50em;"/>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">You will only see the license levels available to your organization. As shown in the preceding screenshot, my organization only has access to Basic and Advanced licenses. Your organization may only have a single level, or it might have two or even all three.</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Once you are on the <span class="packt_screen">Manage</span> page, simply click the toggle switch located to the right of the user you wish to assign the license to, illustrated as follows:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        </p>
        <p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, <span class="packt_screen">Eric Pimpler</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Polly Corbin</span> have both been assigned ArcGIS Pro Basic licenses, while <span class="packt_screen">Jason Kandrick</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Joshua</span><span class="packt_screen">Knight</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Nathaniel</span><span class="packt_screen">Keith</span> have not. As an administrator, you can change the ArcGIS Pro licenses and extensions assigned to users as needed. You can assign licenses as new users are added or revoke licenses as older users are deactivated or removed.</p>
        <div class="packt_tip">To assign a license to a user, they must be a Creator or Professional user type. ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS have at least five different user types, including viewer, editor, field worker, creator, and professional. If you want to know more about these user types and how to assign licenses, you might be interested in this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/Lny22sjzg9o">https://youtu.be/Lny22sjzg9o</a></div>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">If ArcGIS Desktop is installed on the user's computer, the ArcGIS Pro license level does not have to match the ArcGIS for Desktop license level the user may be running. These are independent of one another.</p>

        <p>Before you can proceed further in the book and complete the exercises, you will need to download and install the exercise data. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the exercise data from Packt Publishing by going to<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">https://www.packtpub.com/</a> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Support</span> from the ribbon menu at the top of the page.</li>
          <li>Then, click on <span class="packt_screen">Code Downloads</span> and, in the search title box, type <kbd>Learning ArcGIS Pro 2 - Second Edition</kbd>. Click on the book title, which should appear under the search box. </li>
          <li>If needed, click on the register link to create your user account. Then, follow the links to download exercise data. </li>
          <li>Once the exercise data has downloaded, open Windows File Explorer, which is typically accessible by clicking on an icon located on your taskbar that looks like a small file folder in a holder.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the location you downloaded the exercise data to. If you downloaded the data to the standard Windows default location, you should be able to click on the <span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span> option under <span class="packt_screen">Favorites</span> in the tree located in the left-hand side of the File Explorer interface.</li>
          <li>Double-click on the<kbd>LearningArcGISPro.zip</kbd>file.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="7">
          <li>Right-click on the <kbd>IntroArcGISPro</kbd> folder located inside the zip folder you downloaded. Then, select <span class="packt_screen">Copy</span>.</li>
          <li>In File Explorer, navigate to your <kbd>C:\</kbd> drive (often named, Local Disk or OS). The <kbd>C:\</kbd> drive may be found under <span class="packt_screen">This PC</span> in the tree on the left-hand side of the File Explorer interface, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

          <li>Close File Explorer once the copy is complete.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have now copied the exercise data that will be required to complete the book to your local computer. </p>
        <h2 id="uuid-bdaba5fd-60b3-400c-bdee-a731ae4c5e27">Launching ArcGIS Pro</h2>
        <p>Now that you have installed ArcGIS Pro and have a license, it is time to launch ArcGIS Pro for the first time. You need to ensure that you are connected to the internet because when you launch ArcGIS Pro, it will need to connect to ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS to make sure that you have a valid license.</p>
        <p>Let's now open ArcGIS Pro:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open ArcGIS Pro. How you do this will depend on your OS and whether you have added shortcuts to your desktop or taskbar. In most cases, the first time you launch ArcGIS Pro, you will need to go to the <span class="packt_screen">Start</span> button located on the lower-left corner of your monitor. It looks like the Windows icon.</li>
          <li>Once you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Start</span> button, scroll through the list of installed programs until you see the ArcGIS folder or group and click on it. This will expand the list of installed ArcGIS programs installed on your computer.</li>
          <li>Select <span class="packt_screen">ArcGIS Pro</span> from the list of programs to start the application. </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="packt_tip">If you want to add a shortcut for ArcGIS Pro to your taskbar, simply right-click on the application name in the <span class="packt_screen">Start</span> menu. Then, select <span class="packt_screen">More</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Pin to Taskbar</span>. Once you have done that, all you need to do is click on the ArcGIS Pro icon in your taskbar to start the application. </div>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Once you start ArcGIS Pro, you will need to sign in to your ArcGIS Online or Portal account. This allows ArcGIS Pro to verify your license. You do have the option to allow ArcGIS Pro to remember your login credentials for ArcGIS Online, so you will not have to log in every time you launch ArcGIS Pro:</li>

        </p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">After ArcGIS Pro verifies your login and license, it will take you to the window that allows you to start a new project or open an existing project. You will now open an existing project, but before you do that, you will need to make sure you have downloaded and installed the exercise data. </p>

        <p>ArcGIS Pro makes use of projects that can contain maps, data connections, toolboxes, and more. You will now open an existing project and begin your first journey into ArcGIS Pro to help verify the successful installation of ArcGIS Pro and your exercise data. You will get an opportunity to explore 2D and 3D maps, a layout, and other project items as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro from the previous section, open ArcGIS Pro and log in if required.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>In the ArcGIS Pro start page, click on <span class="packt_screen">Open another project</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">Take a moment to review the <span class="packt_screen">Start</span> page. It is divided into three columns. The first is for opening existing projects like the one you are about to open. At the top of the first column is a list of recently opened projects. If this is your first time opening a project with ArcGIS Pro, this area will be blank, as shown in the previous screenshot.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px">If this is not the first time, you will see a list of one or more projects that you have opened. As you move through the book, you will see projects added to this section. The second column area is to create new projects. It contains a list of project templates included with ArcGIS Pro. You will learn how to create your own projects later in this book. The last column area is a list of project templates you have used recently to generate new projects as well as the option at the bottom to select a different template. </p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>The last step should have opened the <span class="packt_screen">Open Project</span> window. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Computer</span> in the left panel of the window. This should be below <span class="packt_screen">Portal</span>.</li>

        <p>You have learned about ArcGIS Pro licenses and their levels, and you have also opened your first ArcGIS Pro project and begun navigating in a map. Congratulations on your first step toward leveraging the power of ArcGIS Pro to visualize and query information!</p>
        <h1 id="uuid-48dd6b2f-afb3-4709-b2a4-a39e166a5700">Summary</h1>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">You have now successfully installed and started to use ArcGIS Pro. So you now have the skills to install and get working with ArcGIS Pro. This new 64-bit hyperthreaded application from Esri provides an effective tool to visualize a range of data, including 2D and 3D. This increased capability does require a greater amount of system resources to run effectively compared with the earlier ArcGIS applications.</p>
        <p class="NormalPACKT">In this chapter, you discovered that ArcGIS Pro makes use of a new licensing model, Named Users, in addition to a traditional Single Use or concurrent license. You also learned that ArcGIS Pro Named User licenses are managed through your organization's ArcGIS Online account or Portal for ArcGIS. It was also pointed out that only users in your organization that are creators or professional user types may be assigned an ArcGIS Pro license.</p>
        <p>From there, you opened your first ArcGIS Pro project. This provided you with the skills to deal with projects that may contain multiple items, including 2D and 3D maps, but that is just the beginning, as you will learn in later chapters. Once you opened the project, you used the Explore tool to navigate within a map and retrieve information about the features you see. </p>
        <p>In the next chapter, you will take a closer look at the ArcGIS Pro user interface. You will examine commonly used tools and where to find them.</p>
