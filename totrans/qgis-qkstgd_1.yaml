- en: QGIS is free and open source software. It is a **G****eographical Information
    System** (**GIS**). QGIS enables users to create, manipulate, and visualize spatial
    data. Spatial data is data associated to a location or a place, commonly defined
    in terms of vector (points, lines, or polygons) or raster (bitmap) data. The QGIS
    project began in 2002 as a way of importing and viewing data from **PostGIS**
    (also open source software that adds geographic support to PostgreSQL) enabled
    database. QGIS is arguably now the leading open source GIS software package.

    the QGIS project, you can inspect the changes in the visual changelog available
    at this website: [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelogs.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelogs.htm).
    The processing framework was rewritten and has improved the performance significantly.
    Now, QGIS 3 provides users access to Python 3\. This means many of the plugins,
    that make QGIS so powerful, have been updated to be compatible with the new API.
    At the time of writing, QGIS 3 had been out for almost a year. QGIS 3.4 was released
    in October, 2018\. It is scheduled to become the first **Long Term Release** (**LTR**)
    of the QGIS 3 series in early 2019.'

- en: This book is a quick start guide to QGIS; it uses the LTR 3.4 release as its
    foundation. It is recommended that you use this version while working through
    this book. The book has been written in such a way that you should be able to
    apply the foundational knowledge gained to future releases. However, QGIS is actively
    developed software and subject to change.

    it via the **OSGeo4W** installer. OSGeo4W is a small program that allows you not
    only to download and install QGIS, but also other OSGeo tools. We recommend that
    you use this installer for QGIS. You can download the 32-bit or the 64-bit OSGeo4W
    installers from [http://osgeo4w.osgeo.org](http://osgeo4w.osgeo.org), or, you
    can download directly from [http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe)
    or [http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe).
    Download the version that matches your operating system and keep it. In the future,
    whenever you want to change or update your system, just run it again.

    the Browser panel, you can drag data into the map. The Layers panel shows the
    data and its drawing order. Right-clicking on a layer in the Layers panel opens
    a context menu that lets you interact with that layer. We will be working with
    the Layers panel throughout this book. At the bottom of the QGIS project, we can
    see Status Bar. Status Bar is useful for quickly finding out what projection you
    are working in or the scale of the map. Finally, at the top of QGIS there is the
