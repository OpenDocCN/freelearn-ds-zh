<p>You can either use iSAX as a traditional index or something more sophisticated, as we did in <a href="B14769_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>. With this practical application of iSAX, we have reached the last chapter of this book! Thank you for reading this book, which is a collaborative effort of lots of people and not just <span class="No-Break">the author.</span></p>
<p>Time series and time series data mining, in general, are hot topics both in academia and industry, mainly because nowadays, data usually comes in a time series manner. As if this were not enough, those time series contain a lot of data that we need to process quickly <span class="No-Break">and accurately.</span></p>
<p>This chapter will give you directions on where and what to look at next if you are really into time series <span class="No-Break">or databases.</span></p>
<p><strong class="bold">Disclaimer</strong>: All mentioned books and research papers are personal preferences. Your own taste or research interests <span class="No-Break">might vary.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Concluding all that we have learned <span class="No-Break">so far</span></li>
<li>Other variations <span class="No-Break">of iSAX</span></li>
<li>Interesting research papers on <span class="No-Break">time series</span></li>
<li>Interesting research papers <span class="No-Break">on databases</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Useful books</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Concluding all that we have learned so far</h1>
<p>Time series are everywhere! But time series tend to get larger and larger as we collect more data, more <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>frequently. Therefore, we need ways to process and search large time series faster and faster in order to make useful deductions from <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
<p>The iSAX index is here to help you search your time series data fast. I hope that this book has given <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>you the necessary tools and knowledge to begin working with time series and subsequences, as well as the iSAX index in Python. However, the knowledge and the presented techniques are easily transferable to other programming languages, including but not limited to <em class="italic">Swift</em>, Java, C, <em class="italic">C++</em>, Ruby, Kotlin, <em class="italic">Go</em>, <em class="italic">Rust</em>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">JavaScript</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>We believe that we have provided the right amount of knowledge about time series indexing using the right amount of theory and practice so you can successfully work with time series and develop <span class="No-Break">iSAX indexes.</span></p>
<p>The next section presents improved versions <span class="No-Break">of iSAX.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Other variations of iSAX</h1>
<p>This book has taught you the initial form of iSAX. There exist more variations of iSAX that make its <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>operation and its construction much faster. However, the core functionality remains the same. You can look into them by reading the following <span class="No-Break">research papers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">iSAX 2.0: Indexing and Mining One Billion Time Series</em>, written by Alessandro Camerra, Themis Palpanas, Jin Shieh, and <span class="No-Break">Eamonn Keogh</span></li>
<li><em class="italic">Beyond one billion time series: Indexing and mining very large time series collections with iSAX2+</em>, written by Alessandro Camerra, Jin Shieh, Themis Palpanas, Thanawin Rakthanmanon, and <span class="No-Break">Eamonn Keogh</span></li>
<li><em class="italic">DPiSAX: Massively Distributed Partitioned iSAX</em>, written by Djamel Edine Yagoubi, Reza Akbarinia, Florent Masseglia, and <span class="No-Break">Themis Palpanas</span></li>
<li><em class="italic">Evolution of a Data Series Index: The iSAX Family of Data Series Indexes: iSAX, iSAX2.0, iSAX2+, ADS, ADS+, ADS-Full, ParIS, ParIS+, MESSI, DPiSAX, ULISSE, Coconut-Trie/Tree, Coconut-LSM</em>, written by <span class="No-Break">Themis Palpanas</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that all these are advanced research papers that you might find difficult to understand at first. However, if you are persistent, you will eventually <span class="No-Break">understand them.</span></p>
<p>In the database area, there exist many indexes because indexing is essential for answering SQL queries fast. Even if they are not directly connected to time series, you might want to have a look at them and adjust them in order to work with time series <span class="No-Break">and subsequences.</span></p>
<p>A very famous index is called <strong class="bold">R-tree</strong>, which is a hierarchical data structure based on the <strong class="bold">B+- tree</strong>. You can learn <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>more about the R-tree index <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>by reading <em class="italic">R-trees: A Dynamic Index Structure for Spatial Searching</em>, written by <span class="No-Break">Antonin Guttman.</span></p>
<p>Last, a new time series index appeared while writing this book that is also based on the SAX representation and tries to <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>correct the disadvantages of iSAX. The name of the new index is <strong class="bold">Dumpy</strong>. The core logic behind Dumpy is the same as in iSAX, but it makes adjustments during the building of the index in order to have a better subsequence distribution inside <span class="No-Break">the index.</span></p>
<p>You can find more <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>information about Dumpy by reading the paper <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08264"><span class="No-Break">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08264</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
