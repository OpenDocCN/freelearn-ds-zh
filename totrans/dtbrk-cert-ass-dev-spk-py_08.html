			<p>Machine learning has gained popularity in recent times. In this chapter, we will do a comprehensive exploration of <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>Spark <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>), a powerful framework for scalable ML on Apache Spark. We will delve into the foundational concepts of ML and how Spark ML leverages these principles to enable efficient and scalable <span class="No-Break">data-driven insights.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Key concepts <span class="No-Break">in ML</span></li>
				<li>Different types <span class="No-Break">of ML</span></li>
				<li>ML <span class="No-Break">with Spark</span></li>

				<li>Different case studies <span class="No-Break">for ML</span></li>
				<li>Future trends in Spark ML and <span class="No-Break">distributed ML</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>ML encompasses diverse methodologies tailored to different data scenarios. We will start by learning about different key concepts <span class="No-Break">in ML.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Introduction to ML</h1>
			<p>ML is a field of study <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computer systems to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is a subset of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) that<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> aims to provide systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from data <span class="No-Break">and experience.</span></p>
			<p>In today’s world, where vast amounts of data are being generated at an unprecedented rate, ML plays a critical role in extracting meaningful insights, making accurate predictions, and automating decision-making processes. As data grows, machines can learn the patterns better, thus making it even easier to gain insights from this data. It finds applications in various domains, including finance, healthcare, marketing, image and speech recognition, recommendation<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> systems, and <span class="No-Break">many more.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>The key concepts of ML</h2>
			<p>To understand ML, it is<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> important to grasp the fundamental concepts that underpin <span class="No-Break">its methodology.</span></p>
			<h3>Data</h3>
			<p>Data is the foundation <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>of any ML process. It can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured and encompasses various types, such as numerical, categorical, text, images, and more. ML algorithms require high-quality, relevant, and representative data to learn patterns and make accurate predictions. When dealing with ML problems, it is imperative to have data that can answer the question that we’re trying to solve. The quality of data used in any analysis or model-building process significantly impacts the outcomes and decisions derived from it. Bad or poor-quality data can lead to inaccurate, unreliable, or misleading results, ultimately affecting the overall performance and credibility of any analysis <span class="No-Break">or model.</span></p>
			<p>An ML model trained on bad data is likely to make inaccurate predictions or classifications. For instance, a model trained on incomplete or biased data might incorrectly identify loyal customers as potential churners or <span class="No-Break">vice versa.</span></p>
			<p>Decision-makers relying on flawed or biased analysis derived from bad data might implement strategies based on inaccurate insights. For instance, marketing campaigns targeting the wrong customer segments due to flawed churn predictions can lead to wasted resources and <span class="No-Break">missed opportunities.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, we need to make sure that the data we’re using for ML problems is representative of the population that we want to build the models for. The other thing to note is that data might have some inherent biases in it. It is our responsibility to look for them and be aware of them when using this data to build <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<h3>Features</h3>
			<p>Features are the<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> measurable properties or characteristics of the data that the ML algorithm uses to make predictions or decisions. They are the variables or attributes that capture the relevant information from the data. Out of the vast amounts of data that are present, we want to understand which features of this data would be useful for solving a particular problem. Relevant features would generate <span class="No-Break">better models.</span></p>
			<p>Feature engineering, the process of selecting, extracting, and transforming features, plays a crucial role in improving the performance of <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<h3>Labels and targets</h3>
			<p>Labels or targets<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> are the desired outputs or outcomes that the ML model aims to predict or classify. In supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data, the labels represent the correct answers or class labels associated with the input data. In unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or clusters in the data without any <span class="No-Break">explicit labels.</span></p>
			<h3>Training and testing</h3>
			<p>In ML, models are<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> trained using a subset of the available data, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> called the <strong class="bold">training set</strong>. The training process involves feeding the input data and corresponding labels to the model, which learns from this data to make predictions. Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using a separate subset of data called the testing set. This evaluation helps assess the model’s ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on <span class="No-Break">unseen data.</span></p>
			<h3>Algorithms and models</h3>
			<p>ML algorithms <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>are mathematical or statistical procedures that learn patterns and relationships in the data and make predictions or decisions. They can be categorized into various types, including regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning. These algorithms, when trained on data, generate models that capture the learned patterns and can be used to make predictions on new, <span class="No-Break">unseen data.</span></p>
			<p>Discussing different ML algorithms in depth is beyond the scope of this book. We will talk about different <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>types of ML problems in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Types of ML</h2>
			<p>ML problems can be<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> broadly categorized into two distinct categories. In this section, we will explore both <span class="No-Break">of them.</span></p>
			<h3>Supervised learning</h3>
			<p>Supervised <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>learning is a type of ML where the<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. In supervised learning, the training data consists of input features and corresponding output labels or target values. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict the output for new, <span class="No-Break">unseen inputs.</span></p>
			<p>The process of supervised learning involves the <span class="No-Break">following steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data preparation</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>first step is to collect and preprocess the training data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for the learning algorithm. The data should be split into features (input variables) and labels (<span class="No-Break">output variables).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model training</strong>: Once the data has been prepared, the supervised learning algorithm is trained on the labeled training data. The algorithm learns the patterns and relationships between the input features and the corresponding output labels. The goal is to find a model that can generalize well to unseen data and make <span class="No-Break">accurate predictions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model evaluation</strong>: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. This is done using a separate set of data called the testing or validation set. The model’s predictions are compared with the actual labels in the testing set, and various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error <span class="No-Break">are calculated.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model deployment and prediction</strong>: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data. The trained model takes the input features of the new data and produces predictions or decisions based on what it has learned during the <span class="No-Break">training phase.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, <strong class="bold">support vector machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">SVM</strong>), decision <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Again, going in-depth on these algorithms is beyond the scope of this book. You<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> can read more about them <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/><span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html"><span class="No-Break">https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
			<p>Unsupervised<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> learning is a type of ML where<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> the algorithm learns patterns and relationships in the data without any labeled output. In unsupervised learning, the training data consists only of input features, and the goal is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters within <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p>The process of unsupervised learning involves the <span class="No-Break">following steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data preparation</strong>: Similar to<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> supervised learning, the first step is to collect and preprocess the data. However, in unsupervised learning, there are no labeled output values or target variables. The data is transformed and prepared in a way that it’s suitable for the specific unsupervised <span class="No-Break">learning algorithm.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model training</strong>: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on the input features without any specific target variable. The algorithm explores the data and identifies patterns or clusters based on statistical properties or similarity measures. The goal is to extract meaningful information from the data without any <span class="No-Break">predefined labels.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model evaluation</strong> (optional): Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have a direct evaluation metric based on known labels. Evaluation in unsupervised learning is often subjective and depends on the specific task or problem domain. It is also a more manual process than it is in supervised learning. Evaluation can involve visualizing the discovered clusters, assessing the quality of dimensionality reduction, or using domain knowledge to validate <span class="No-Break">the results.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pattern discovery and insights</strong>: The primary objective of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms can reveal insights about the data, identify anomalies or outliers, perform<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> dimensionality reduction, or <span class="No-Break">generate recommendations.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, <strong class="bold">principal component analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCA</strong>), association <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>rule<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> mining, and <strong class="bold">self-organizing </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">maps</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SOM</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>In conclusion, supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two key types of ML. Supervised learning relies on labeled data to learn patterns and make predictions, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Both types have their own set of algorithms and techniques, as well as different choices. Discussing unsupervised learning in depth is beyond the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we will explore supervised ML, a cornerstone in the realm of AI and data science that <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>represents a powerful<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> approach to building predictive models and making <span class="No-Break">data-driven decisions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Types of supervised learning</h2>
			<p>As we know, supervised<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> learning is a branch of ML where algorithms learn patterns and relationships from labeled training data. It involves teaching or supervising the model by presenting input data along with corresponding output labels, allowing the algorithm to learn the mapping between the input and output variables. We’ll explore three key types of supervised learning – classification, regression, and <span class="No-Break">time series.</span></p>
			<h3>Classification</h3>
			<p>Classification is a <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>type of ML task where the goal is to<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> categorize or classify data into predefined classes or categories based on its features. The algorithm learns from labeled training data to build a model that can predict the class label of new, unseen <span class="No-Break">data instances.</span></p>
			<p>In classification, the output is discrete and represents class labels. Some common algorithms that are used for classification tasks include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM, and <span class="No-Break">naive Bayes.</span></p>
			<p>For example, consider a spam email classification task, where the goal is to predict whether an incoming email is spam or not. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is associated with a class label indicating whether it is spam or not. The trained model can then classify new emails as spam or non-spam based on their features, such as the content, subject, <span class="No-Break">or sender.</span></p>
			<h3>Regression</h3>
			<p>Regression is <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>another type of ML task that focuses on predicting <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>continuous or numerical values based on input features. In regression, the algorithm learns from labeled training data to build a model that can estimate or forecast the numerical value of a target variable given a set of <span class="No-Break">input features.</span></p>
			<p>Regression models are used when the output is a continuous value, such as predicting house prices, stock market trends, or predicting the sales of a product based on historical data. Some commonly used regression algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and <span class="No-Break">neural networks.</span></p>
			<p>For example, consider a case where you want to predict the price of a house based on its various features, such as the area, number of bedrooms, location, and so on. In this case, the algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled house data, where each house is associated with its corresponding price. The trained regression model can then predict the price of a new house based on <span class="No-Break">its features.</span></p>
			<h3>Time series</h3>
			<p>Time series analysis <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>is a specialized area of ML that deals <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>with data collected over time, where the order of observations is important. In time series analysis, the goal is to understand and forecast the patterns, trends, and dependencies within <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p>Time series models are used to predict future values based on historical data points. They are widely used in fields such as finance, stock market prediction, weather forecasting, and<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> demand forecasting. Some popular time series algorithms include <strong class="bold">Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average</strong> (<strong class="bold">ARIMA</strong>), exponential smoothing <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>methods, and <strong class="bold">long short-term memory</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">LSTM</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) networks.</span></p>
			<p>For example, suppose you have historical stock market data for a particular company, including the date and the corresponding stock prices. The time series algorithm can analyze the patterns and trends in the data and make predictions about future stock prices based on historical <span class="No-Break">price fluctuations.</span></p>
			<p>In conclusion, supervised learning encompasses various types, including classification, regression, and time series analysis. Each type addresses specific learning tasks and requires different algorithms and techniques. Understanding these types helps in choosing the<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> appropriate algorithms and approaches for specific<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> data analysis and <span class="No-Break">prediction tasks.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will explore how to leverage Spark for <span class="No-Break">ML tasks.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>ML with Spark</h1>
			<p>Spark provides a powerful<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> and scalable platform for<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> performing large-scale ML tasks. Spark’s <strong class="bold">ML library</strong>, also known as <strong class="bold">MLlib</strong>, offers a wide range of algorithms and tools for building <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>and <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>deploying <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<p>The advantages of using Spark for ML include its distributed computing capabilities, efficient data processing, scalability, and integration with other Spark components, such as Spark SQL and Spark Streaming. Spark’s MLlib supports both batch and streaming data processing, enabling the development of real-time <span class="No-Break">ML applications.</span></p>
			<p>ML is a transformative field that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. By understanding the key concepts and leveraging tools such as Spark’s MLlib, we can harness the power of ML to gain insights, automate processes, and drive innovation across <span class="No-Break">various domains.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s take a look at the benefits of using Spark for <span class="No-Break">ML tasks.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Advantages of Apache Spark for large-scale ML</h2>
			<p>By leveraging <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>Spark’s distributed computing capabilities and rich ecosystem, data scientists and engineers can effectively tackle complex ML challenges on massive datasets. It offers various advantages due to its distributed computing capabilities, some of which are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Speed and performance</strong>: One of the key advantages of Apache Spark is its ability to handle large-scale data processing with exceptional speed. Spark leverages in-memory computing and optimized data processing techniques, such as <strong class="bold">data parallelism</strong> and <strong class="bold">task pipelining</strong>, to accelerate computations. This makes<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> it highly<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> efficient for iterative algorithms often used in ML, reducing the overall processing <span class="No-Break">time significantly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributed computing</strong>: Spark’s distributed computing model allows it to distribute data and computations across multiple nodes in a cluster, enabling parallel processing. This distributed nature enables Spark to scale horizontally, leveraging the computing power of multiple machines and processing data in parallel. This makes it well-suited for large-scale ML tasks that require processing massive volumes <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fault tolerance</strong>: Another advantage of Apache Spark is its built-in fault tolerance mechanism. Spark automatically tracks the lineage of <strong class="bold">Resilient Distributed Datasets</strong> (<strong class="bold">RDDs</strong>), which <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>are the fundamental data abstraction in Spark, allowing it to recover from failures and rerun failed tasks. This ensures the reliability and resilience of Spark applications, making it a robust platform for handling large-scale <span class="No-Break">ML workloads.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Versatility and flexibility</strong>: Spark provides a wide range of APIs and libraries that facilitate various data processing and analytics tasks, including ML. Spark’s MLlib library offers a rich set of distributed ML algorithms and utilities, making it easy to develop and deploy scalable ML models. Additionally, Spark integrates well with other popular data processing frameworks and tools, enabling seamless integration into existing data pipelines <span class="No-Break">and ecosystems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Real-time and streaming capabilities</strong>: As we discussed in the previous chapter, Spark extends its capabilities beyond batch processing with its streaming component called Spark Streaming. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where immediate insights or decisions are required based on continuously arriving data, such as real-time fraud detection, sensor data analysis, or sentiment analysis on social <span class="No-Break">media streams.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ecosystem and community support</strong>: Apache Spark has a vibrant and active community of developers and contributors, ensuring continuous development, improvement, and support. Spark benefits from a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions, providing additional functionality and integration options. The community-driven nature of Spark ensures a wealth of resources, documentation, tutorials, and online forums for learning <span class="No-Break">and troubleshooting.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore, Apache Spark offers significant advantages for large-scale ML tasks. Its speed, scalability, fault tolerance, versatility, and real-time capabilities make it a powerful framework for <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>processing big data and developing scalable <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s take a look at different libraries that Spark provides to make use of ML capabilities in the <span class="No-Break">distributed framework.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Spark MLlib versus Spark ML</h2>
			<p>Apache Spark provides two libraries for ML: Spark MLlib and Spark ML. Although they share a similar name, there are some key differences between the two libraries in terms of their design, APIs, and functionality. Let’s compare Spark MLlib and Spark ML to understand their characteristics and <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
			<h3>Spark MLlib</h3>
			<p>Spark MLlib is the<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> original ML library in Apache Spark. It was<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> introduced in earlier versions of Spark and provides a rich set of distributed ML algorithms and utilities. MLlib is built on top of the RDD API, which is the core data abstraction <span class="No-Break">in Spark.</span></p>
			<p>Spark MLlib has a few key features that set it apart from other non-distributed ML libraries such as <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>. Let’s look at a few <span class="No-Break">of them:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">RDD-based API</strong>: MLlib leverages the RDD abstraction for distributed data processing, making it suitable for batch processing and iterative algorithms. The RDD API allows for efficient distributed computing but can be low-level and complex for some <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Diverse algorithms</strong>: MLlib offers a wide range of distributed ML algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and more. These algorithms are implemented to work with large-scale data and can handle various tasks in the <span class="No-Break">ML pipeline.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature engineering</strong>: MLlib provides utilities for feature extraction, transformation, and selection. It includes methods for handling categorical and numerical features, text processing, and <span class="No-Break">feature scaling.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model persistence</strong>: MLlib supports model persistence, allowing trained models to be saved to disk and loaded later for deployment or <span class="No-Break">further analysis.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>will explore the Spark ML library. This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>newer library that also provides <span class="No-Break">ML capabilities.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break">Spark ML</span></p>
			<p>Spark ML, introduced in Spark 2.0, is the newer ML library in Apache Spark. It is designed to be more user-friendly, with a higher-level API and a focus on DataFrames, which are a structured and optimized distributed data collection introduced in <span class="No-Break">Spark SQL.</span></p>
			<p>The key features of Spark ML are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">DataFrame-based API</strong>: Spark ML leverages the DataFrame API, which provides a more intuitive and higher-level interface compared to the RDD API. DataFrames offer a structured and tabular data representation, making it easier to work with structured data and integrate with <span class="No-Break">Spark SQL.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pipelines</strong>: Spark ML introduces the concept of pipelines, which provides a higher-level abstraction for constructing ML workflows. Pipelines enable the chaining of multiple data transformations and model training stages into a single pipeline, simplifying the development and deployment of complex <span class="No-Break">ML pipelines.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrated feature transformers</strong>: Spark ML includes a rich set of feature transformers, such as StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, and more. These transformers seamlessly integrate with DataFrames and simplify the feature <span class="No-Break">engineering process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Unified API</strong>: Spark ML unifies the APIs for different ML tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation. This provides a consistent and cohesive programming interface across different algorithms and simplifies the <span class="No-Break">learning curve.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we know the key features of both Spark MLlib and Spark ML, let’s explore when to use each <span class="No-Break">of them.</span></p>
			<p>You would<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> benefit from <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>using Spark MLlib in the <span class="No-Break">following scenarios:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are working with older versions of Spark that do not support <span class="No-Break">Spark ML</span></li>
				<li>You require low-level control and need to work directly <span class="No-Break">with RDDs</span></li>
				<li>You need access to a specific algorithm or functionality that is not available in <span class="No-Break">Spark ML</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should prefer to use Spark ML in the <span class="No-Break">following scenarios:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are using Spark 2.0 or <span class="No-Break">later versions</span></li>
				<li>You prefer a higher-level API and want to leverage DataFrames and Spark <span class="No-Break">SQL capabilities</span></li>
				<li>You need to build end-to-end ML pipelines with integrated feature transformers <span class="No-Break">and pipelines</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both Spark MLlib and Spark ML provide powerful ML capabilities in Apache Spark. As we’ve seen, Spark MLlib is the original library with a rich set of distributed algorithms, while Spark ML is a newer library with a more user-friendly API and integration with DataFrames. The<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> choice <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>between the two depends on your Spark version, preference for API style, and specific requirements of your <span class="No-Break">ML tasks.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>ML life cycle</h1>
			<p>The ML life cycle <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>encompasses the end-to-end process of developing and deploying ML models. It involves several stages, each with its own set of tasks and considerations. Understanding the ML life cycle is crucial for building robust and successful ML solutions. In this section, we will explore the key stages of the ML <span class="No-Break">life cycle:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Problem definition</strong>: The first<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> stage of the ML life cycle is problem definition. It involves clearly defining the problem you want to solve and understanding the goals and objectives of your ML project. This stage requires collaboration between domain experts and data scientists to identify the problem, define success metrics, and establish the scope of <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data acquisition and understanding</strong>: Once the problem has been defined, the next step is to acquire the necessary data for training and evaluation. Data acquisition may involve collecting data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or external datasets. It is important to ensure data quality, completeness, and relevance to the problem at hand. Additionally, data understanding involves exploring and analyzing the acquired data to gain insights into its structure, distributions, and <span class="No-Break">potential issues.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data preparation and feature engineering</strong>: Data preparation and feature engineering are crucial steps in the ML life cycle. It involves transforming and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for training ML models. This includes tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and creating new features through feature engineering techniques. Proper data preparation and feature engineering significantly impact the performance and accuracy of <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model training and evaluation</strong>: In this stage, ML models are trained on the prepared data. Model training involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, defining the model architecture, and optimizing its parameters using training data. The trained model is then evaluated using evaluation metrics and validation techniques to assess its performance. This stage often requires iterating and fine-tuning the model to achieve the desired accuracy <span class="No-Break">and generalization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model deployment</strong>: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it is ready for deployment. Model deployment involves integrating the model into the production environment, making predictions on new data, and monitoring its performance. This may involve setting up APIs, creating batch or real-time inference systems, and ensuring the model’s scalability and reliability. Deployment also includes considerations for model versioning, monitoring, and retraining to maintain the model’s effectiveness <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model monitoring and maintenance</strong>: Once the model has been deployed, it is important to <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>continuously monitor its performance and maintain its effectiveness. Monitoring involves tracking model predictions, detecting anomalies, and collecting feedback from users or domain experts. It also includes periodic retraining of the model using new data to adapt to changing patterns or concepts. Model maintenance involves addressing model drift, updating dependencies, and managing the model’s life cycle in the <span class="No-Break">production environment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model iteration and improvement</strong>: The ML life cycle is an iterative process, and models often require improvement over time. Based on user feedback, performance metrics, and changing business requirements, models may need to be updated, retrained, or replaced. Iteration and improvement are essential for keeping the models up-to-date and ensuring they continue to deliver <span class="No-Break">accurate predictions.</span></li>

			<p>The ML life cycle involves problem definition, data acquisition, data preparation, model training, model deployment, model monitoring, and model iteration. Each stage plays a critical role in<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> developing successful ML solutions. By following a well-defined life cycle, organizations can effectively build, deploy, and maintain ML models to solve complex problems and derive valuable insights from <span class="No-Break">their data.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Problem statement</h1>
			<p>Let’s dive into a case study <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>where we’ll explore the art of predicting house prices using historical data. Picture this: we have a treasure trove of valuable information about houses, including details such as zoning, lot area, building type, overall condition, year built, and sale price. Our goal is to harness the power of ML to accurately forecast the price of a new house that comes <span class="No-Break">our way.</span></p>
			<p>To accomplish this feat, we’ll embark on a journey to construct an ML model exclusively designed for predicting house prices. This model will leverage the existing historical data and incorporate additional features. By carefully analyzing and understanding the relationships between these features and the corresponding sale prices, our model will become a reliable tool for estimating the value of any new house that enters <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>
			<p>To achieve this, we will go through some of the steps defined in the previous section, where we talked about the ML life cycle. Since housing prices are continuous, we will use a linear regression model to predict <span class="No-Break">these prices.</span></p>
			<p>We will start by preparing the data to make it usable for an <span class="No-Break">ML model.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Data preparation and feature engineering</h2>
			<p>As we know, data <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>preparation and feature <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>engineering are crucial steps in<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> ML process. Proper data preparation and feature engineering techniques can significantly improve the performance and accuracy of models. In this section, we will explore common data preparation and feature engineering tasks with <span class="No-Break">code examples.</span></p>
			<h3>Introduction to the dataset</h3>
			<p>The first step in <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>building <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>a model is to find the relevant data. We are going to use house price data (located at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1caaR9pT24GNmq3rDQpMiIMJrmiTGarbs/edit#gid=1150341366">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1caaR9pT24GNmq3rDQpMiIMJrmiTGarbs/edit#gid=1150341366</a>) for this purpose. This data has 2,920 rows and <span class="No-Break">13 columns.</span></p>
			<p>This dataset has the <span class="No-Break">following columns:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Id</strong>: Unique identifier for each row of <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">MSSubClass</strong>: Subclass of <span class="No-Break">the property</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">MSZoning</strong>: Zoning of <span class="No-Break">the property</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">LotArea</strong>: Total area of the lot where the property <span class="No-Break">is situated</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">LotConfig</strong>: Configuration of the lot – for example, if it’s a <span class="No-Break">corner lot</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">BldgType</strong>: Type of home – for example, single, family, and <span class="No-Break">so on</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">OverallCond</strong>: General condition of <span class="No-Break">the house</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">YearBuilt</strong>: The year the house was <span class="No-Break">built in</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">YearRemodAdd</strong>: The year any remodeling <span class="No-Break">was done</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Exterior1st</strong>: Type of exterior – for example, vinyl, siding, and <span class="No-Break">so on</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">BsmtFinSF2</strong>: Total size of <span class="No-Break">finished basement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">TotalBsmtSF</strong>: Total size <span class="No-Break">of basement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">SalePrice</strong>: The sale price of <span class="No-Break">the house</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will download this <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>data <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>from the link provided at the beginning of <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we know some of the data points that exist in the data, let’s learn how to <span class="No-Break">load it.</span></p>
			<h3>Loading data</h3>
			<p>At this point, we already have the data downloaded on our computer and to our Databricks environment as a CSV file. As you may recall from the previous chapters, we learned how to load a dataset into a DataFrame through various techniques. We will use a CSV file here to load <span class="No-Break">the data:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
housing_data = spark.read.csv("HousePricePrediction.csv")
# Printing first 5 records of the dataset
housing_data.show(5)</pre>			<p>We can see the result in <span class="No-Break">Figure 8</span>.1. Please note that we can see only part of the result in the image since the dataset is too large to be displayed <span class="No-Break">in full.:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19176_08_1.jpg" alt="" role="presentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Let’s print the schema of <span class="No-Break">this dataset:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
housing_data.printSchema</pre>			<p>We will get the <span class="No-Break">following schema:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;bound method DataFrame.printSchema of DataFrame[Id: bigint, MSSubClass: bigint, MSZoning: string, LotArea: bigint, LotConfig: string, BldgType: string, OverallCond: bigint, YearBuilt: bigint, YearRemodAdd: bigint, Exterior1st: string, BsmtFinSF2: bigint, TotalBsmtSF: bigint, SalePrice: bigint]&gt;</pre>			<p>As you may have <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>noticed, some <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>of the column types are strings. We will clean <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>up<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> this data in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h3>Cleaning data</h3>
			<p>Cleaning the data involves handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data. Before we clean up the data, we will see how many rows are in the data. We can do this by using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">count()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> function:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
housing_data.count()</pre>			<p>The result of this statement is <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
2919</pre>			<p>This means the data contains 2,919 rows before we apply any cleaning. Now, we will drop missing values from this dataset, <span class="No-Break">like so:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
# Remove rows with missing values
cleaned_data = housing_data.dropna()
cleaned_data.count()</pre>			<p>The result of this code is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
1460</pre>			<p>This shows that we have dropped some rows of data and that the data size is <span class="No-Break">smaller now.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we will discuss categorical variables and how to handle them, specifically those represented as strings in <span class="No-Break">our example.</span></p>
			<h3>Handling categorical variables</h3>
			<p>In the realm of statistics and data analysis, a categorical variable is a type of variable that represents categories or groups and can take on a limited, fixed number of distinct values or levels. These variables signify qualitative characteristics and do not possess inherent numerical significance or magnitude. Instead, they represent different attributes or labels that classify data into specific groups or classes. Categorical variables need to be encoded to numerical values before training machine <span class="No-Break">learning models.</span></p>
			<p>In our example, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>a<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> few columns that are string types. Those need to <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>be <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>encoded into numerical values so that the model can correctly use them. For this purpose, we’ll use Spark’s <strong class="source-inline">StringIndexer</strong> library to index the <span class="No-Break">string columns.</span></p>
			<p>The following code shows how to <span class="No-Break">use </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">StringIndexer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#import required libraries
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer
mszoning_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="MSZoning", outputCol="MSZoningIndex")
#Fits a model to the input dataset with optional parameters.
df_mszoning = mszoning_indexer.fit(cleaned_data).transform(cleaned_data)
df_mszoning.show()</pre>			<p>In the preceding code, we are taking the <strong class="source-inline">MSZoning</strong> column and converting it into an indexed column. To achieve this, we created a <strong class="source-inline">StringIndexer</strong> value by the name of <strong class="source-inline">mszoning</strong> indexer. We gave it <strong class="source-inline">MSZoning</strong> as the input column to work on. The output column’s name is <strong class="source-inline">MSZoningIndex</strong>. We will use this output column in the next step. After <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>that, we’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>fit <strong class="source-inline">mszoning_indexer</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">cleaned_data</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In the resulting <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>DataFrame, you will notice that one additional column was added by the name <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">MSZoningIndex</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now, we will use a pipeline to transform all the features in <span class="No-Break">the DataFrame.</span></p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">pipeline</strong> brings <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>together a series of essential steps, each contributing to transforming raw data into valuable predictions and analyses. The pipeline serves as a structured pathway, composed of distinct stages or components, arranged in a specific order. Each stage represents a unique operation or transformation that refines the data, molding it into a more suitable format for <span class="No-Break">ML tasks.</span></p>
			<p>At the heart of a pipeline lies its ability to seamlessly connect these stages, forming a well-coordinated flow of transformations. This orchestration ensures that the data flows effortlessly through each stage, with the output of one stage becoming the input for the next. It eradicates the need for manual intervention, automating the entire process and saving us valuable time and effort. We integrate a variety of operations into the pipeline, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and much more. Each operation plays its part in transforming the data, to make it usable for the <span class="No-Break">ML model.</span></p>
			<p>The ML pipeline empowers us to streamline our workflows, experiment with different combinations<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> of <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>transformations, and maintain consistency in our data processing tasks. It provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>structured<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> framework that allows us to effortlessly reproduce and share our work, fostering collaboration and fostering a deeper understanding of the data <span class="No-Break">transformation process.</span></p>
			<p>In ML and data<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> preprocessing, a <strong class="bold">one-hot encoder</strong> is a technique that’s used to convert categorical variables into a numerical format, allowing algorithms to better understand and process categorical data. It’s particularly useful when working with categorical features that lack ordinal relationships or <span class="No-Break">numerical representation.</span></p>
			<p>We will use <strong class="source-inline">StringIndexer</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">OneHotEncoder</strong> in this pipeline. Let’s see how we can <span class="No-Break">achieve this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer
from pyspark.ml.feature import OneHotEncoder
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
mszoning_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="MSZoning", outputCol="MSZoningIndex")
lotconfig_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="LotConfig", outputCol="LotConfigIndex")
bldgtype_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="BldgType", outputCol="BldgTypeIndex")
exterior1st_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="Exterior1st", outputCol="Exterior1stIndex")
onehotencoder_mszoning_vector = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="MSZoningIndex", outputCol="MSZoningVector")
onehotencoder_lotconfig_vector = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="LotConfigIndex", outputCol="LotConfigVector")
onehotencoder_bldgtype_vector = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="BldgTypeIndex", outputCol="BldgTypeVector")
onehotencoder_exterior1st_vector = OneHotEncoder(inputCol="Exterior1stIndex", outputCol="Exterior1stVector")
#Create pipeline and pass all stages
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[mszoning_indexer,
                            lotconfig_indexer,
                            bldgtype_indexer,
                            exterior1st_indexer,
                            onehotencoder_mszoning_vector,
                            onehotencoder_lotconfig_vector,
                            onehotencoder_bldgtype_vector,
                            onehotencoder_exterior1st_vector])</pre>			<p>To begin our<a id="_idIndexMarker677"/> code, we<a id="_idIndexMarker678"/> import the required modules from the PySpark library. The <strong class="source-inline">StringIndexer</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">OneHotEncoder</strong> modules will be used to handle the string columns of the <span class="No-Break">housing dataset.</span></p>
			<p>As we embark <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>on<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> the process of transforming categorical columns into numerical representations that can be understood by ML algorithms, let’s take a closer look at the magic happening in <span class="No-Break">our code.</span></p>
			<p>The first step is to create <strong class="source-inline">StringIndexer</strong> instances for each categorical column we wish to transform. Each instance takes an input column, such as <strong class="source-inline">MSZoning</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">LotConfig</strong>, and produces a corresponding output column with a numerical index. For example, the <strong class="source-inline">MSZoningIndex</strong> column captures the transformed index values of the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">MSZoning</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> column.</span></p>
			<p>With the categorical columns successfully indexed, we progress to the next stage. Now, we want to convert these indices into binary vectors. For that, we can use <strong class="source-inline">OneHotEncoder</strong>. The resulting vectors represent each categorical value as a binary array, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of that category and <span class="No-Break">0 otherwise.</span></p>
			<p>We create <strong class="source-inline">OneHotEncoder</strong> instances for each indexed column, such as <strong class="source-inline">MSZoningIndex</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">LotConfigIndex</strong>, and generate new output columns holding the binary vector representations. These output columns, such as <strong class="source-inline">MSZoningVector</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">LotConfigVector</strong>, are used to capture the <span class="No-Break">encoded information.</span></p>
			<p>As our code progresses, we assemble a pipeline – a sequence of transformations – where each transformation represents a stage. In our case, each stage encompasses the steps of indexing and one-hot encoding for a specific categorical column. We arrange the stages in the pipeline, ensuring the correct order <span class="No-Break">of transformations.</span></p>
			<p>By structuring<a id="_idIndexMarker681"/> our<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> pipeline, we orchestrate a seamless flow of operations. The pipeline connects the dots between different stages, making it effortless to apply these transformations to our dataset as a whole. Our pipeline acts as a conductor, leading our data through the transformations, ultimately making it into a format ready <span class="No-Break">for ML.</span></p>
			<p>Now, we will fit this pipeline to our cleaned dataset so that all the columns can be <span class="No-Break">transformed together:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
df_transformed = pipeline.fit(cleaned_data).transform(cleaned_data)
df_transformed.show(5)</pre>			<p>The resulting DataFrame will have the additional columns that we created in the pipeline with transformation. We have created index and vector columns for each of the <span class="No-Break">string columns.</span></p>
			<p>Now, we need to remove the unnecessary and redundant columns from our dataset. We will do this in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h3>Data cleanup</h3>
			<p>In this step, we will make sure that we are only using the features needed by ML. To achieve this, we will remove different additional columns, such as the identity column, which<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> don’t<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> serve<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>model. Moreover, we will also remove the features that we have already applied transformations to, such as <span class="No-Break">string columns.</span></p>
			<p>The following code shows how to delete <span class="No-Break">the columns:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
drop_column_list = ["Id", "MSZoning","LotConfig","BldgType", "Exterior1st"]
df_dropped_cols = df_transformed.select([column for column in df_transformed.columns if column not in drop_column_list])
df_dropped_cols.columns</pre>			<p>Here’s <span class="No-Break">the result:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
['MSSubClass',
 'LotArea',
 'OverallCond',
 'YearBuilt',
 'YearRemodAdd',
 'BsmtFinSF2',
 'TotalBsmtSF',
 'SalePrice',
 'MSZoningIndex',
 'LotConfigIndex',
 'BldgTypeIndex',
 'Exterior1stIndex',
 'MSZoningVector',
 'LotConfigVector',
 'BldgTypeVector',
 'Exterior1stVector']</pre>			<p>As you can see from the resulting column list, the <strong class="source-inline">Id</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">MSZoning</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">LotConfig</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">BldgType</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Exterior1st</strong> columns have been deleted from the <span class="No-Break">resulting DataFrame.</span></p>
			<p>The next step in the process is assembling <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<h3>Assembling the vector</h3>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>this<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> step, we<a id="_idIndexMarker689"/> will <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>assemble a vector based on the features that we want. This step is necessary for Spark ML to work <span class="No-Break">with data.</span></p>
			<p>The following code captures how we can <span class="No-Break">achieve this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
#Assembling features
feature_assembly = VectorAssembler(inputCols = ['MSSubClass',
 'LotArea',
 'OverallCond',
 'YearBuilt',
 'YearRemodAdd',
 'BsmtFinSF2',
 'TotalBsmtSF',
 'MSZoningIndex',
 'LotConfigIndex',
 'BldgTypeIndex',
 'Exterior1stIndex',
 'MSZoningVector',
 'LotConfigVector',
 'BldgTypeVector',
 'Exterior1stVector'], outputCol = 'features')
output = feature_assembly.transform(df_dropped_cols)
output.show(3)</pre>			<p>In the preceding code block, we have created a features column that contains the assembled vector. We will use this column for our model training after <span class="No-Break">scaling it.</span></p>
			<p>Once the vector has been assembled, the next step in the process is to scale <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<h3>Feature scaling</h3>
			<p>Feature scaling <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>ensures <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>that all features are on a similar scale, preventing<a id="_idIndexMarker693"/> certain<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> features from dominating the <span class="No-Break">learning process.</span></p>
			<p>For this, we can use the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#Normalizing the features
from pyspark.ml.feature import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol="scaledFeatures",withStd=True, withMean=False)
# Compute summary statistics by fitting the StandardScaler
scalerModel = scaler.fit(output)
# Normalize each feature to have unit standard deviation.
scaledOutput = scalerModel.transform(output)
scaledOutput.show(3)</pre>			<p>The following code selects <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>only<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> the scaled features and the target column – that <span class="No-Break">is, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">SalePrice</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#Selecting input and output column from output
df_model_final = scaledOutput.select(['SalePrice', 'scaledFeatures'])
df_model_final.show(3)</pre>			<p>We’ll get the <span class="No-Break">following output:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
+---------+--------------------+
|SalePrice|   scaledFeatures   |
+---------+--------------------+
|   208500|(37,[0,1,2,3,4,6,...|
|   181500|(37,[0,1,2,3,4,6,...|
|   223500|(37,[0,1,2,3,4,6,...|
+---------+--------------------+</pre>			<p>As you can see, <strong class="source-inline">df_model_final</strong> now only has two columns. <strong class="source-inline">SalePrice</strong> is the column that we’re going to predict so that is our target column. <strong class="source-inline">scaledFeatures</strong> contains all the features that we are going to use to train our <span class="No-Break">ML model.</span></p>
			<p>These examples demonstrate common data preparation and feature engineering tasks using PySpark. However, the specific techniques and methods applied may vary, depending on the dataset and the requirements of the ML task. It is essential to understand the <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>characteristics of the data and choose appropriate techniques to preprocess <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>and <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>engineer<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> features effectively. Proper data preparation and feature engineering lay the foundation for building accurate and robust <span class="No-Break">ML models.</span></p>
			<p>The next step in this process is training and evaluating the <span class="No-Break">ML model.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Model training and evaluation</h2>
			<p>Model training and <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>evaluation are crucial steps in the ML process. In this section, we will explore how to train ML models and evaluate their performance using various metrics and techniques. We will use PySpark as the framework for model training <span class="No-Break">and evaluation.</span></p>
			<h3>Splitting the data</h3>
			<p>Before training<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> a model, it is important to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. Here’s an example of how to split the data <span class="No-Break">using PySpark:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#test train split
df_train, df_test = df_model_final.randomSplit([0.75, 0.25])</pre>			<p>In the preceding code, we are doing a random split of the data, putting 75% of the data into the training set and 25% of the data into the test set. There are other split techniques as well. You should look at your data carefully and then define the split that works best for your data and <span class="No-Break">model training.</span></p>
			<p>The reason we split the data is that once we train the model, we want to see how the trained model predicts on a dataset that it has never seen. In this case, that is our test dataset. This would help us evaluate the model and determine the quality of the model. Based on this, we can deploy different techniques to improve <span class="No-Break">our model.</span></p>
			<p>The next step is <span class="No-Break">model training.</span></p>
			<h3>Model training</h3>
			<p>Once the data has been <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>split, we can train an ML model on the training data. PySpark provides a wide range of algorithms for various types of ML tasks. For this example, we are going to use linear regression as our model <span class="No-Break">of choice.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example of training a linear <span class="No-Break">regression model:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
# Instantiate the linear regression model
regressor = LinearRegression(featuresCol = 'scaledFeatures', labelCol = 'SalePrice')
# Fit the model on the training data
regressor = regressor.fit(df_train)</pre>			<p>In the preceding code, we are using the training data and fitting it into a linear regressor model. We also added a parameter for <strong class="source-inline">labelCol</strong> that tells the model that this is the column that is our target column <span class="No-Break">to predict.</span></p>
			<p>Once the model<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> has been trained, the next step is to determine how good the model is. We’ll do this in the next section by evaluating <span class="No-Break">the model.</span></p>
			<h3>Model evaluation</h3>
			<p>After training the <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>model, we need to evaluate its performance on the test data. Evaluation metrics provide insights into how well the model <span class="No-Break">is performing.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Mean squared error</strong> (<strong class="bold">MSE</strong>) is a<a id="_idIndexMarker706"/> fundamental statistical metric that’s used to evaluate the performance of regression models by quantifying the average of the squared differences between predicted and <span class="No-Break">actual values.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">R-squared</strong>, often<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> denoted as <strong class="bold">R2</strong>, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable or explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It serves as an indicator of how well the independent variables explain the variability of the <span class="No-Break">dependent variable.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example of evaluating a regression model using the MSE and <span class="No-Break">R2 metrics:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#MSE for the train data
pred_results = regressor.evaluate(df_train)
print("The train MSE for the model is: %2f"% pred_results.meanAbsoluteError)
print("The train r2 for the model is: %2f"% pred_results.r2)</pre>			<p>Here’s <span class="No-Break">the result:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
The MSE for the model is: 32287.153682
The r2 for the model is: 0.614926</pre>			<p>We can check the test data’s performance as <span class="No-Break">depicted here:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#Checking test performance
pred_results = regressor.evaluate(df_test)
print("The test MSE for the model is: %2f"% pred_results.meanAbsoluteError)
print("The test r2 for the model is: %2f"% pred_results.r2)</pre>			<p>Here’s <span class="No-Break">the result:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
The MSE for the model is: 31668.331218
The r2 for the model is: 0.613300</pre>			<p>Based on the results <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>of the model, we can tune it further. We’ll see some of the techniques to achieve this in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h3>Cross-validation</h3>
			<p>Cross-validation is <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>one of the different methods to improve an ML <span class="No-Break">model’s performance.</span></p>
			<p>Cross-validation is used to assess the model’s performance more robustly by dividing the data into multiple subsets for training and evaluation. So, instead of just using train and test data, we use a validation set as well, where the model never sees that data and is only used for <span class="No-Break">measuring performance.</span></p>
			<p>Cross-validation follows a simple principle: rather than relying on a single train-test split, we divide our dataset into multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> subsets, or <strong class="bold">folds</strong>. Each fold acts as a mini train-test split, with a portion of the data used for training and the remainder reserved for testing. By rotating the folds, we ensure that every data point gets an opportunity to be part of the test set, thereby mitigating biases and providing a more <span class="No-Break">representative evaluation.</span></p>
			<p>The most common form of <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>cross-validation is <strong class="bold">k-fold cross-validation</strong>. In this method, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained and evaluated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once while the remaining folds collectively form the training set. By averaging the performance metrics obtained from each iteration, we obtain a more robust estimation of our <span class="No-Break">model’s performance.</span></p>
			<p>Through cross-validation, we gain valuable insights into the generalization capabilities of our model. It allows us to gauge its performance across different subsets of the data, capturing the inherent variations and nuances that exist within our dataset. This technique helps us detect potential issues such<a id="_idIndexMarker712"/> as <strong class="bold">overfitting</strong>, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training set but fails to generalize to <span class="No-Break">unseen data.</span></p>
			<p>In addition to k-fold cross-validation, there are variations and extensions tailored to specific scenarios. <strong class="bold">Stratified cross-validation</strong> ensures<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset, preserving the representativeness of the<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> splits. <strong class="bold">Leave-one-out cross-validation</strong>, on the other hand, treats each data point as a separate fold, providing a stringent evaluation but at the cost of increased <span class="No-Break">computational </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker715"/></span><span class="No-Break">complexity.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will learn about <span class="No-Break">hyperparameter tuning.</span></p>
			<h3>Hyperparameter tuning</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Hyperparameter tuning</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker716"/> process of optimizing the <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>hyperparameters of an ML algorithm to improve its performance. Hyperparameters are settings or configurations that are external to the model and cannot be learned from the training data directly. Unlike model parameters, which are learned during the training process, hyperparameters need to be specified beforehand and are crucial in determining the behavior and performance of an ML model. We will use hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. <strong class="bold">Hyperparameters</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker718"/> parameters that are not learned from the data but are set before training. Tuning hyperparameters can significantly impact the <span class="No-Break">model’s performance.</span></p>
			<p>Picture this: our model is a complex piece of machinery, composed of various knobs and levers known as hyperparameters. These hyperparameters govern the behavior and characteristics of our model, influencing its ability to learn, generalize, and make accurate predictions. However, finding the optimal configuration for these hyperparameters is no <span class="No-Break">easy feat.</span></p>
			<p>Hyperparameter tuning is the art of systematically searching and selecting the best combination of hyperparameters for our model. It allows us to venture beyond default settings and discover the configurations that align harmoniously with our data, extracting the most meaningful insights and delivering <span class="No-Break">superior performance.</span></p>
			<p>The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to get optimal values. We explore different hyperparameter settings, traversing through a multidimensional landscape of possibilities. This exploration can take various forms, such as grid search, random search, or more advanced techniques such as Bayesian optimization or <span class="No-Break">genetic algorithms.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Grid search</strong>, a popular<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> method, involves defining a grid of potential values for each hyperparameter. The model is then trained and evaluated for every possible combination within the grid. By exhaustively searching through the grid, we unearth the configuration that yields the highest performance, providing us with a solid foundation for <span class="No-Break">further refinement.</span></p>
			<p>Random search takes a different approach. It samples hyperparameter values randomly from predefined distributions and evaluates the model’s performance for each sampled configuration. This randomized exploration enables us to cover a wider range of possibilities, potentially discovering unconventional yet highly <span class="No-Break">effective configurations.</span></p>
			<p>These examples demonstrate the process of model training and evaluation using PySpark. However, the specific algorithms, evaluation metrics, and techniques applied may vary, depending <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>on the ML task at hand. It is important to<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> understand the problem domain, select appropriate algorithms, and choose relevant evaluation metrics to train and evaluate <span class="No-Break">models effectively.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Model deployment</h2>
			<p>Model deployment is <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>the process of making trained ML models available for use in production environments. In this section, we will explore various approaches and techniques for deploying ML <span class="No-Break">models effectively:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Serialization and persistence</strong>: Once a<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> model has been trained, it needs to be serialized and persisted to disk for later use. Serialization is the process of converting the model object into a format that can be stored, while persistence involves saving the serialized model to a <span class="No-Break">storage system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model serving</strong>: Model serving involves making the trained model available as an API endpoint or service that can receive input data and return predictions. This allows other applications or systems to integrate and use the model for <span class="No-Break">real-time predictions.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Model monitoring and management</h2>
			<p>Once a model has<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> been deployed, it is important to monitor its performance and behavior in the production environment and maintain its effectiveness over time. Monitoring can help identify issues such as data drift, model degradation, or anomalies. Additionally, model management involves versioning, tracking, and maintaining multiple versions of the deployed models. These practices ensure that models remain up to date and perform optimally over time. In this section, we will explore the key aspects of model monitoring <span class="No-Break">and maintenance:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability and performance</strong>: When <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>deploying ML models, scalability and performance are essential considerations. Models should be designed and deployed in a way that allows for efficient processing of large volumes of data and can handle high throughput requirements. Technologies such as Apache Spark provide distributed computing capabilities that enable scalable and high-performance <span class="No-Break">model deployment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model updates and retraining</strong>: ML models may need to be updated or retrained periodically to adapt to changing data patterns or improve performance. Deployed models should have mechanisms in place to facilitate updates and retraining without interrupting the serving process. This can involve automated processes, such as monitoring for data drift or retraining triggers based on <span class="No-Break">specific conditions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance metrics</strong>: To monitor a deployed model, it is important to define and track relevant performance metrics. These metrics can vary, depending on the type of<a id="_idIndexMarker726"/> ML problem and the specific requirements of the application. Some commonly used performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and <strong class="bold">area under the ROC curve</strong> (<strong class="bold">AUC</strong>). By regularly evaluating these metrics, deviations from<a id="_idIndexMarker727"/> the expected performance can be identified, indicating the need for further investigation or <span class="No-Break">maintenance actions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data drift detection</strong>: Data drift refers to the phenomenon where the statistical properties of the input data change over time, leading to a degradation in model performance. Monitoring for data drift is crucial to ensure that the deployed model continues to provide accurate predictions. Techniques such as statistical tests, feature distribution comparison, and outlier detection can be employed to detect data drift. When data drift is detected, it may be necessary to update the model or retrain it using more <span class="No-Break">recent data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model performance monitoring</strong>: Monitoring the performance of a deployed model involves tracking its predictions and comparing them with ground truth values. This can be done by periodically sampling a subset of the predictions and evaluating them against the actual outcomes. Monitoring can also include analyzing prediction errors, identifying patterns or anomalies, and investigating the root causes of any performance degradation. By regularly monitoring the model’s performance, issues can be identified early on and corrective actions can <span class="No-Break">be taken.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model retraining and updates</strong>: Models that are deployed in production may require periodic updates or retraining to maintain their effectiveness. When new data becomes available or significant changes occur in the application domain, retraining the model with fresh data can help improve its performance. Additionally, bug<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> fixes, feature <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>enhancements, or algorithmic improvements may necessitate updating the deployed model. It is important to have a well-defined process and infrastructure in place to handle model retraining and <span class="No-Break">updates efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Versioning and model governance</strong>: Maintaining proper versioning and governance of deployed models is crucial for tracking changes, maintaining reproducibility, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Version control systems can be used to manage model versions, track changes, and provide a historical record of model updates. Additionally, maintaining documentation related to model changes, dependencies, and associated processes contributes to effective <span class="No-Break">model governance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration and feedback</strong>: Model monitoring and maintenance often involve collaboration among different stakeholders, including data scientists, engineers, domain experts, and business users. Establishing channels for feedback and communication can facilitate the exchange of insights, identification of issues, and implementation of necessary changes. Regular meetings or<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> feedback loops can help align the model’s performance with the evolving requirements of <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, model deployment is a critical step in the ML life cycle. It involves serializing and persisting trained models, serving them as APIs or services, monitoring their performance, ensuring scalability and performance, and managing updates <span class="No-Break">and retraining.</span></p>
			<p>By actively monitoring and maintaining deployed models, organizations can ensure that their ML systems continue to provide accurate and reliable predictions. Effective model monitoring techniques, coupled with proactive maintenance strategies, enable timely identification of performance issues and support the necessary actions to keep the models up to date <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>and aligned with <span class="No-Break">business objectives.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Model iteration and improvement</h2>
			<p>Model iteration and <a id="_idIndexMarker732"/>improvement is a crucial phase in the ML life cycle that focuses on enhancing the performance and effectiveness of deployed models. By continuously refining and optimizing models, organizations can achieve better predictions and drive greater value from their ML initiatives. In this section, we will explore the key aspects of model iteration <span class="No-Break">and improvement:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collecting feedback and gathering insights</strong>: The first step in model iteration and<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> improvement is to gather feedback from various stakeholders, including end users, domain experts, and business teams. Feedback can provide valuable insights into the model’s performance, areas for improvement, and potential issues encountered in real-world scenarios. This feedback can be collected through surveys, user interviews, or monitoring the model’s behavior in the <span class="No-Break">production environment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analyzing model performance</strong>: To identify areas for improvement, it is important to thoroughly analyze the model’s performance. This includes examining performance metrics, evaluating prediction errors, and conducting in-depth analyses of misclassified or poorly predicted instances. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model, data scientists can focus their efforts on specific areas that <span class="No-Break">require attention.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Exploring new features and data</strong>: One way to improve model performance is by incorporating new features or utilizing additional data sources. Exploratory data analysis can help identify potential features that may have a strong impact on predictions. Feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms, scaling, or transforming variables, can also be employed to enhance the representation of the data. Additionally, incorporating new data from different sources can provide fresh insights and improve the model’s <span class="No-Break">generalization capabilities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning</strong>: Experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters can lead to significant improvements in model performance. Data scientists can explore alternative algorithms or variations of the <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>existing algorithm to identify the best approach for the given problem. Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, can be used to find optimal values for model parameters. This iterative process helps identify the best algorithm and parameter settings that yield <span class="No-Break">superior results.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensemble methods</strong>: Ensemble methods involve combining multiple models to create a<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> more robust and accurate prediction. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, or stacking can be applied to build an ensemble model from multiple base models. Ensemble methods can often improve model performance by reducing bias, variance, and overfitting. Experimenting with different ensemble strategies and model combinations can lead to further enhancements in <span class="No-Break">prediction accuracy.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A/B testing and controlled experiments</strong>: A/B testing or controlled experiments can be conducted to evaluate the impact of model improvements in a controlled setting. By randomly assigning users or data samples to different versions of the model, organizations can measure the performance of the new model against the existing one. This approach provides statistically significant results to determine if the proposed changes lead to desired improvements <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous monitoring and evaluation</strong>: Once the improved model has been deployed, continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential to ensure its ongoing performance. Monitoring for data drift, analyzing performance metrics, and conducting periodic evaluations help identify potential degradation or the need for further improvements. This feedback loop allows for continuous iteration and<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> refinement of the <span class="No-Break">deployed model.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By embracing a culture of iteration and improvement, organizations can continuously enhance the performance and accuracy of their ML models. Through collecting feedback, analyzing model performance, exploring new features and algorithms, conducting <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>experiments, and continuous monitoring, models can be iteratively refined to achieve better predictions and drive tangible <span class="No-Break">business outcomes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Case studies and real-world examples</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>explore two prominent use cases of ML: customer churn prediction and fraud detection. These examples demonstrate the practical applications of ML techniques in addressing real-world challenges and achieving significant <span class="No-Break">business value.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Customer churn prediction</h2>
			<p>Customer churn <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company, typically by canceling a subscription or switching to a competitor. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to proactively identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take appropriate actions to retain them. ML models can analyze various customer attributes and behavior patterns to predict churn likelihood. Let’s dive into a customer churn prediction <span class="No-Break">case study.</span></p>
			<h3>Case study – telecommunications company</h3>
			<p>A telecommunications company wants to reduce customer churn by predicting which customers are most likely to cancel their subscriptions. The company collects extensive customer data, including demographics, call records, service usage, and customer complaints. By leveraging ML, they aim to identify key indicators of churn and build a predictive model to forecast <span class="No-Break">future churners:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data preparation</strong>: The company gathers and preprocesses the customer data, ensuring it is cleaned, formatted, and ready for analysis. They combine customer profiles with historical churn information to create a <span class="No-Break">labeled dataset.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature engineering</strong>: To capture meaningful patterns, the company engineers relevant features from the available data. These features may include variables such as average call duration, number of complaints, monthly service usage, <span class="No-Break">and tenure.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model selection and training</strong>: The company selects an appropriate ML algorithm, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, to build the churn prediction model. They split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the <span class="No-Break">testing data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model evaluation</strong>: The model’s performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The company analyzes the model’s ability to correctly identify churners and non-churners, striking a balance between false positives and <span class="No-Break">false negatives.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model deployment and monitoring</strong>: Once the model meets the desired performance criteria, it is deployed into the production environment. The model continuously monitors incoming customer data, generates churn predictions, and triggers<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> appropriate retention strategies for <span class="No-Break">at-risk customers.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Fraud detection</h2>
			<p>Fraud detection is <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>another critical application of ML that aims to identify fraudulent activities and prevent financial losses. ML models can learn patterns of fraudulent behavior from historical data and flag suspicious transactions or activities in real time. Let’s explore a fraud detection <span class="No-Break">case study.</span></p>
			<h3>Case study – financial institution</h3>
			<p>A financial institution wants to detect fraudulent transactions in real time to protect its customers and prevent monetary losses. The institution collects transaction data, including transaction amounts, timestamps, merchant information, and customer details. By leveraging ML algorithms, they aim to build a robust fraud <span class="No-Break">detection system:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data preprocessing</strong>: The financial institution processes and cleans the transaction data, ensuring data integrity and consistency. They may also enrich the data by incorporating additional information, such as IP addresses or device identifiers, to enhance fraud <span class="No-Break">detection capabilities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature engineering</strong>: Relevant features are extracted from the transaction data to capture potential indicators of fraudulent activity. These features may include transaction amounts, frequency, geographical location, deviation from typical spending patterns, and customer <span class="No-Break">transaction history.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Model training</strong>: The financial institution selects suitable ML algorithms, such as anomaly detection techniques or supervised learning methods (for example, logistic regression and gradient boosting), to train the fraud detection model. The model is trained on historical data labeled as fraudulent <span class="No-Break">or non-fraudulent.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Real-time monitoring</strong>: Once the model has been trained, it is deployed to analyze incoming transactions in real time. The model assigns a fraud probability score to each transaction, and transactions exceeding a certain threshold are flagged for further investigation <span class="No-Break">or intervention.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong>: The financial institution continuously refines the fraud detection model by monitoring its performance and incorporating new data. They periodically evaluate the model’s effectiveness, adjust thresholds, and update the model to adapt to evolving fraud patterns <span class="No-Break">and techniques.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By applying ML techniques to customer churn prediction and fraud detection, organizations can <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>enhance their decision-making processes, improve customer retention, and mitigate financial risks. These case studies highlight the practical application of ML in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its value in <span class="No-Break">various industries.</span></p>
