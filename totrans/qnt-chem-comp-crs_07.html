			<p>The initial <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>quantum circuit model of computation as a time-ordered sequence of logical quantum gates performing a unitary evolution of the state of a quantum register has evolved into a tightly integrated model of dynamic quantum circuits that allow concurrent classical processing of mid-circuit measurement results [Corcoles] [IBM_mid]. This new paradigm of dynamic quantum computation paves the way to a smooth transition from classical to quantum-boosted computing.</p>
			<p>An often-overlooked potential quantum advantage is the energy efficiency of quantum computation [Auffeves] [Q Daily] [Quantum_AI] [Thibault]. The quantum supremacy experiment [Arute] involved an energy consumption three orders of magnitude smaller than the one a high-performance computer would require to achieve an exact computation of the expected result of the experiment. Determining the conditions under which an energetic quantum advantage could be achieved is an open research topic [Auffeves].</p>
			<p>The recent demonstration of a new <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>quantum register of fermion pairs where information is stored in the vibrational motion of atom pairs held in a superposition of two vibrational states opens the perspective of programmable quantum simulators of molecules [Hartke]. The accurate calculations of the vibrational spectra of molecules, which have applications from astrochemistry to biochemistry and climate change mitigation, might be easier to achieve on a quantum computer than electronic energy calculations [Sawaya].</p>

With the simplest basis (STO-3G), and with a noise-free simulation of a quantum circuit (statevector simulator), the different methods of calculations were in good agreement.</p>
			<p>Scientific or industrial applications require highly accurate relative energy estimates of about 1 milli-Hartree (mHA) or even 0.1 mHA of chemical reaction mechanisms. The same accuracy is required for the total electronic energy of each molecule species involved in a chemical reaction of interest [Burg]. The authors of a benchmark of algorithms for calculating the electronic structures of molecules of relevance to prebiotic chemistry have concluded that "To utilize VQE and achieve near chemical accuracy will be extremely challenging for NISQ processors" [Lolur]. They point out that the main challenge is the large number of Pauli terms resulting from the mapping of fermionic to qubit Hamiltonian, the large number of variational parameters, and the large number of energy evaluations. Furthermore, to get an accurate energy estimate of 1 mHA, the ansatz for the VQE must be close to the true ground state by less than one in a million [Troyer]. </p>
			<p>In <a href="B18268_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor228"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Beyond Born-Oppenheimer,</em> we explained how non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) calculations include the effects that are needed to make better predictions of chemical states at above ground state vibrations. Implementing these non-BO calculations with innovative hybrid classical-quantum algorithms is an open research topic. Ryan Babbush, head of Google's quantum algorithms team, has developed the first quantized quantum simulations algorithms for chemistry. In the introduction of his presentation of these algorithms [Babbush], he stated that there are lots of contexts where non-BO simulations are important, such as low temperatures where hydrogen bondings are involved, or tunneling or couplings between electrons and nuclei, or to compute dynamics, reactive scattering coefficients, or thermo rate constants directly from quantum dynamics. A study of these algorithms [Su] has shown potential advantages to algorithms in second quantization<a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>. However, these algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum computers with several thousand logical qubits able to run quantum circuits with a huge number of gates (<img src="Images/Formula_07_001.png" alt="" width="84" height="46"/> to <img src="Images/Formula_07_002.png" alt="" width="91" height="51"/>), way beyond the capabilities of the current or near-term NISQ-era processors.</p>
