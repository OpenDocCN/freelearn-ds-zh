- en: In general, most algorithms have one oracle function; however, there are some
    algorithms that require more than one, or multiple runs of a function, such as
    the Grover algorithm, which repeats the oracle and diffusion operator function
    based on the number of qubits of the circuit.

    observe the change in the circuit’s oracle representing each of the three values.
    Since all are 3 qubits in length, the repetition will be the same for each value
    (just once).
