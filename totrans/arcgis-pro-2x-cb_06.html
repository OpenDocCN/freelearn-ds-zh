<p>One of the things that makes GIS such a powerful visualization and analytical tool is the ability to overlay multiple layers of information together in a map. Putting our GIS data in real-world coordinate systems and projections is how we are able to do this. By placing our data in a real-world system, we tie it to the Earth. This allows us to locate features anywhere on the Earth’s surface and then bring them into a map so we can see how those features are related spatially.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of coordinate systems we can use in ArcGIS Pro, geographic and projected. A geographic coordinate system is based on a 3D model of the earth, called the ellipsoid or spheroid. The ellipsoid is then tied back to the physical Earth by the datum. Geographic coordinate systems use degrees as their primary unit of measurement.</p>
<p>Each degree can then be broken down into different sub-units, such as decimal degrees, minutes, decimal minutes, or minutes, and seconds. You will often hear geographic coordinate systems referred to as <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-865 image-border" height="197" src="assets/65b4855a-54af-4d92-9b4e-8dfd19fe0f40.png" width="268"/></div>
<p>The primarily lines of reference used in a geographic coordinate system are the <strong>Equator</strong> and the <strong>Prime Meridian</strong>.  These are the starting points for determining the latitude and longitude values required to locate a feature's position. Geographic coordinate systems can be used to identify the location of a feature on the Earth very accurately. However, as the diagram illustrates, the distance between the lines of latitude and longitude are not consistent. It varies depending where on the Earth you are located. This makes it difficult to measure distances and areas. This is where projected coordinate systems come in.</p>
<p>Projected coordinate systems locate and display data in a 2D plane, using a cartesian coordinate system. This allows us to apply standard units of linear measurement, such as feet and meters. The origin of the projected coordinate system is tied to a geographic coordinate system. This is what ties the projected coordinate system to the earth. From the origin, an <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axis is defined, along with the units, as illustrated in the following diagram. Because projected coordinate systems use uniform units, we are able to easily measure distances and areas:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866 image-border" height="258" src="assets/5d401606-6f0d-4086-9379-9087a548e93e.png" width="430"/></div>
<p>Of course, taking a 3D surface such as the Earth and flattening it does introduce distortions into our data. So, we have different methods of projecting the data from a 3D model to a 2D plane to reduce these distortions. There are three basic types of projections, planar, conic, and cylindrical. From there they can get more advanced.</p>
<p>As long as all your data is in a real-world coordinate system, regardless of what type, ArcGIS Pro can display it in a single map or scene, even if the layers are in different coordinate systems. It will project the data on the fly in that map or scene to a common coordinate system. So, it is important that all your spatial data is assigned the correct coordinate system. Otherwise your data may be displayed incorrectly and results of your analysis might be incorrect.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to work with coordinate systems within ArcGIS Pro. You will start by learning how to determine the coordinate system for an existing map. Then you will learn how to set the coordinate system for a new map. Next, you will learn how to change the coordinate system for an existing map. Then you will learn how to define the coordinate system for data. Lastly you will learn how to project data from one coordinate system to another.   </p>

<p>Every map and scene you create in ArcGIS Pro makes use of a coordinate system in order to display data in a location. However, it not only can impact how and where features are displayed, but also what you can do with the map. The coordinate system used by a map can impact if you can share it as a web map via ArcGIS Online, how well layers overlay one another, and more. So, it is important to know what coordinate system your map is using.</p>
<p>The first layer you add to the map will define the coordinate system for that map. But what if you are working with an existing map, maybe one that was created by someone else? How do you determine the coordinate system for the existing map you are working with?</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to determine which coordinate system has been assigned to an existing map.   </p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you moved your mouse within the map while watching the coordinate display, you should have seen the values change. The first value displayed is the X value for the location of your mouse pointer within the map. The second value is the Y value for the location of your pointer. The display is in US feet, as indicated by the <span class="packt_screen">ftUS</span> located to the right of the coordinates.</p>

<p>When working with projected coordinate systems, you may see the X value also referred to as the <strong>Easting</strong> and the Y as the <strong>Northing</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Looking at the values in the coordinate display can help you determine what type of coordinate system your map may be in, Geographic or Projected. X values greater than 180 and Y values greater than 90 might indicate that your map is using a projected coordinate system.</p>

<p>You now know how to determine the coordinate system for an existing map. It is important to know what coordinate system you are working with because it forms the foundation for how layers interact with each other spatially. If a map is not assigned a coordinate system, then you will not be able to bring layers together into a single map and expect them to overlay one another properly. </p>

<p>You now know how to determine the coordinate system assigned to existing maps. But how do you assign one to a new map? That is pretty easy. As was mentioned earlier, the first layer you add to a new map will set the coordinate system for the map.  </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a new map in the project you used in the previous recipe. You will then see what coordinate system has been assigned to the new map. Next, you will add a new layer to the map and see what that does to the coordinate system for your map. Lastly, you will add another layer to the map that is in a different coordinate system, and check to see if that changes the coordinate system for your map.  </p>

<p>You can now set the coordinate system for any new map that you create. This is important for the same reason that you need to know the coordinate system of any existing map you may work with: GIS is reliant on the use of real world coordinate systems to properly display the location of data within our maps. As long as the data we use is in and properly assigned the correct coordinate system, ArcGIS Pro is able display the data in the common coordinate system we assign to a map. </p>

<p>You now know how to determine the coordinate system for an existing map, and how to set one for a new map. But how do you change the coordinate system for a map or scene?</p>
<p>You might be wondering why you would want to change the coordinate system for a map. There are several reasons why you might want to change the coordinate system assigned to a map. As mentioned in the introduction, some coordinate systems are better suited for specific operations. If you need to measure areas or distances for analysis or editing, a projected coordinate system is best, especially for small areas such as a county, city, or district. If you are trying to show locations of features across large areas, such as a country or the world, then a geographic coordinate system is often best. If you are publishing as a web map then it might require the map be in the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) coordinate system to conform with other datasets. So, if you need to do one of these and your map is in a different coordinate system, you might need to change it. Luckily it is not hard to change the coordinate system for a map, as you are about to see.</p>
<p>Changing the coordinate system for a map does not change the coordinate system for the underlying data referenced in the map. This means that if you have a shapefile in your map as a layer, and that shapefile is in NAD 83 UTM Zone 16N Meters, then if you change the Map Coordinate system to the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere), this will not change the coordinate system the shapefile is stored in. In other words, changing the coordinate system of the map does not project the data it references to a new coordinate system. You will learn how to project data to a different coordinate system later in this chapter.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how you can change the coordinate system used within a map.</p>

<li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro before starting this recipe, you will need to start ArcGIS Pro and open the <kbd>CoordinateSystems.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter6\CoordinateSystems</kbd> using the skills you have learned in past recipes. If you are continuing from the previous recipe, the project should already be open and you can continue to the next step. </li>
<li>Make sure the Basic Map of Trippville is the active map in the map view. If the map is still open, click on the tab for the <span class="packt_screen">Basic Map of Trippville</span> at the top of the map view area, as illustrated in the following screenshot. If you closed the map during a past recipe, you will need to reopen it. To reopen the map, expand the <span class="packt_screen">Maps</span> folder in the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane. Then right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Basic Map of Trippville</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Maps</span> folder and select Open from the menu that appears, as illustrated:</li>

</ol>
<p><span>As you have just verified, the coordinate system for the layer source has not changed. It is still being stored in the same coordinate system it has always been in. So just changing the coordinate system for the map does not change the source data's coordinate system. It only changes how it is displayed in that specific map. ArcGIS Pro projects the data on the fly from the coordinate system it is stored in to that the map is displaying. This is very useful when working with data from multiple organizations which may not use the same coordinate system as yours. One thing to remember though is that projecting on the fly does use more computer resources and will slow down the rendering of the data every time you pan or zoom in the map. </span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You now know how to assign and change the coordinate system used in a map. Maps are not the only thing that are assigned a coordinate system. Our data is also assigned a coordinate system, or at least it should be. If your data is not assigned a coordinate system then ArcGIS Pro may not be able to display the correct location with all your other data. This is also true if your data is assigned the wrong coordinate system.</p>
<p>Where is the coordinate system information stored within your data? Well, that depends on what type of data you are working with. If it is a feature class stored in a geodatabase, then the coordinate system information is stored within the geodatabase itself. If you are working with shapefiles, then the assigned coordinate system is stored in a file with a .prj file extension.</p>
<p>If you are working with CAD data, meaning <kbd>.dwg</kbd>, <kbd>.dxf</kbd>, or <kbd>.dgn</kbd> files, then you will also need a <kbd>.prj</kbd> file in order for ArcGIS Pro to know what coordinate system it is in. While some CAD files can be assigned a coordinate system within the drawing itself, ArcGIS Pro cannot access that part of the file, so you must have an external <kbd>.prj</kbd> file.</p>
<p>As you saw in <a href="b6f25e84-28a9-4d2d-aaca-3550460d4650.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <span><em>Creating and Storing Data</em>,</span> in the <em>Creating a new Geodatabase</em> recipe, when you create a new feature class in a geodatabase, you are asked to assign the coordinate system as part of the Create Feature Class tool. So, in most cases, when you create new feature classes or shapefiles, you will assign the coordinate system for that data as you create it. However, you will find that many existing or legacy datasets do not have a coordinate system defined. This is true mostly for shapefiles and CAD files.  </p>
<p>Just because a dataset does not have an assigned coordinate system does not mean it was not created in a real-world coordinate system. The majority of all shapefiles are created in a real-world coordinate system. They are just missing the <kbd>.prj</kbd> file required by ArcGIS Pro and other Esri products to know what the coordinate system is. The same is true of many CAD files as well, though you will encounter a larger number of CAD files that are not in a real-world coordinate system. You will learn more about that in a later chapter. If the data that is missing from the coordinate system was created in the same coordinate system as the rest of your data, you can still use it for maps, to perform analysis, and more, without defining the coordinate system for the data. It is when you try to mix data in different coordinate systems that you will start to encounter problems if you try to publish the data to a web service or convert it to another format. So, it is generally considered best practice to always define a coordinate system for all your data.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will learn how to define a coordinate system for data that does not have one. In this case, it will be a CAD file that was created in a real-world coordinate system, which is different from all your other data.</p>

<p>This recipe illustrates the importance of having a coordinate system assigned to your GIS data. As you saw, without it, the data will not display in the correct location. This makes it impossible to use as part of a map or to perform analysis. It is also not unusual to get data which has been assigned the wrong coordinate system. The behavior and process described in this recipe can also be used to assign the correct coordinate system to data that has been wrongly assigned. </p>

<p>You now know how to change the coordinate system for a map, and how to assign one to data that is missing a coordinate system. But how do you change the coordinate system for data? That process is called projecting data.</p>
<p>When you need to move or project data from one coordinate system to another, it requires a lot more than just redefining the assigned coordinate system like you did in the previous recipe. It requires ArcGIS Pro to recalculate all the coordinate values for the features within that dataset. This means all those features will have new coordinates that represent values in the coordinate system it has moved to. To calculate the new coordinate values, ArcGIS Pro must perform many calculations for each feature to account for possible changes in datums, units, reference locations, earth models, and more. So, it can take a long time for larger datasets.</p>
<p>The tool you use to move data from one coordinate system to another is the Project tool. This tool is located in the Data Management Tools toolbox and the Projections and Transformations toolset. In this recipe, you will use the Project tool to move data from one coordinate system to another. You will project the Trippville City Limits from its current coordinate system to the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) coordinate system for publishing to ArcGIS Online.</p>

<li>If you closed ArcGIS Pro before starting this recipe, you will need to start ArcGIS Pro. Then open the <kbd>CoordinateSystems.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter6\CoordinateSystems</kbd> using the skills you have learned in past recipes. If you did not close ArcGIS Pro when you completed the previous recipe, the project should already be open and you can continue. </li>
<li>Make sure the <span class="packt_screen">Basic Map of Trippville</span> is the active map in the map view. If you are not sure how to do this, refer back to <em>step 2</em> in the <em>Changing the coordinate system of a map</em> recipe located in this chapter.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane, double-click on the <span class="packt_screen">City Limits</span> layer to open the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Properties</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Source</span> option in the left panel of the window.</li>
<li>In the right panel of the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Properties</span> window, scroll through the options until you get to <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Reference</span>.</li>
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Reference</span> option and answer the following question:</li>

<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the Projected Coordinate system for the City Limits layer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You can see that the City Limits layer is being stored in the NAD 1983 State Plane Georgia West coordinate system. You want to project this layer so that it is in the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) coordinate system, so it will be easier to integrate with other online content. The WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) coordinate system is the one used by most public mapping websites, such as Google Earth, Bing Maps, and Esri ArcGIS Online:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">Notice that a Geographic Transformation is automatically applied. Transformations apply mathematical adjustments when projecting data, to account for differences in datums. The original coordinate system for the City Limits layer referenced the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 1983). The WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere) coordinate system references the WGS 84 datum. While these are both Earth-centered datums, they are slightly different. That difference must be accounted for when the data is projected. That is what the transformation does.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Also, note that the Project tool creates a new feature class, leaving the original one intact. This provides a safety net in case you were to select the wrong output coordinate system:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">You should get two warnings, as illustrated in the screenshot. Warnings are signified by exclamation points in a yellow triangle. Warnings indicate something that violates recommended settings or practices, but which will not stop the web layer from publishing. Errors, on the other hand, will cause the publishing of the web layer to fail:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="404" src="assets/90b7dfd5-b0ed-4206-96c6-8f51e94ef491.png" width="356"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The first warning, as shown, indicates that a layer is missing a feature template. Since you are not allowing editing of this layer when it is published to the web, this is not going to be a problem and can be ignored. The second warning, indicating that the layer’s data source is not supported, is referring to the Basemap. We are not concerned with the basemap since one can be added in ArcGIS Online if you use the City_Limits_Web layer in a web map. You will learn more about creating web maps in <a href="4ba4882e-2afc-4bb8-9906-cb4ef46722ca.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Introducing ArcGIS Online</em> and <a href="9ed15eab-33d0-4c1e-a272-5ed54842381a.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Publishing Your Own Content to ArcGIS Online</em>. These warnings should not adversely impact the publishing of the layer to the web.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> button at the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Share As Web Layer</span> pane. This will publish this layer to ArcGIS Online. Depending on your web connection, this operation might take some time to complete.</li>
<li>Once the tool has successfully published the web layer, click on <span class="packt_screen">Manage the web layer</span>, located at the bottom of the tool, as illustrated in the following<span> screenshot</span>. This will launch your web browser and take you to your ArcGIS Online login screen:</li>

<li>Save your project.</li>
<li>Close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have just projected a layer to a new coordinate system using the Project tool. You projected the City Limits layer to the coordinate system used by most web mapping applications, so it could be more easily integrated with other web-based GIS data in the future, then you published that layer to ArcGIS Online. Next, you viewed the new layer that you published in a web map via the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer. In <a href="4ba4882e-2afc-4bb8-9906-cb4ef46722ca.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <span><em>Introducing ArcGIS Online</em>,</span> you will learn more about ArcGIS Online and how you can use it to share and access data with those both in and outside your organization.</p>
