			<p>spaCy is an industrial-grade, efficient NLP Python library. It offers various pre-trained models and ready-to-use features. <em class="italic">Mastering spaCy</em> provides you with end-to-end coverage of spaCy features and real-world applications.</p>
			<p>You'll begin by installing spaCy and downloading models, before progressing to spaCy's features and prototyping real-world NLP apps. Next, you'll get accustomed to visualizing with spaCy's popular visualizer displaCy. The book also equips you with practical illustrations for pattern matching and helps you advance into the world of semantics with word vectors. Statistical information extraction methods are also explained in detail. Later, you'll cover an interactive business case study that shows you how to combine spaCy features to create a real-world NLP pipeline. You'll implement ML models such as sentiment analysis, intent recognition, and context resolution. The book further focuses on classification with popular frameworks such as TensorFlow's Keras API together with spaCy. You'll cover popular topics, including intent classification and sentiment analysis as well as using them on popular datasets and interpreting the classification results.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to confidently use spaCy, including its linguistic features, word vectors, and classifiers, to create your own NLP apps.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for data scientists and machine learners who want to excel in NLP as well as NLP developers who want to master spaCy and build applications with it. Language and speech professionals who want to get hands-on with Python and spaCy and software developers who want to quickly prototype applications with spaCy will also find this book helpful. Beginner-level knowledge of the Python programming language is required to get the most out of this book. A beginner-level understanding of linguistic terminology, such as parsing, POS tags, and semantic similarity, will also be useful.</p>

You will use morphological features, POS-tags, regex, and other spaCy features to form pattern objects to feed to the spaCy Matcher objects. </p>
			<p><a href="B16570_05_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Word Vectors and Semantic Similarity</em>, teaches you about word vectors and associated semantic similarity methods. This chapter includes word vector computations such as distance calculations, analogy calculations, and visualization.</p>
			<p><a href="B16570_06_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor103"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Putting Everything Together: Semantic Parsing with spaCy</em>, is a fully hands-on chapter. This chapter teaches you how to design a ticket reservation system NLU for <strong class="bold">Airline Travel Information System</strong> (<strong class="bold">ATIS</strong>), a well-known airplane ticket reservation system dataset, with spaCy.</p>
			<p><a href="B16570_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Customizing spaCy Models</em>, teaches you how to train, store, and use custom statistical pipeline components. You will learn how to update an existing statistical pipeline component with your own data as well as how to create a statistical pipeline component from scratch with your own data and labels.</p>
			<p><a href="B16570_08_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor137"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Text Classification with spaCy</em>, teaches you how to do a very basic and popular task of NLP: text classification. This chapter explores text classification with spaCy's <code>Textcategorizer</code> component as well as text classification with TensorFlow and Keras.</p>
			<p><a href="B16570_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">spaCy and Transformers</em>, explores the latest hot topic in NLP – transformers – and how to use them with TensorFlow and spaCy. You'll learn how to work with BERT and TensorFlow as well as transformer-based pretrained pipelines of spaCy v3.0.</p>
			<p><a href="B16570_10_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Putting Everything Together: Designing Your Chatbot with spaCy,</em> takes you into the world of Conversational AI.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>First of all, you'll need Python 3 installed and working on your system. Code examples are tested with spaCy v3.0, however, most of the code is compatible with spaCy v2.3 due to backwards compatibility. For the helper libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, the latest versions available on pip will work. We use TensorFlow, transformers, and helper libraries starting with <a href="B16570_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Customizing spaCy Models</em>, so you can install these libraries by the time you reach <a href="B16570_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>.</p>
