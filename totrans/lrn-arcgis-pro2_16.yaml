    **Computer-Aided Design** (**CAD**) file, or **raster**, you select the layer
    file instead. When you do that, your layer will be added to your map with all
    the properties preconfigured, so you don't need to go back and set all the layer
    properties manually. This can save you valuable time.

    active and the settings for each of those layers. Map files can be created for
    either a two- or three-dimensional scene from an ArcGIS Pro project. Map files

    important to remember that a map or scene in ArcGIS Pro is just one component
    of a project. Unlike a map document in ArcMap, which is often called a map, maps
    in ArcGIS Pro are a single item and do not include things such as layouts and
    other maps (these are called data frames in ArcMap).

    you have learned, maps and layouts don't actually store the GIS data that they
    reference. Instead, they point to the original source. The source can be a database
    stored within the project folder structure or it might be located someplace else
    entirely. It is even possible for a project, map, and layout to include multiple
    layers, all of which reference data from completely different sources.

- en: This is why it is difficult to share your work with those who are not able to
    connect to the same resources you are using. You can't just send them a map or
    layer file because neither of those includes the underlying data. You could possibly
    zip the project folders together into a single file that you could email or put
    on a **File Transfer Protocol** (**FTP**) site for download, but that only works
    if all the data that you use within a project is stored in the project structure.

    referenced data so that you can then share it with those not on your network.

    of the data in the state that it was in when you created the package. This provides
    you with a backup of the data at that point, which you can reference later as

    settings for a layer so that when it is added to a map those settings are automatically
    applied. In addition to saving those settings, a layer package also includes the
    data referenced by the layer. This means a layer package can be shared with someone
    who does not have access to your data. They can then add the layer package to
    a map and see the layer with your settings and the data in the state it was when
    it was packaged.

    unneeded layers from the map to keep the map package size to a minimum. Turning
    off layers' visibility will not cut it. Non-visible layers will still be included

    it to ArcGIS Online. You have set the extents so that when users zoom to the full
    extent in ArcGIS Pro or use the Home button found in most web applications, they
    do not end up zooming out to the entire planet.

    Zoning layer. Then, you configured the metadata for the map. This is used by search
    engines and tools to locate items. Fully configuring the map's metadata is often
    required before ArcGIS Pro will allow you to publish to ArcGIS Online or Portal.

    ranges to your layers. This will control when they become visible based on the

    is to limit how much data can be drawn at any given time. The scale ranges that
