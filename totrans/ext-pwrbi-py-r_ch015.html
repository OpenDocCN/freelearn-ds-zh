<h1 data-number="15">14 Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<p>In <em>Chapter 13</em>, <em>Using Machine Learning without Premium or Embedded Capacity</em>, we mentioned that using <strong>Auto Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>AutoML</strong>) solutions on a dataset blindly often does not lead to very accurate models. This is because it is necessary to understand the most inherent characteristics of the dataset by using statistical tools at an earlier stage to extract useful information in order to get a better model.</p>
<p>The approach to be used for this type of dataset analysis is called <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> (<strong>EDA</strong>) and was first introduced by John Turkey to encourage statisticians to explore data and formulate hypotheses that would lead to new data collection and experiments to eventually enrich patterns among the variables in a dataset.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the goal of EDA?</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and R</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis in Power BI</li>
</ul>
<section id="technical-requirements-13" class="level2" data-number="15.1">
<h2 data-number="15.1">Technical requirements</h2>
<p>This chapter requires you to have a working internet connection and <strong>Power BI Desktop</strong> already installed on your machine. You must have properly configured the R and Python engines and IDEs as outlined in <em>Chapter 2</em>, <em>Configuring R with Power BI</em>, and <em>Chapter 3</em>, <em>Configuring Python with Power BI</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-the-goal-of-eda" class="level2" data-number="15.2">
<h2 data-number="15.2">What is the goal of EDA?</h2>
<p>The objective of EDA is to make sure that the dataset to be used later for more complex processes is first of all clean, that is, it has no missing values and no outliers that could divert possible subsequent analyses. In addition, it is important to select during this phase the variables that actually bring information, trying to drop those that determine mostly noise. This eliminates possible sources of inaccuracy in the conclusions to which subsequent processes lead. At this stage, it is also important to study the associations between variables and gain insights from the data analyzed in order to justify any more complex processing to be applied later.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the phases of EDA are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding your data</li>
<li>Cleaning your data</li>
<li>Discovering associations between variables</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look in detail at what types of analysis they involve.</p>
<section id="understanding-your-data" class="level3" data-number="15.2.1">
<h3 data-number="15.2.1">Understanding your data</h3>
<p>In this first phase, it is essential to understand the meaning that each variable takes on in the context of the problem that the dataset represents. Once the measurable business entities with which the variables are associated are clear, it is easier to draw conclusions about how they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Having an idea of <strong>the size of the dataset</strong>, understood as the number of variables and the number of observations (rows), helps you get a first idea of the size of the data you will be dealing with. After that, identifying and immediately defining the <strong>type of variables</strong> involved (which can be numerical or categorical) is of crucial importance in order to visualize them in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p>Then, knowing the <strong>descriptive statistics</strong> of the <strong>numerical variables</strong> in the dataset helps to have greater sensitivity about their values. For each numeric variable, you can represent its histogram by highlighting its skewness and boxplot to better analyze its distribution, as you have already studied in <em>Chapter 11</em>, <em>Adding Statistics Insights: Associations</em>.</p>
<p>For <strong>categorical variables</strong>, on the other hand, it is important to know the number of distinct categories and which characteristics of the observations they identify. It is possible to represent each unique category with its frequency and relative percentage of the total in a <strong>bar chart</strong>. Here is an example considering the Titanic disaster dataset:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file368.png" alt="Figure 14.1 – Bar chart of Pclass" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.1 – Bar chart of Pclass</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is important to check whether more than one category has a very low frequency because it might make sense to aggregate them into a single category. This is usually done in a subsequent phase of a machine learning project (called <strong>Feature Engineering</strong>) in order to avoid, for example, having a model that is not generic enough for all the cases for which it must be adopted (the phenomenon of <strong>overfitting</strong>) and therefore determining bad performance.</p>
<p>It is also very important to give the analyst the possibility of graphically representing a pair of variables in order to understand how they interact with each other (<strong>multivariate analysis</strong> of the dataset). The type of visualization obviously changes according to the data type of the variables involved: in the case of two numeric variables, you will have a scatter plot; in the case of two categorical variables, you will have a mosaic plot; in the case of one numeric and one categorical variable, you will have several boxplots (or raincloud plots) for each category.</p>
<p>At this point, we can move on to describing the phase that deals with data cleaning.</p>
</section>
<section id="cleaning-your-data" class="level3" data-number="15.2.2">
<h3 data-number="15.2.2">Cleaning your data</h3>
<p>As you learned in <em>Chapter 12</em>, <em>Adding Statistics Insights: Outliers and Missing Values</em>, the most important activities to obtain a statistically robust dataset that is as close as possible to the real case it represents are these two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining <strong>outliers</strong> and managing them</li>
<li>Imputing <strong>missing values</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the EDA process, it is important to make use of all visual and non-visual tools useful to detect outliers and missing values in a straightforward way. This will allow any anomalies found to be fixed at a later stage.</p>
<p>As you have learned previously, for <strong>univariate outlier analysis</strong> it is very useful to represent individual distributions using boxplots for numeric variables. And it would also be very useful to be able to see what outliers remain or are added after transforming the variable via Yeo-Johnson transformations. That way you can see if it might be worth trying to normalize the distribution to deal with as few outliers as possible.</p>
<p>It is also convenient to be able to do a <strong>bivariate analysis of the outliers</strong> considering a numerical variable and a categorical one so that you study the anomalies of the distribution of the numerical variable broken down by each label of the categorical one.</p>
<p>After carefully studying and identifying possible outliers, it is also important to have a convenient visualization of combinations and intersections of <strong>missing values</strong> between variables. The goal is therefore to know not only the count and relative percentage value of the missing values of each variable, but also to have a convenient visualization of how these missing values interact with each other thanks to an upset plot.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s turn to the analysis of associations between variables.</p>
</section>
<section id="discovering-associations-between-variables" class="level3" data-number="15.2.3">
<h3 data-number="15.2.3">Discovering associations between variables</h3>
<p>As you learned in <em>Chapter 11</em>, <em>Adding Statistics Insights: Associations</em>, knowing the <strong>degree of association between variables</strong> in the dataset certainly helps you understand which ones carry the most information and which ones generate mostly just noise. Selecting the most informative variables and using them for training a machine learning model certainly helps you to get more stable and performant results.</p>
<p>Having visual tools to interpret the associations between pairs of numeric-numeric, numeric-categorical, and categorical-categorical variables certainly helps in the hard task of feature selection.</p>
<p>There are tools that allow you to generate EDA reports automatically. Let's see what they are.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="exploratory-data-analysis-with-python-and-r" class="level2" data-number="15.3">
<h2 data-number="15.3">Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and R</h2>
<p>If you have to do data exploration using only Python or R, there are tools that automatically generate a series of visuals that make your life easier. We have two lists below, one for Python tools, the other for R tools, in case you need any. It is easier to find tools for interactive data analysis in Python than in R. Packages available in R often provide wrappers that greatly simplify EDA via coding.</p>
<p>The Python libraries for EDA are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SweetVIZ</strong> (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/">https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/</a>): An open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA with just two lines of code.</li>
<li><strong>Lux</strong> (<a href="https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/">https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/</a>): A Python library that facilitates fast and easy data exploration by automating the visualization and data analysis process.</li>
<li><strong>Pandas Profiling</strong> (<a href="https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/">https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/</a>): Generates profile reports from a pandas dataframe for data analysis.</li>
<li><strong>PandasGUI</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/adamerose/pandasgui">https://github.com/adamerose/pandasgui</a>): A GUI for viewing, plotting, and analyzing pandas dataframes.</li>
<li><strong>D-Tale</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/man-group/dtale">https://github.com/man-group/dtale</a>): The combination of a Flask backend and a React frontend to bring you an easy way to view and analyze pandas data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The R packages for EDA are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ExPanDaR</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/joachim-gassen/ExPanDaR">https://github.com/joachim-gassen/ExPanDaR</a>): ExPanD is a Shiny-based app supporting interactive exploratory data analysis.</li>

<li><strong>summarytools</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools">https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools</a>): An R package for data cleaning, exploring, and simple reporting. It integrates well with commonly used software and tools for reporting in R (such as RStudio).</li>
<li><strong>DataExplorer</strong> (<a href="https://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/">https://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/</a>): Aims to automate most data handling and visualization so that users can focus on studying the data and extracting insights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at the references for further details about the aforementioned tools.</p>
<p>If you want to take advantage of Power BI as a visualization tool, you unfortunately cannot use many of the visualizations automatically generated by the aforementioned Python tools. Therefore, we will use R packages to generate the necessary for basic EDA via code because R allows you to obtain very high-quality graphics of any complexity quite easily. Let's see how.</p>
</section>
<section id="exploratory-data-analysis-in-power-bi" class="level2" data-number="15.4">
<h2 data-number="15.4">Exploratory data analysis in Power BI</h2>
<p>In this section, we will make extensive use of the <code>GGplot2</code> package, an advanced R library designed for creating plots based on <strong>The Grammar of Graphics</strong>. It is not our intention to go into detail about every feature exposed by the package, even if it is used quite widely in the code that accompanies the chapter. Our goal is, as always, to provide code that is easy to customize for use in other projects, and above all, to provide a starting point for a more detailed look at the functions used. For more details, take a look at the references of this chapter.</p>
<p>In addition to the tools that Tidyverse provides in R (including <code>ggplot2</code>), we will also use the <code>summarytools</code> and <code>DataExplorer</code> packages to create EDA reports in Power BI. It is therefore necessary to install them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open RStudio and make sure it is referencing your latest CRAN R (version 4.0.2 in our case).</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Console</strong> window and enter this command: <code>install.packages('Rcpp')</code>. It’s a <code>summarytools</code> dependency. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('summarytools')</code>. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('DataExplorer')</code>. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, we can start implementing our EDA reports. First, however, it is important to highlight the fact that the data type of variables must be defined in each R script you will use in your report.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of EDA, it is important to define the data type of variables in the dataset to be analyzed. Depending on the data types of the features, different analysis strategies are applied. The data types of columns of a Power BI table in the data model are not mappable one-to-one with the data types handled by R. Therefore, it is necessary to define the data types of the columns directly in an R script to prevent Power BI from overwriting them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the <code>00-init-dataset.R</code> script that you will find in the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder will be used as the <em>official CSV connector</em> of your EDA report in Power BI as in this case it is more convenient to load data directly into R for each script in which it is used. After loading your data in it, you need to define the columns to drop, the categorical and integer ones. Columns specified as integers will be viewed as either numeric or categorical variables, leaving the analyst to select them according to the function that best describes the phenomenon under analysis. All the other columns are supposed to be numeric:</p>
<pre><code>library(readr)
library(dplyr)
dataset_url &lt;- &#39;http://bit.ly/titanic-dataset-csv&#39;
src_tbl &lt;- read_csv(dataset_url)
vars_to_drop &lt;- c(&#39;PassengerId&#39;)
categorical_vars &lt;- c(&#39;Sex&#39;, &#39;Ticket&#39;, &#39;Cabin&#39;, &#39;Embarked&#39;)
integer_vars &lt;- c(&#39;Survived&#39;, &#39;Pclass&#39;, &#39;SibSp&#39;, &#39;Parch&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>If you need to import an Excel file instead of a CSV file, you already know how to implement changes to the code because of what you learned in <em>Chapter 7</em>, <em>Logging Data from Power BI to External Sources</em>.</p>
<p>Then the script will define the <code>tbl</code> tibble applying the appropriate transformations:</p>
<pre><code>tbl &lt;- src_tbl %&gt;% 
  mutate( 
    across(categorical_vars, as.factor),
    across(integer_vars, as.integer)
  ) %&gt;% 
  select( -all_of(vars_to_drop) )</code></pre>
<p>This script will be pre-loaded into every other R script you develop for the EDA report so that you are sure to have the dataset with the precise data types specified ready in memory.</p>
<p>So, let's start developing the report from the basic statistics of the dataset.</p>
<section id="dataset-summary-page" class="level3" data-number="15.4.1">
<h3 data-number="15.4.1">Dataset summary page</h3>
<p>The first page of the EDA report is responsible for providing the analyst with an overview of the data contained in the dataset. Some <strong>basic information</strong> will be exposed enriching the output of the function <code>introduce()</code> of the <code>DataExplorer</code> package. This information is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of rows and columns</li>
<li>Number of discrete (categorical) and continuous (numeric) columns</li>
<li>Number of columns having all missing values</li>
<li>Total number of missing values in the dataset</li>
<li>Number of complete rows, that is, not having missing values</li>
<li>Total number of observations in the dataset, given by the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns</li>
<li>Memory used in KB</li>
<li>Number of duplicated rows</li>
</ul>
<p>Then a <strong>summary statistics table</strong> for the entire dataset is calculated starting from the output of the <code>dfSummary()</code> function of the <code>summarytools</code> package. The information it contains for each variable is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable name and data type</li>
<li>Basic statistics according to the data type</li>
<li>Number of unique valid values (not null)</li>
<li>Frequencies of valid values</li>
<li>Number of valid values and their percentage</li>
<li>Number of missing values and their percentage</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, more extensive <strong>descriptive statistics</strong> are provided for numerical variables thanks to the <code>descr()</code> function of the <code>summarytools</code> package. In addition to the most common ones, the following statistics are added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Median Absolute Deviation</strong> (<em>mad</em>): Contrary to the variance and standard deviation, it is a robust measure of outliers of how widespread a dataset is. It is usually used for non-normal distributions.</li>
<li><strong>Interquartile range</strong> (<em>iqr</em>): As you already saw for the boxplots, it is a measure of where the bulk of the distribution values lie.</li>
<li><strong>Coefficient of variation</strong> (<em>cv</em>): It is a measure of relative variability as it is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.</li>
<li><strong>Coefficient of skewness</strong> (<em>skewness</em>): It is a measure of the lack of distribution symmetry.</li>
<li><strong>Kurtosis</strong> (<em>kurtosis</em>): It is a measure of whether the data is heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this information, the analyst can get a complete picture of the shape of the data contained in the dataset.</p>
<p>Let's see how to implement them in Power BI. First, make sure that Power BI Desktop references the correct versions of R in <strong>Options</strong>. Then follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Get Data</strong>, search for <code>script</code>, select <strong>R script</strong>, and click on <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the script you can find in the file <code>01-basic-info.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder. Make sure that the <code>init_path</code> variable points to the correct absolute path of the <code>00-init-dataset.R</code> file you can find in the same folder.</li>
<li>In the navigator dialog, select the <code>basic_info_tbl</code>, the <code>numeric_vars_descr_stats_tbl</code>, the <code>summary_tbl</code>, and the <code>sample_tbl</code> tables. Then click on <strong>Load</strong>.</li>
<li><p>After the four tables are loaded in the <strong>Fields</strong> panel on the right in Power BI Desktop, you can add them into your report canvas simply by checking their measures. For example, expand the <code>basic_info_tbl</code> content and check the fields <code>attribute</code> (string field) and <code>value</code> (numeric field) in this order to get a table chart (if you click on the numeric field first, you’ll get a column chart). A table will appear on your canvas:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file369.png" alt="Figure 14.2 – Basic info table in its first state" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.2 – Basic info table in its first state</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this case, the <strong>Total</strong> row makes no sense. Therefore, it must be eliminated working on the <strong>Format</strong> properties of the visual.</p></li>
<li>Make sure that the table visual is selected and then click on the <strong>Format</strong> options (the wall brush icon) on the <strong>Visualizations</strong> panel on the right. Expand the <strong>Total</strong> section and switch off the <strong>Total</strong> option. Then expand the <strong>Field formatting</strong> section, select the <code>value</code> field from the combo box, and enter <code>0</code> into the <strong>Value decimal places</strong> textbox. Finally, switch on the <strong>Title</strong> option and expand its options. Then enter the label <code>Basic Dataset Info</code> in the textbox.</li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot on the canvas, expand the <code>summary_tbl</code> fields and check them in the following order: <strong>Variable</strong>, <strong>Stats Values</strong>, <strong>Unique Valid</strong>, <strong>Freq of Valid</strong>, <strong>Valid</strong>, and <strong>Missing</strong>. After that, expand the right edge of the visual in order to see all the columns.</li>
<li>As done in <em>Step 5</em> for the <code>basic_info_tbl</code> table, remove the <strong>Total</strong> row also for this table and use this string as the label: <code>Dataset Summary</code>.</li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot on the canvas, expand the <code>numeric_vars_descr_stats_tbl</code> fields, and check them in the following order: <strong>variable</strong>, <strong>mean</strong>, <strong>sd</strong>, <strong>min</strong>, <strong>q1</strong>, <strong>med</strong>, <strong>q3</strong>, <strong>max</strong>, <strong>mad</strong>, <strong>iqr</strong>, <strong>cv</strong>, <strong>skewness</strong>, and <strong>kurtosis</strong>. After that, expand the right edge of the visual in order to see all the columns.</li>
<li>For this table, also remove the <strong>Total</strong> row and use this string as the label: <code>Descriptive Statistics for Numeric Variables</code>.</li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot on the canvas, expand the <code>sample_tbl</code> fields, and check them all in the order you want after checking <strong>Name</strong> first (checking a non-numeric field at the beginning, the visual selected by default will be the table).</li>
<li>For this table, also remove the <strong>Total</strong> row and use this string as the label: <code>Dataset Sample</code>.</li>
<li><p>After repositioning the visuals on the canvas and expanding the individual table columns a bit, you'll get your first EDA report page, like the following:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file370.png" alt="Figure 14.3 – Summary page of the EDA report" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.3 – Summary page of the EDA report</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>Just rename the page (right-click on the bottom page tab and click <strong>Rename Page</strong>) using the label <code>Summary</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep the following in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong></p>
<p>In order to display the sample details of the dataset, you must properly select its fields in Power BI Desktop. This means that if you want to change the source dataset, you must edit the sample details visual by hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice work! You just developed the first page of your EDA report.</p>
<p>Let’s now try to develop a page dedicated to the analysis of missing values.</p>
</section>
<section id="missing-values-exploration" class="level3" data-number="15.4.2">
<h3 data-number="15.4.2">Missing values exploration</h3>
<p>Although some information about the missing values is present in text format on the newly developed <strong>Summary</strong> page, providing a page containing visuals dedicated to the missing values is definitely an advantage for the analyst.</p>
<p>In addition to displaying a simple <strong>lollipop plot</strong> indicating the percentage values of missing values for each variable, you will also use an <strong>upset plot</strong> to allow the analyst to figure out which combinations of variables are found to be missing altogether, just as you learned in <em>Chapter 12</em>, <em>Adding Statistics Insights: Outliers and Missing Values</em>.</p>
<p>So, let’s start to develop the <strong>Associations</strong> page:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it does not already exist, create a new Power BI report page by clicking on the plus icon near the tabs at the bottom of the canvas. A new tab named <strong>Page 1</strong> will be created.</li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the <strong>R Visual</strong> icon in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane and enable it when you’re prompted to do so. After that, move it to the left of the page and resize it in order to fill half of it.</li>
<li>Keeping it selected, click on the <code>attribute</code> field of the <code>basic_info_tbl</code> table. You won't use this field in the R Visual code, but you must select at least one measure to enable the script in the visual.</li>
<li>Now click on the R Visual’s <strong>Format</strong> tab and under the <strong>Title</strong> section, enter the string <code>Missing Value Percentages</code> as the title.</li>
<li>Copy the code of the file <code>02-missing-values-plot-1.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder and paste it into the R Visual script editor. Then click on the <strong>Run script</strong> arrow icon at the top right of the R script editor (enable the R Visual every time it’s requested). You’ll get the lollipop plot in it.</li>
<li>Click again on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the <strong>R Visual</strong> icon in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane, and enable it when you’re prompted to do so. After that, move it to the right of the page and resize it in order to fill half of it.</li>
<li>Keeping it selected, click on the <code>attribute</code> field of the <code>basic_info_tbl</code> table. You won't use this field in the R Visual code, but you must select at least one measure to enable the script in the visual.</li>
<li>Now click on the R Visual’s <strong>Format</strong> tab and under the <strong>Title</strong> section, enter the string <code>Variables Missing Together</code> as the title.</li>
<li>Copy the code of the file <code>03-missing-values-plot-2.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder and paste it into the R Visual script editor. Then click on the <strong>Run script</strong> arrow icon at the top right of the R script editor (enable the R Visual every time it’s requested). You’ll get the upset plot in it.</li>
<li>Just rename the current page (right-click on the tab at the bottom of the page and click <strong>Rename Page</strong>) using the label <code>Missing Values Analysis</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice one! It is now much easier for the analyst to understand the impact of missing values on the dataset. The whole page will be like the following one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file371.png" alt="Figure 14.4 – Missing values analysis page of the EDA report" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.4 – Missing values analysis page of the EDA report</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s now turn to developing a page dedicated to univariate analysis of the dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="univariate-exploration" class="level3" data-number="15.4.3">
<h3 data-number="15.4.3">Univariate exploration</h3>
<p>The one-dimensional analysis of a dataset consists of the analysis of the distributions of the variables that compose it. Depending on the data type of the variables, the visual tools used to facilitate this analysis are different.</p>
<p>For the analysis of numerical variables, a couple of graphs are used to better delineate their distribution: there is a <strong>histogram and density plot</strong> overlapping in the first graph, while in the second graph there is a <strong>raincloud plot</strong> (the set of a density plot and a boxplot). In <em>Figure 14.5</em>, you can find an example of the graphs for a numeric variable:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file372.png" alt="Figure 14.5 – Histogram and density plot of Age" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.5 – Histogram and density plot of Age</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For categorical variables, a simple <strong>bar chart</strong> is used, with the intention of limiting the maximum number of distinct categories to be displayed so that they don’t exceed a predefined number, and grouping the other categories in the dummy <strong>others</strong> category:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file373.png" alt="Figure 14.6 – Bar chart of the Cabin variable" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.6 – Bar chart of the Cabin variable</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The selection of variables to be displayed in Power BI is done through drop-down slicers. If a variable is of the integer type, it appears both in the dropdown of the numerical variables and in that of the categorical variables, so the analyst can visualize them in the way that they consider more appropriate.</p>
<p>Since the graphs will need to be displayed via R Visuals, should you wish to publish the EDA report to the Power BI service, you must ensure that the R packages to be used are compatible with the version of the R engine found on the Power BI service. Remember also that Power BI Desktop can reference only one R engine at a time, which will be the one used for both Power Query and R Visuals on your machine. So, if you plan to use the latest R engine for Power Query once the report is published, you should also install the packages needed to render the report on this engine in your machine. This way you ensure that the report is rendered correctly on Power BI Desktop as well during your tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open RStudio and make sure it is referencing your CRAN R dedicated to R Visuals (version 3.4.4 in our case).</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Console</strong> window and enter this command: <code>install.packages('cowplot')</code>. It’s like an extension of <code>ggplot2</code>, providing themes and functions to align, arrange, and annotate plots. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('ggpubr')</code>. It provides some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing <code>ggplot2</code> based publication-ready plots. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('ggExtra')</code>. It is a collection of functions and layers to enhance <code>ggplot2</code>, mostly used for its <code>ggMarginal</code> function, which adds marginal histograms/boxplots/density plots to scatterplots. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('RColorBrewer')</code>. It is an essential tool to manage colors and palettes with R. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('ggmosaic')</code>. It is designed to create visualizations of categorical data, in particular mosaic plots. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>install.packages('</code> <code>ggdist')</code>. It is designed to create visualizations of categorical data, in particular mosaic plots. Then, press <em>Enter</em>.</li>
<li>Change the RStudio R reference to your CRAN R dedicated to Power Query (version 4.0.2 in our case) and restart RStudio.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 to 7.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can start developing the new page of your report dedicated to the univariate analysis of the dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it does not already exist, create a new Power BI report page by clicking on the plus icon near the tabs at the bottom of the canvas. A new tab named <strong>Page 1</strong> will be created.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Get Data</strong>, search for <code>script</code>, select <strong>R script</strong>, and click on <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the script you can find in the file <code>04-serialize-univariate-plots.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder. Make sure that the <code>folder</code> variable points to the correct absolute path of the <code>Chapter14</code> folder.</li>
<li>In the navigator dialog, select the <code>basic_info_tbl</code>, the <code>numeric_vars_descr_stats_tbl</code>, the <code>summary_tbl</code>, and the <code>sample_tbl</code> tables. Then click on <strong>Load</strong>.</li>
<li>This script serializes to disk the lists with the graphs associated with each variable according to their type. Once you click <strong>OK</strong>, you will find the following files on disk: <code>histodensity_lst.rds</code>, <code>histodensity_transf_lst.rds</code> (numerical variables transformed according to Yeo-Johnson), and <code>barchart_lst.rds</code>. Pre-computing lists of graphs and serializing them to disk is a good strategy when the possible combinations of the variables involved are low.</li>
<li><p>In the Navigator dialog, select the <code>categorical_df</code> and <code>numeric_df</code> tables. As you can see, the <code>numeric_df</code> table contains the names of the numeric variables in the <code>numeric_col_name</code> column repeated twice, once for each type of transformation in the <code>transf_type</code> column to be applied to them (<code>standard</code> and <code>yeo-johnson</code>):</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file374.png" alt="Figure 14.7 – numeric_df table’s content" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.7 – numeric_df table’s content</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then click on <strong>Load</strong>.</p></li>
<li>Click on the slicer visual icon. Then expand the <code>numeric_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>numeric_col_name</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, switch off the <strong>Slicer header</strong> one, and add the <strong>Title</strong> <code>Numeric Variables</code>.</li>
<li>Click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the slicer visual icon. Then expand the <code>numeric_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>transf_type</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, switch off the <strong>Slicer header</strong> one, and add the <strong>Title</strong> <code>Transformations</code>.</li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the <strong>R Visual</strong> icon in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane and enable it when you’re prompted to do so. After that, move it under the two slicers you’ve just created.</li>
<li>Keeping it selected, click on both fields of the <strong>numeric_df</strong> table (<strong>numeric_col_name</strong> and <strong>transf_type</strong>).</li>
<li>Now click on the R Visual’s <strong>Format</strong> tab and switch off the <strong>Title</strong> option.</li>
<li><p>Copy the code of the file <code>05-plot-numeric-variables.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder and paste it into the R Visual script editor. Then click on the <strong>Run script</strong> arrow icon at the top right of the R script editor (enable the R Visual every time it’s requested). You’ll get the univariate analysis of the not transformed <code>Age</code> variable:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file375.png" alt="Figure 14.9 – Univariate analysis of the Age variable" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.9 – Univariate analysis of the Age variable</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>If you select the <code>yeo-johnson</code> transformation from the <strong>Transformations</strong> dropdown, the plots will update accordingly:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file376.png" alt="Figure 14.10 – Univariate analysis of the Yeo-Johnson transformed Age variable" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.10 – Univariate analysis of the Yeo-Johnson transformed Age variable</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>Let’s now create the slicer of categorical variables. Click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the slicer visual icon. Then expand the <code>categorical_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>categorical_col_name</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, switch off the <strong>Slicer header</strong> one, and add the <strong>Title</strong> <code>Categorical Variables</code>.</li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the <strong>R Visual</strong> icon in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane and enable it when you’re prompted to do so. After that, move it under the slicer you’ve just created.</li>
<li>Keeping it selected, click on the field of the <strong>categorical_df</strong> table (<strong>categorical_col_name</strong>).</li>
<li>Now click on the R Visual’s <strong>Format</strong> tab and switch off the <strong>Title</strong> option.</li>
<li><p>Copy the code of the file <code>06-plot-categorical-variables.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder and paste it into the R Visual script editor. Then click on the <strong>Run script</strong> arrow icon at the top-right of the R script editor (enable the R Visual every time it’s requested). You’ll get the univariate analysis of the <code>Cabin</code> variable:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file377.png" alt="Figure 14.11 – Univariate analysis of the Cabin variable" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.11 – Univariate analysis of the Cabin variable</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>Just rename the current page (right-click on the tab at the bottom of the page and click <strong>Rename Page</strong>) using the label <code>Univariate Analysis</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice one! You just developed a great EDA report page dedicated to univariate dataset analysis. Playing with the slicers, the whole page will be like the following one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file378.png" alt="Figure 14.12 – The Univariate Analysis EDA report’s page" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.12 – The Univariate Analysis EDA report’s page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is now time to develop a page of the report dedicated to multivariate analysis of the dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="multivariate-exploration" class="level3" data-number="15.4.4">
<h3 data-number="15.4.4">Multivariate exploration</h3>
<p>In general, the analysis of variables taken individually is never sufficient to give the analyst a complete overview of the dataset. Being able to use visuals that allow the interaction of multiple variables depending on their data type is definitely a step towards more accurate analysis of the dataset.</p>
<p>The most common visual used for analyzing the interaction of two numerical variables is the <strong>scatterplot</strong>. In our case, we will use an enriched version of this plot, adding the <strong>marginal distributions</strong> of the variables at the edges. Moreover, it’s possible to color the points according to another categorical variable. In this way, the analyst can study the interaction of three variables. In <em>Figure 14.13</em>, you can find an example of this plot for the variables <code>Age</code> and <code>Fare</code> grouped by the <code>Sex</code> one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file379.png" alt="Figure 14.13 – Scatterplot with marginal histograms for Age and Fare by Sex" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.13 – Scatterplot with marginal histograms for Age and Fare by Sex</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, there are as many regression lines as there are categories of the grouping variable. In the event  of a missing grouping variable, the regression line is unique and in that case, the plot also shows the values of Pearson's R coefficient, Spearman's <strong>rho</strong>, and Kendall's <strong>tau</strong>, with the p-value derived from the respective tests. In short, in this case, the <strong>p-value</strong> represents the probability that the correlation between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the sample data occurred by chance (take a look at the references to learn more about p-values):</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file380.png" alt="Figure 14.14 – Scatterplot for Age and Fare (transformed) without grouping" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.14 – Scatterplot for Age and Fare (transformed) without grouping</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the variables to study the interaction of are categorical, the <strong>mosaic plot</strong> comes to your aid. In <em>Figure 14.15</em>, you can find the mosaic plot of the <code>SibSp</code> and <code>Pclass</code> variables grouped by the <code>Sex</code> one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file381.png" alt="Figure 14.15 – Mosaic plot for Pclass and SibSp grouped by Sex" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.15 – Mosaic plot for Pclass and SibSp grouped by Sex</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally, it is possible to study the interaction of a numerical variable with a categorical one by visualizing <strong>raincloud plots for each category</strong>. In addition, it is always possible to split the plot by a third categorical variable, as in the previous cases. In <em>Figure 14.16</em>, you can see an example of this plot for the variables <code>Fare</code> (transformed by Yeo-Johnson for a better visualization) and <code>Pclass</code> by the <code>Sex</code> one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file382.png" alt="Figure 14.16 – Raincloud plots for the variables Fare and Pcalss grouped by Sex" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.16 – Raincloud plots for the variables Fare and Pcalss grouped by Sex</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now you can start developing the new page of your report dedicated to the univariate analysis of the dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it does not already exist, create a new Power BI report page clicking on the plus icon near the tabs at the bottom of the canvas. A new tab named <strong>Page 1</strong> will be created.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Get Data</strong>, search for <code>script</code>, select <strong>R script</strong>, and click on <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the script you can find in the file <code>07-create-multivariate-objects.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder. Make sure that the <code>folder</code> variable points to the correct absolute path of the <code>Chapter14</code> folder.</li>
<li><p>In the navigator dialog, select the <code>multivariate_df</code> table. This time, the code to generate the plots will be written directly in the R Visual, without the need to serialize them first and recall them at the time of visualization. This strategy is opposite to the one used for the page of the univariate analysis because, in this case, the number of combinations between the variables in the game is much higher, and to generate the same number of plots in a list and to serialize everything is not very efficient. The <code>multivariate_df</code> table is a dataframe that is the result of a cross join between all the variables involved in the multivariate analysis (two numerical variables, a variable associated with the type of transformation for each of them, two categorical variables, and another categorical one for the grouping: seven variables in total):</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file383.png" alt="Figure 14.17 – multivariate_df table’s content" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.17 – multivariate_df table’s content</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then click on <strong>Load</strong>.</p></li>
<li>Click on the slicer visual icon. Then expand the <code>multivariate_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>x</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, enter the <code>x numeric</code> title under the <strong>Slicer header</strong> section, switch on the <strong>Title</strong> section, and add the <code>Analysis Variables</code> title.</li>
<li>Click on an empty spot in the report canvas first and then on the slicer visual icon. Expand the <code>multivariate_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel, and check the <code>x_transf_type</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, enter the <code>x transformation</code> title under the <strong>Slicer header</strong> section, and keep the <strong>Title</strong> section switched off.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5 to 10 in order to create the <strong>y numeric</strong> and <strong>y transformation</strong> slicers, making sure to select the <code>y</code> and <code>y_transf_type</code> measures respectively. Keep the <strong>Title</strong> section switched off for them also.</li>
<li>Click on an empty spot in the report canvas first and then on the slicer visual icon. Expand the <code>multivariate_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel, and check the <code>cat1</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, enter the <code>cat1 categorical</code> title under the <strong>Slicer header</strong> section and keep the <strong>Title</strong> section switched off.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 12 to 14 in order to create the <strong>cat2 categorical</strong> slicer. Make sure to select the <code>cat2</code> measure for it.</li>
<li>Click on an empty spot in the report canvas first and then on the slicer visual icon. Expand the <code>multivariate_df</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>grp</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, enter the <code>grp categorical</code> title under the <strong>Slicer header</strong> section, and keep the <strong>Title</strong> section switched off.</li>
<li><p>Try to align all these sliders on a single row on top of your page like the following:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file384.png" alt="Figure 14.18 – Multivariate page’s slicers on top of the page" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.18 – Multivariate page’s slicers on top of the page</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the <strong>R Visual</strong> icon in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane and enable it when you’re prompted to do so. After that, move it under the row of slicers you’ve just created and resize it in order to fill the page.</li>
<li>Keeping it selected, click on all the fields of the <code>multivariate_df</code> table.</li>
<li>Now click on the R Visual’s <strong>Format</strong> tab and switch off the <strong>Title</strong> option.</li>
<li>Copy the code of the file <code>08-plot-multivariate-plots.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder and paste it into the R Visual script editor. Then click on the <strong>Run script</strong> arrow icon at the top right of the R script editor (enable the R Visual every time it’s requested). You’ll get all the multivariate analysis plots in it.</li>
<li>Just rename the current page (right-click on the tab at the bottom of the page and click <strong>Rename Page</strong>) using the label <code>Multivariate Analysis</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Amazing! This EDA report page dedicated to multivariate analysis is very revealing for an analyst. Playing with the slicers, the whole page will be like the following one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file385.png" alt="Figure 14.19 – Multivariate analysis page of the EDA report" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.19 – Multivariate analysis page of the EDA report</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Keep in mind that the numeric <code>y</code> variable is used for both the scatterplot and the raincloud plot as the <em>y</em> axis. The categorical <code>cat1</code> variable is used as the <em>x</em> axis for both the raincloud plot and the mosaic plot. The categorical <code>grp</code> variable is used to group all three plots by their labels.</p>
<p>You've just had a demonstration of how powerful and flexible R is for professional graphics development. Let’s see how to develop a page for variable associations.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-associations" class="level3" data-number="15.4.5">
<h3 data-number="15.4.5">Variable associations</h3>
<p>As you learned from <em>Chapter 11</em>, <em>Adding Statistics Insights: Associations</em>, knowing the correlation coefficient that binds two variables gives you the opportunity to assess the predictive power of one variable toward the other. From the same chapter, you also learned how to calculate the correlation coefficient depending on combinations of the different types of variables involved.</p>
<p>In this section, we will put what you have learned to use in developing a page for the EDA report containing a <strong>heatmap plot</strong> colored according to the intensity of the correlation coefficient. Here is an example:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file386.png" alt="Figure 14.20 – Correlation heatmap of the dataset" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.20 – Correlation heatmap of the dataset</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The correlation coefficient will be calculated according to the selection that the analyst can make thanks to two slicers: one that allows you to choose which method to use for the correlation between numerical variables, and another that allows you to choose the method to use for the correlation between categorical variables.</p>
<p>So, let’s start to develop the <strong>Associations</strong> page:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it does not already exist, create a new Power BI report page by clicking on the plus icon near the tabs at the bottom of the canvas. A new tab named <strong>Page 1</strong> will be created.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Get Data</strong>, search for <code>script</code>, select <strong>R script</strong>, and click on <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the script you can find in the file <code>09-create-association-objects.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder. Make sure that the <code>folder</code> variable points to the correct absolute path of the <code>Chapter14</code> folder.</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Navigator</strong> dialog, select the <code>corr_tbl</code> table. This table is given by the set of several transformations. First, for each combination of correlation methods (for numerical and categorical variables), a column containing the respective correlation coefficient was calculated. This was sped up by using the parallel computation for R introduced in <em>Chapter 9</em>, <em>Calling External APIs To Enrich Your Data</em>. After that, a pivot operation was performed, bringing all these columns into the single column <code>corr</code> and creating the new column <code>corr_type</code>, which contains the string identifying the combination of methods used. Finally, the <code>corr_type</code> column was split into two separate columns, one for use in the correlation method slicer for numerical variables, the other for use in the correlation method slicer for categorical variables. Here is a sample of the result table:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file387.png" alt="Figure 14.21 – corr_tbl table’s content" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.21 – corr_tbl table’s content</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then click on <strong>Load</strong>.</p></li>
<li>Click on the slicer visual icon. Then expand the <code>corr_tbl</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>numeric_corr_type</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, enter the <code>Numeric correlation type</code> title under the <strong>Slicer header</strong> section, switch on the <strong>Title</strong> section, and add the <code>Analysis Variables</code> title.</li>
<li>Click on an empty spot in the report canvas first and then on the slicer visual icon. Expand the <code>corr_tbl</code> table under the <strong>Fields</strong> panel and check the <code>categorical_corr_type</code> measure.</li>
<li>Click on the downward-pointing arrow at the top right of the slicer to select the <strong>Dropdown</strong> slicer type.</li>
<li>Resize the bottom edge of the slicer, click on its <strong>Format</strong> options, switch on the <strong>Single select</strong> one under <strong>Selection controls</strong>, enter the <code>Categorical correlation type</code> title under the <strong>Slicer header</strong> section and keep the <strong>Title</strong> section switched off.</li>
<li><p>Try to align all these sliders on a single row at the top of your page like the following:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file388.png" alt="Figure 14.22 – Association page’s slicers at the top of the page" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.22 – Association page’s slicers at the top of the page</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>Now click on an empty spot in the report canvas first. Then click on the <strong>R Visual</strong> icon in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane and enable it when you’re prompted to do so. After that, move it under the row of slicers you’ve just created and resize it in order to fill the page.</li>
<li>Keeping it selected, click on the <code>col</code>, <code>corr</code>, and <code>row</code> fields of the <code>corr_tbl</code> table.</li>
<li>Copy the code of the file <code>10-plot-association-plots.R</code> into the <code>Chapter14\R</code> folder and paste it into the R Visual script editor. Then click on the <strong>Run script</strong> arrow icon at the top right of the R script editor (enable the R Visual every time it’s requested). You’ll get all the multivariate analysis plots in it.</li>
<li>Now click on the R Visual’s <strong>Format</strong> tab and under the <strong>Title</strong> section, enter the string <code>Categorical Heatmap</code> as the title.</li>
<li>Just rename the current page (right-click on the tab at the bottom of the page and click <strong>Rename Page</strong>) using the label <code>Association Analysis</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's impressive how easy it was to create a correlation heatmap with R and <code>Ggplot</code>!</p>
<p>Playing with the slicers, the whole page will be like the following one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file389.png" alt="Figure 14.23 – Association analysis page of the EDA report" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 14.23 – Association analysis page of the EDA report</figcaption>
