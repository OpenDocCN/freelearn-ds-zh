<h1 id="_idParaDest-98" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor098" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Dynamic Social Networks</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In previous chapters, we’ve considered networks that don’t change over time. Their geometry remains unchanged, and spreading processes and importance metrics calculated on them don’t vary, either. However, this is not the case for many real-world networks, where new connections are forged and old connections break.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’ll consider networks that change over time and how these changes impact network structure and spreading processes. For instance, within a social network, users can join or deactivate accounts. The strength of their ties can change as they interact with other users’ content. All these actions drive network changes over time, which impact how processes such as information exchange across a network function as hubs appear and disappear or bridges forge across different hubs. We’ll consider simulation data and trial data collected from wildlife observations and hypothetical epidemics spreading across populations of crocodiles and blue herons, respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of this chapter, you’ll understand how networks change over time and what these impacts mean for spreading processes and network metrics. You’ll also know how to wrangle dynamic datasets into networks and analyze time slices. These methods scale to larger populations and longer time frames, so you’ll be equipped to work with population models at scale by the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Social networks that change over time</li>
<li class="calibre11">A deeper dive into spreading on networks</li>
<li class="calibre11">Example with evolving wildlife interaction datasets</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-99" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor099" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will be using a Jupyter notebook to run our dynamic network examples. You can also run this code on a cloud platform that supports Jupyter notebooks, such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>). We will be using a Jupyter notebook run on a laptop computer, and it is not necessary to have cloud access to process the examples in this chapter.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-100" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor100" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Social networks that change over time</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Consider your group of closest friends. How has that group changed over the last year? The last 5 years? The last 10?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Many social relationships and other types of data that can be represented using networks evolve over time. Friendships drift away and forge as people move, graduate from school, get married, change jobs, travel, or pass away. Animals migrate with changes in season, changes in climate, and human activity encroaching on grazing lands. Sales patterns across stores can be interrupted by new stores in the area, movements of population, and major world events such as COVID-19 or the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next sections, we’ll explore dynamic networks, whose structure changes over time. As network structure changes, so do many important properties related to information/disease flow and partitioning of the network.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-101" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor101" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Friendship networks</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Many social network platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker345" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> allow friendship groups to evolve and even encourage changes in structure. Consider sharing posts or tweets, tagging other people in your network post/tweet/picture who might have friends who have not met you yet, and adding searchable hashtags related to the content you are sharing. Each of these activities provides more visibility for you outside your initial social network, allowing friends of friends, acquaintances who haven’t connected with you on the social media platform, and individuals who share similar interests in your topic post to find you and connect.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s say someone posted a surreal dreamcatcher image on a social media platform (<em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.1</em>):</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.1 – A dreamcatcher image created with artificial intelligence (AI) posted to a social media platform" src="img/B21087_08_01.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1 – A dreamcatcher image created with artificial intelligence (AI) posted to a social media platform</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps the<a id="_idIndexMarker346" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> user added <code>#AIArt</code> and <code>#Dreamcatcher</code> and tagged a friend who posts similar content to <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.1</em>. Other platform users may search for others creating images with AI art platforms and want to follow the user or like/share the content. This provides more connections for the user and expands their network.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The friend who is tagged may benefit from these new connections, as the new connections for this user visit the friend’s page. Additionally, friends of that friend who haven’t encountered the user may also connect with the user or like/share their content. This also expands the user’s network.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Many social media platforms also connect users by creating interest pages or groups where users with similar interests can post content, connect, and discuss the topic. For instance, many social media platforms provide animal interest groups or pages with cute animal art or photographs, such as the animal art shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.2</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.2 – An AI art image of a baby elephant in a teacup surrounded by roses" src="img/B21087_08_02.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.2 – An AI art image of a baby elephant in a teacup surrounded by roses</p>
<p class="calibre3">These interest groups <a id="_idIndexMarker347" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>encourage connections between users and the sharing of searchable content to grow the group’s membership (sometimes encouraged by advertising optimization algorithms or other paid users, including groups themselves in some cases). Popular content tends to encourage group growth and interactions/connections between users in the group. Unpopular content tends to discourage growth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The darker side of algorithms that encourage connection generation between users with similar interests and optimize content spread is the potential for conspiracy theories and misinformation spread, as well as promoting connections between racist or discriminatory groups. During the 2016 and 2020 United States presidential elections (and during the COVID-19 pandemic), misinformation spread rapidly across social media platforms. During pandemics or national crises, misinformation can create public panic, increase strain on resources, or precipitate higher death rates. Within the political realm, misinformation can sway election results or accelerate divides between different political groups.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Algorithms that encourage the evolution of a social network to increase the number of likes by connecting people who probabilistically will like other users’ content or views of related advertisements can inadvertently do the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Promote the spread of misinformation among users likely to like or comment on it</li>
<li class="calibre11">Encourage connections between users sharing misinformation or harmful content</li>
<li class="calibre11">Create a feedback loop that perpetuates this problem on the social network</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">This can happen on<a id="_idIndexMarker348" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> social media platforms as well as community groups, internet chatrooms, and other forums. While promoting more cat memes may not be harmful (minus the potential for time wasted looking at cat memes), promoting racist ideologies or encouraging religious violence is quite harmful.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-102" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor102" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Triadic closure</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Most of the network evolution algorithm impacts result from a network property called <strong class="bold">triadic closure</strong>. Triadic closure<a id="_idIndexMarker349" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> on social networks roughly relies on the premise that friends of a user’s friends in a network might know the user in real life but not be connected yet. This is a direct connection-based instance of triadic closure in social networks. Another user who shares a friend group with many of our user’s friends likely knows that user (or would be a good connection for the user based on the shared social network). In addition, other users might share many interests with the user (the premise of many friend suggestion algorithms); this is a metadata-based instance of triadic closure, where connection formation hinges on similarity of user metadata rather than shared connections.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Consider Pieter, Kwame, and Pablo. All three enjoy football, software engineering, and hiking. Pablo and Pieter know each other, as do Pieter and Kwame; however, we don’t know if Kwame and Pablo know each other (<em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.3</em>):</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.3 – A diagram of the known relationships among our three football fans" src="img/B21087_08_03.jpg" class="calibre4"/>

</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.3 – A diagram of the known relationships among our three football fans</p>
<p class="calibre3">Given the two relationships <a id="_idIndexMarker350" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>that are known, along with the shared interest metadata, it is likely that Kwame and Pablo know each other, as well (or would get along if they connected). The percentage of open triads on a network measures the overall triadic openness of the network. Networks with a high percentage of open triads have a high potential for evolution over time as friends of friends or individuals with similar interests connect over shared content or group membership. Now that we know a bit more about relationships and how they can evolve over time, let’s dig deeper into spreading processes over evolving networks.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-103" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor103" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>A deeper dive into spreading on networks</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we understand a bit about how networks can change over time, let’s see how we can represent these networks in Python and compute spreading processes such as epidemic models over time on a dynamic network. Python provides several tools to help us both visualize and analyze dynamic networks as we have in prior chapters. Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-104" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor104" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Dynamic network introduction</h2>
<p class="calibre3">We can track changes over a<a id="_idIndexMarker351" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> network through time by keeping track of connections at different time points. Let’s consider a pride of lions in which individuals interact periodically over the course of the day. <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows this example network with timestamps to track edges:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.4 – An example of a dynamic network with timestamps" src="img/B21087_08_04.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.4 – An example of a dynamic network with timestamps</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows an example of a dynamic lion network with an evolving structure of edges and vertices that can be stamped with time information. Python provides a handy package to create a network such as this. The <code>NDlib</code> package utilizes <code>DyNetx</code> to model time-evolving graphs, which utilizes several key primitives from <code>DyNetx</code> to create and analyze dynamic networks. This provides a powerful framework for working with dynamic networks in the real world. This is particularly valuable in fields such as epidemiology, social network analysis, and transportation systems, where understanding temporal dynamics is essential. Let’s explore this package by creating <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.4</em> using <code>Script 8.1</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#create Figure 8.4
#import packages
#install dynetx if needed
#!pip install dynetx
import dynetx as dn
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#create an empty graph
g = dn.DynGraph()
#add vertices and edges with time information added
#adding the edge ("D","E") at t=0 that vanishes at time e=2
g.add_interaction(u="D", v="E", t=0, e=2)
# adding some edges at time t=1
g.add_interactions_from([("C", "F"), ("F", "E")], t=1)
# adding some edges at time t=2
g.add_interactions_from([("B", "E"), ("A", "B")], t=2)
# adding some edges at time t=3
g.add_interactions_from([("B", "C"),("C","D")], t=3)
# adding some edges at time t=4
g.add_interaction(u="A", v="C", t=4)</pre> <p class="calibre3">Once we have <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.4</em> created, we can return a list of snapshots, each of which represents a static view of the lion<a id="_idIndexMarker352" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> network at different points in time. These snapshots are essentially instances of the graph at different timestamps. Let’s add to <code>Script 8.1</code> to show these plots:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#create plots for each time point
for i in range (5):
    g1 = g.time_slice(i)
    nx.draw(g1,with_labels=True)
    print ("snapshot at t = ", i)
    plt.show()</pre> <p class="calibre3">We can print the list of edges for each snapshot, as well. Let’s add to <code>Script 8.1</code> to get a list of edges at each time point:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#create lists of edges at each time point
for i in range (5):
    g1 = g.time_slice(i)
    print ("snapshot at t = ", i)
    print(g1.edges())</pre> <p class="calibre3">This should give us the following analysis of edges at each time point, shown next:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
snapshot at t =  0
[('D', 'E')]
snapshot at t =  1
[('D', 'E'), ('E', 'F'), ('F', 'C')]
snapshot at t =  2
[('E', 'B'), ('B', 'A')]
snapshot at t =  3
[('D', 'C'), ('C', 'B')]
snapshot at t =  4
[('C', 'A')]</pre> <p class="calibre3">Understanding edge structure at each time point is critical in the assessment of network structure and properties that facilitate flow on the network, such as hubs and bridges. Visualization and edge lists provide us a way to summarize information, as well, which might provide added insight into, say, an epidemic through a small population. Moving away from our lion example, let’s consider badge tracking in an office setting during the outbreak of a new disease (such as COVID-19). Different individuals will interact with different people and different numbers of people in the office on different days, depending on their schedules. Lists of edges that exist at different time points and visualizations of interactions among employees can help researchers track the new outbreak and calculate important epidemic model parameters to understand the potential impact of the disease on a larger population.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just as connections <a id="_idIndexMarker353" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>between individuals can change over time, so can the individuals in the network themselves. Perhaps one employee is out sick or takes a personal day, thus dropping out of the network at that time point. With <code>DyNetx</code>, we can also create an interaction network to model a dynamic structure in which both vertices and edges can appear and disappear as time evolves. Returning to <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, let’s add to <code>Script 8.1</code> to create the following interaction stream:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#print interaction stream
for i in g.stream_interactions():
    print(i)</pre> <p class="calibre3">This script creates an interaction list for each time point, denoting interactions that exist in the network. While we don’t have individual lions leaving or entering our network, lion interactions do change, and lions may or may not have interactions with other lions in the network for a given time point. Let’s look a bit further at the output to see which time points involve the most and least interaction among the network lions:</p>
<pre class="console">
#output of interactions for each time point
('D', 'E', '+', 0)
('C', 'F', '+', 1)
('F', 'E', '+', 1)
('D', 'E', '-', 2)
('B', 'E', '+', 2)
('A', 'B', '+', 2)
('B', 'C', '+', 3)
('C', 'D', '+', 3)
('A', 'C', '+', 4)</pre> <p class="calibre3">The first two values specify the vertices participating in an edge. The third value designates the type of edge operation, with <code>'+'</code> indicating an appearance (edge creation) and <code>'-'</code> denoting vanishing (edge removal). The last value signifies the timestamp associated with the edge operation. For instance, we can see that lion F establishes multiple interactions within the network at time point <code>1</code>. We can also see that lions <code>D</code> and <code>E</code>, whose<a id="_idIndexMarker354" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> interaction began at the 0th time point, cease interaction at time point <code>2</code>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This type of information is critical for epidemic tracking, as it allows us to narrow down contacts to perform contact tracing. <strong class="bold">Contact tracing</strong> involves<a id="_idIndexMarker355" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> working backward through time and interactions among impacted individuals to find the original patient (<strong class="bold">patient zero</strong>) who was infected with the disease of interest. This allows epidemiologists to determine the geographic region from which the outbreak started as well as trace its evolution over time and space from patient zero. Some diseases mutate rapidly, which complicates the development of a treatment. What works today may not work with the next mutation. This is why flu vaccines are typically given annually, as flu strains mutate regularly. However, some diseases mutate very slowly or not at all, allowing for effective treatments or vaccines.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we know a bit about dynamic network construction in Python, let’s explore <strong class="bold">susceptible-infected-resistant</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIR</strong>) models in a bit more depth than we did in <a href="B21087_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>.</p>
<div><h2 id="_idParaDest-105" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor105" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>SIR models, Part Two</h2>
<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B21087_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, we explored SIR models to<a id="_idIndexMarker356" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> track network spreading processes, but we did not go into technical detail regarding the differential equations. In this section, we will dive a bit further into SIR model mathematics. Let’s start by defining the terms we’ll use in our model:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">S(t)</em> represents the number of susceptible individuals at time <em class="italic">t</em>: those who do not have the disease but can contract it</li>
<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">I(t)</em> represents the number of infectious individuals at time <em class="italic">t</em>: those who are actively infected and able to pass along the disease to susceptible individuals</li>
<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">R(t)</em> represents the number of recovered individuals at time <em class="italic">t</em>: those who no longer are infected and cannot be reinfected due to immunity</li>
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="source-inline1">beta</strong> (<em class="italic">β</em>) is the transmission rate of infected individuals to a population of susceptible individuals</li>
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="source-inline1">gamma</strong> (<em class="italic">γ</em>) is the recovery rate (the rate at which infected individuals become recovered individuals)</li>
<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">N</em> is the total population size</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">The populations <a id="_idIndexMarker357" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals will change over time as individuals become infected and later recover. We can define the population numbers at each time point by relating these populations to the transmission and recovery rates in a series of equations defined by time. The susceptible population will decline as disease is transmitted from infected individuals to susceptible individuals. The infected population may grow or decline at a given time point as more susceptible individuals become infected and as more infected individuals recover. The recovered population will grow over time as infected individuals recover from the disease.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For more technically minded readers, we can arrange these terms to define a system of differential equations governing spread and recovery within a population of susceptible individuals, as shown next:</p>
<p class="calibre3"><img alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;β&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;I&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;mo&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" src="img/1.png" class="calibre16"/></p>
<p class="calibre3"><img alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;I&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;β&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;I&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;N&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;γ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;I&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" src="img/2.png" class="calibre17"/></p>
<p class="calibre3"><img alt="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;R&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;γ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;I&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" src="img/3.png" class="calibre18"/></p>
<p class="calibre3">A high transmission rate coupled with a low recovery rate will yield a large population of infected individuals. A low transmission rate with a high recovery rate will result in a slow or fizzling-out epidemic in the population.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, interactions <a id="_idIndexMarker358" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>within a population are rarely random, as assumed by the SIR equations. Dynamic networks provide a way to capture interactions over time, leading to more accurate models of transmission within a population of interest or allowing for more accurate planning through simulated models of interaction levels within a population of interest. Let’s build on <a href="B21087_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>’s discussion of epidemics by introducing some new network metrics that influence epidemic spread.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-106" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor106" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Factors influencing spread</h2>
<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B21087_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, we examined the importance of bridges and hubs to the spread of a music trend or epidemic across networks. Since then, we’ve considered many network centrality metrics that relate to the concepts of hubs and bridges. Let’s briefly review a few of these<a id="_idIndexMarker359" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> centrality metrics.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hubness can be assessed with several centrality metrics, including the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Degree centrality (defined in <a href="B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>)</li>
<li class="calibre11">PageRank centrality (defined in <a href="B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>)</li>
<li class="calibre11">Hubness centrality (defined in <a href="B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Degree centrality<a id="_idIndexMarker360" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> is the simplest and most related to spreading processes on a network. The number of connections an infected vertex has to other vertices impacts the ability of an infected vertex to spread the disease to its immediate neighbors. The combination of degree centralities across the network impacts the overall ability of a disease to spread globally. Sparse networks with very low degree centralities don’t offer chances for the disease to infect many individuals at the same time, leading to a situation where public health workers can effectively implement strategies such as isolation and contact tracing without being overwhelmed by many infected patients at a given time point.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, networks with very high degree centralities likely include many hubs or a single large hub. A large hub allows one infected individual to pass along the disease to many others, who also have many contacts who can become infected. This means that public health resources are easily overwhelmed at the start of an epidemic, and the chances of containing such an epidemic before many people are infected are quite low. We saw this in many global cities during COVID-19, and citywide shutdowns became necessary to avoid overwhelming healthcare systems; rural areas did not experience the same rapid spikes of infection rates that we saw in large cities.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Bridges also play an<a id="_idIndexMarker361" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> important role in epidemic modeling on networks. If two large hubs are not connected, it’s easy to isolate one hub from the other to stop an epidemic from spreading from one hub to the other, as we simply ensure that no bridges are built between the two hubs until the epidemic has ended in the infected hub. Bridges connecting the two hubs provide an opportunity for the bridge vertex/vertices to become infected and pass the infection from one community to another. Thus, bridges provide an opportunity for infection to spread and become a regional or global problem rather than a local community problem.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Recall that bridging properties can be measured<a id="_idIndexMarker362" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> through <strong class="bold">betweenness centrality (</strong>defined in<strong class="bold"> </strong><a href="B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><strong class="bold">)</strong>, which measures the number of a network’s shortest paths that pass through a vertex. Essentially, this measures the importance of each vertex to spreading processes on the network. A vertex with a high betweenness centrality represents a high chance of passing a disease to other parts of a population should that vertex become infected. Isolating or vaccinating vertices with a high betweenness centrality can disrupt disease spread on a network, and these individuals represent a chance to make a big impact on overall epidemic severity with limited resources. Within the context of COVID-19, frequent international travelers served as bridges between countries. Halting international travel from infected areas to areas not yet impacted allowed small nations, such as those on Caribbean islands, to avoid epidemic spread to their populations.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Forman-Ricci curvature centrality</strong> (defined in <a href="B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>) accounts for both bridging properties and hub <a id="_idIndexMarker363" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>properties within a network by considering edges connected to other edges through a set of vertices. Recent studies suggest that Forman-Ricci curvature can find edges and vertices important to spreading processes and, thus, serves as an effective metric to use in epidemic simulations where vertices are isolated or otherwise taken out of a population (through vaccination, for instance).</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Eccentricity</strong>, the maximum <a id="_idIndexMarker364" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>distance from a vertex to another vertex in a graph, is another metric commonly used to measure the potential impact of an epidemic at a population level. The <strong class="bold">radius</strong> of a <a id="_idIndexMarker365" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>network is the smallest eccentricity value across network vertices, and the <strong class="bold">diameter</strong> of a <a id="_idIndexMarker366" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>network is the largest eccentricity value across network vertices. Dense networks have smaller diameters than sparse networks, as vertices tend to be more interconnected (allowing for greater spread potential in shorter periods of time).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Both radius and diameter bound the behavior of differential equations, such as our SIR model, on a network. While the theoretical proofs are beyond the scope of this book, we’ll explore radius and diameter in practice with a real-world simulation of two wildlife epidemic datasets in the next section. Let’s get started by exploring our datasets.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-107" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor107" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Example with evolving wildlife interaction datasets</h1>
<p class="calibre3">We collected two <a id="_idIndexMarker367" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>datasets on within-species wildlife interactions (interactions involving animals of the same species) over short periods of time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first dataset includes the observation of 4 crocodiles in a South Florida lagoon across 15-minute intervals over 12 time periods after a cold front passed through the area, prompting more crocodiles to seek out sunny shorelines. Social interactions between crocodiles were defined as animals that interacted within a single 15-minute period. Connections were noted for each 15 minutes, giving a dynamic network of crocodile social interactions across 12 time periods.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The second dataset includes the observation of 7 blue herons interacting at a bait ball of migrating fish in a South Florida lagoon captured across 5-minute intervals over 10 time periods. Interaction among blue herons was defined as herons occupying the same cubic meter of space above the bait ball. Connections were noted for each 5 minutes, giving a dynamic network of blue heron social interactions across 10 time periods. Populations were initially separated into two nesting communities, with two herons in one community and five herons in the other community.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s get started by examining the epidemic dynamics and centrality metrics on the <code>Crocodile </code><code>Network</code> dataset.</p>

This may impact the dynamics of an epidemic, as crocodiles have more varied interactions later in the observation period. In addition, early additions of interactions provide the opportunity for a disease to spread across the population, as crocodiles begin to interact with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s consider an epidemic that starts with the infection of one crocodile with a high infection rate (<code>beta</code> = <code>0.3</code>) relative to the recovery rate (<code>gamma</code> = <code>0.05</code>). This corresponds to a moderately infectious disease passing through our crocodile population that results in a long infection period. Crocodile pox is one such disease that can cause mortality in juvenile crocodiles. Infected animals tend to be symptomatic for weeks or months. Infection of cells tends to happen rapidly with a low incubation period (minutes). While the exact parameters for infection rate and recovery rate are not known, these estimates are good proxies for the infection. Let’s add to <code>Script 8.2</code> to simulate crocodile pox spread in our population of crocodiles as they interact over 12 time periods:</p>

Given that this is a probabilistic model, your epidemic may proceed a bit differently with respect to time points or the number of infected crocodiles at a given point in time. The plot summarizes the number of susceptible, infected, and removed (recovered) crocodiles at each time point of the epidemic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In our trial, this crocodile pox epidemic starts rapidly with the infection of a single crocodile at period <code>0</code> and quickly infects the entire population by period <code>5</code>, with none of the animals recovered by the end of observation. Any new animals introduced into the population who were not immune to crocodile pox would likely catch crocodile pox soon after entering the population and remain sick throughout the observation period. This suggests a need to quarantine the infected crocodiles to avoid epidemic spread in wild populations (perhaps by isolation and treatment in a local rehabilitation center):</p>

Solitary species tend to have lower rates of infectious disease spread than species forming large herds or flocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Naturally occurring phenomena such as bait balls or temporary water sources after a storm provide time-limited interaction opportunities for disease to spread among solitary species or isolated herds. As such, they present an opportunity for conservationists to study epidemic potentials within populations of animals that may not interact frequently aside from a one-time event involving needed resources such as food or water. Models such as the ones we’ve examined provide the tools for estimating the impact of infectious disease on populations that are normally isolated but mix at such events.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we explored dynamic networks and how changes in network structure over time impact epidemic spread using examples of disease spread among crocodile and blue heron populations. We also explored the relationship between network metrics and epidemic spread, noting patterns of connectivity associated with higher rates of spread and more severe epidemics within a hypothesized population. These tools are critical to understanding trends and epidemics spread across real-world networks, allowing researchers to plan out critical infrastructure to deal with crises such as COVID-19 or Ebola in human populations, infectious diseases threatening endangered animal populations, fake news before a country’s elections, or dangerous behavioral trends spreading among youth on social media.</p>
