    different aggregations, such as `sum` or `average`, to this grouped data to get
    a holistic view of data slices.

    is similar to `groupBy` in SQL in that we can do group-wise operations on these
    grouped datasets. Moreover, we can specify multiple `groupBy` criteria in a single
    `groupBy` statement. The following example shows how to use `groupBy` in PySpark.

    done in this statement. Currently, it says `inner` because we wanted the DataFrames
    to join based on an inner join. We can also see that IDs `7` and `8` are missing.
    The reason is that the `employee_data` DataFrame did not contain IDs `7` and `8`.
    Since we’re using an inner join, it only joins data based on common data elements
    in both DataFrames. Any data that is not present in either one of the DataFrames
    will not be part of the resulting DataFrame.

    the resulting DataFrame.

    merging employee data with project data to see which employees are assigned to
    which projects, including those not currently assigned to any.

    resulting DataFrame, IDs `7` and `8` are now present. However, also notice that
    the `ID`, `State`, and `Gender` columns for IDs `7` and `8` are `null`. The reason
    is that the `employee_data` DataFrame did not contain IDs `7` and `8`. Any data
    not present in either of the DataFrames would be part of the resulting DataFrame,
    but the corresponding columns would be `null` for the DataFrame that this was
    not present, as shown in the case of employee IDs `7` and `8`.

    customer data with transaction data to see which customers have made a purchase.

    `8` are present. However, also notice that the `ID`, `State`, and `Gender` columns
    for IDs `7` and `8` are `null`. The reason is that the `employee_data` DataFrame
    did not contain IDs `7` and `8`. Since `salary_data_with_id` is the left DataFrame
    in the join statement, its values take priority in the join.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    memory efficiently. You can release cached data from memory using the `.unpersist()`
    method. This method allows you to specify whether to release the data immediately
    or only when it is no longer needed.

- en: Data partitioning in Apache Spark involves dividing a dataset into smaller,
    manageable units called partitions. Each partition contains a subset of the data
    and is processed independently by different worker nodes in a distributed cluster.

    of partitions. This operation can help balance data distribution, improve parallelism,
    and optimize data processing. You can use the `.repartition()` method to specify
