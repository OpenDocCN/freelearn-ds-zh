<h1 id="_idParaDest-29" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Wrangling Data into Networks with NetworkX and igraph</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will introduce many types of data that are common in analytics projects, including <code>NetworkX</code> and <code>igraph</code> packages.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We’ll consider many real-world problems in this chapter and the remaining chapters to build intuition around data that can be reformatted and analyzed as a network science problem. Oftentimes, network-based algorithms have lower computational costs than algorithms designed for time series analytics or spatial data. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to recognize many types of problems that work well with network analytics, and you’ll walk away equipped to dive into the problems in later chapters.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Specifically, we will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">

<h1 id="_idParaDest-30" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="calibre3">To run the practical examples in this chapter, you need to be familiar with Python programming and must install the <code>igraph</code> and <code>NetworkX</code> Python packages.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The code for this chapter is available here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Graph-Theory-Algorithms-with-Python" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Graph-Theory-Algorithms-with-Python</a></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-31" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Introduction to different data sources</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In practice, we’ll rarely create a <a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>network from scratch or come across a data source that naturally occurs as a network. We often must create a network from different data sources, including survey or sensor data, geographic data, time series data, demographic data, or even output data from machine learning models. In this section, we’ll overview some common data sources before diving into two practical examples of data wrangling with igraph and NetworkX. Let’s dive into our first data source, social interaction data.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-32" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor032" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Social interaction data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Much of network<a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> science originated with <a id="_idIndexMarker057" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>social networks, which capture relationships or interactions between individuals. Marketing campaigns often recruit individuals with many connections to others within a demographic group of interest, as well as those whose connections also have many connections within a demographic group. For instance, a toy manufacturer might have a new toy coming out for the Christmas season, perhaps a <em class="italic">steampunk nutcracker ballet mouse king doll</em> (shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.1</em>), that they would like to market to European girls between the ages of 5 and 11 based on market research about which age and gender groups are most likely to see the Nutcracker ballet:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Marketing advertisement for the new Mouse King doll debuting at Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre3">The toy manufacturer may<a id="_idIndexMarker058" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> look for<a id="_idIndexMarker059" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> social media influencers (individuals with many subscribers on YouTube or followers on TikTok) whose network of viewers includes mostly girls between 5 and 11 years old who are viewing the influencer’s content from Europe. Sometimes, this data is readily available by scraping influencers’ content. Other times, this data needs to be collected in pieces and analyzed first to narrow down influencers among the demographic groups of interest through content curation and the scraping of related content metrics.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Another common source of data for social network construction is <strong class="bold">survey data</strong>, in <a id="_idIndexMarker060" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>which individuals rank friendships or interaction patterns with others in a social group. For instance, students might indicate other students with whom they study, socialize, or attend classes. Students who interact with each other in many settings share stronger social interactions, while students who interact infrequently or only in certain settings share weaker social interactions. Weighted social networks can visualize not only interactions that exist but also their strengths. In social science settings, stronger ties often play an important role in the transmission of information or the adoption of products or behaviors. For instance, when an adolescent begins smoking or drinking alcohol, individuals with strong ties to that individual are at higher risk of starting those behaviors themselves. Within highly connected groups of adolescents, the risk of behavior spreading is high among the group when one individual adopts a risky behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Weaker social ties <a id="_idIndexMarker061" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>can be just as important as strong social ties (or even more important!), and within the field of sociology, these ties form the basis of an individual’s social capital. Social capital measures the resources upon which an individual can draw when needed from those with whom the individual has connected or those connected to an individual’s connections. Within the context of job searches, a job seeker’s strongest and most-lasting ties may not be what is needed to find a new job. However, it is likely that friends-of-friends and acquaintances form a much larger social network, and these ties may present <a id="_idIndexMarker062" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>new employment opportunities to the job seeker. Larger networks of friends-of-friends and casual acquaintances often provide more opportunities to find that next job through word-of-mouth or job ad posts on social media.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We’ll return to survey-based social network data in this chapter’s <em class="italic">Wrangling data into networks with igraph</em> section where we construct a network of students based on endorsement interactions across social contexts.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-33" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor033" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Spatial data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Another common source of <a id="_idIndexMarker063" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>network<a id="_idIndexMarker064" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> data is data collected from geographic information systems or organized by geography. <strong class="bold">Spatial data analytics</strong> is a branch of <a id="_idIndexMarker065" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>data science that analyzes geography-based data; however, when data covers large geographic regions or involves complex statistical calculations, it can be easier to formulate the data and problem in terms of network science. Network algorithms are often faster than spatial data algorithms, and it is easy to store large networks in graph databases such as Neo4j.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Consider the worldwide spread of COVID-19 through travel networks. The pandemic originated in China but quickly spread to other parts of Asia, as well as the rest of the world, through the travel of infected but not terribly sick individuals on airplanes, trains, and other means of transportation (such as flights from Beijing to Paris, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.2</em>). Air travel also allowed new variants to spread from one continent to another during the pandemic. Fortunately, COVID-19 had a low case fatality rate and did not cause severe disease in most people who were infected. However, a highly infectious disease similar to COVID-19, but with a high fatality rate and a long incubation period from infection to the display of symptoms (such as a more infectious version of Ebola) spreading through the same travel networks would create a very severe global health crisis before it was detected. As we’ll see in later chapters, epidemic threats with spatial and social components can be modeled and simulated through network science.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Health-related <a id="_idIndexMarker066" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>networks aren’t the<a id="_idIndexMarker067" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> only spatial data sources useful in data science. One common source of spatial data is retail data, where stores exist in different locations and may carry different products, sell products at different rates, and adjust prices to match regional norms. Customer demographics may also vary significantly across locations and produce very different buying patterns. For instance, consider customers‘ buying behavior at a store near a university versus customers’ buying behavior at a store in the suburbs. The store near a university may have more late-night purchases, sell a lot of snacks, and rarely need to stock diapers relative to the store in the suburbs. Analysis of customers’ buying behavior, goods pricing, or out-of-stock frequency across products and geographies of stores can yield valuable strategic insight for individual stores and their parent chains interested in optimizing stocks, prices, and timing of promotions. We’ll wrangle data related to millet prices at local<a id="_idIndexMarker068" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> markets into <a id="_idIndexMarker069" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>a network later in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-34" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor034" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Temporal data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Networks are rarely <a id="_idIndexMarker070" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>static. Social <a id="_idIndexMarker071" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>networks evolve over time as connections forge and break. Sales patterns change as new items are added, needs for specific items change over seasons, or changes in the economy spur changes in consumer behavior. Stock market trading volumes and industry/regional correlations change over time as political and business climates change.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All these changes involve a time component in the data. There are a few ways to model time trends in networks, and we’ll start with two use cases and build out more uses in <em class="italic">Part 3</em> of this book.</p>
<p class="calibre3">First, let’s return to our example of a job seeker leveraging his or her social network to find a new job. As this individual begins a job search, they may add suggested professional connections on LinkedIn, attend local networking events, or connect with a few recruiters looking to hire; all these actions add connections to their social network (and increase the likelihood of finding a new job). <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.3</em> shows women meeting at a networking event, forging new professional connections to leverage in their job searches:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.3 – A changing social network over 8 weeks" src="img/B21087_02_03.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – A changing social network over 8 weeks</p>
<p class="calibre3">We can represent <a id="_idIndexMarker072" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>changes over time as a series of networks, each denoting a specific time when we capture the job seeker’s social network. We may collect the data daily or weekly or even monthly for the period we are interested in analyzing. Let’s say we capture data weekly for two months. This will give us roughly eight social networks, which we can analyze and summarize to track changes in network size and density of connections over time. Perhaps we also have data related to interviews our job seeker obtained, which we can examine along with the changes in their social network to gain insight into how social network growth has helped our job seeker obtain a new job.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To study how social ties <a id="_idIndexMarker073" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>and specific activities increase the likelihood of job interviews and offers, we could recruit a few hundred job seekers, collect information on interviews/offers and their current social network each week for eight weeks, and build a regression model to predict job interviews or job offers based on prior weeks’ social network metrics. In a more sophisticated analysis, we could use a type of regression model that includes time series components to account for time effects, as well as social network metrics and initial data on job seekers (such as demographic data, career information, educational history…). We’ll consider this type of model in <a href="B21087_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor167" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spatial data can also include time components, where new flights are added between countries or where stores’ management structure changes over time to create different connections between stores within a retail chain. We’ve already seen how we can wrangle spatial data into <a id="_idIndexMarker074" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>networks. For <strong class="bold">spatiotemporal data</strong>, we can build networks at an instant in time where we sample the data (as in our job networking example), or we can chunk our data into time periods, create networks for each time period, and then consider the full series of networks in our analysis. In the retail store example, we might have real-time purchase behavior to parse into weekly trend networks, where stores are connected based on the similarity of sales across the full inventory of store pairs. We might be interested in analyzing how buying trends change over the month of December, when people celebrate New Year’s, Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and end-of-year business deals. We’ll consider examples of this in the <em class="italic">Wrangling data into networks with </em><em class="italic">igraph</em> section.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-35" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor035" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Biological networks</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Network science plays a <a id="_idIndexMarker075" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>prominent role in modern genomics research. Environmental <a id="_idIndexMarker076" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>factors, such as stress or eating habits, can modify which genes are expressed within a cell or tissue by making <a id="_idIndexMarker077" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>transcription of <strong class="bold">deoxyribonucleic acid</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNA</strong>) more or less likely for a set of genes, leading to higher or lower levels of proteins produced by translating the genetic code to <strong class="bold">ribonucleic acid</strong> (<strong class="bold">RNA</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker078" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>then to proteins (<em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.4</em>):</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.4 – A diagram showing the processes by which genes are expressed, transcribed, and translated into proteins" src="img/B21087_02_04.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – A diagram showing the processes by which genes are expressed, transcribed, and translated into proteins</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s consider a concrete <a id="_idIndexMarker079" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>example. Cobras are venomous snakes, and their<a id="_idIndexMarker080" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> DNA encodes genes related to venom production. Transcription of these genes happens in the venom glands that produce venom and store it until the snake strikes a target. The DNA encoding these genes is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into a protein.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Gene sets transcribed together are said to <a id="_idIndexMarker081" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>be <strong class="bold">coexpressed</strong>; <strong class="bold">coexpression networks</strong> are useful<a id="_idIndexMarker082" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> in understanding the relationship between genetic factors and diseases or physical traits. In our snake venom example, genes encoding venom would be coexpressed in the venom gland, as all of the venom is produced in that part of the snake’s body. Environmental factors can indirectly influence the expression patterns of genes by modifying the DNA structures to upregulate or downregulate transcription. For instance, when our snake bites in self-defense, it may empty its venom gland completely with the bite. This will cause DNA related to venom genes to be upregulated, allowing for more venom production to replenish the snake’s supply so that it can eat and defend itself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The field of <strong class="bold">epigenetics</strong> studies <a id="_idIndexMarker083" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>these gene-environment interactions, particularly in the development of complex diseases such as cancer or mental health disorders. Typically, gene expression within or across tissues is measured through protein binding on genes of interest using some sort of microarray chip. Many human diseases involve a more complex interplay of environment and genes than the regulation of venom levels in a snake’s venom gland; some of these diseases involve many parts of the body.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For example, some people face higher risks of alcohol use disorders based on their aggregation of genetic risk factors; when a person at risk of alcohol use disorder begins drinking, alcohol crosses the blood-brain barrier and produces epigenetic changes in gene expression, including changes in expression of the genes that put the person at risk for the disorder. Microarrays measure the level of gene expression experimentally. Microarray studies of coexpression of genes in those with alcohol use disorders and those without alcohol use disorders provide insight into genetic risk and the epigenetic differences that occur because of alcohol consumption. Networks provide a convenient way to summarize expression similarity relationships and can be mined for subnetworks related to modules of related genes that perform a similar task (such as producing neurotransmitter binding sites related to serotonin or dopamine binding at synapses).</p>
<p class="calibre3">A related phenomenon in<a id="_idIndexMarker084" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> genetic studies is the regulation of gene expression, typically<a id="_idIndexMarker085" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> through epigenetic pathways, as well. As we’ve discussed, external environmental factors can influence gene expression; often, proteins created from gene transcription and translation regulate their own transcription, turning expression up or down based on the levels of proteins that exist. For instance, disruptions in gene regulation related to serotonin receptors in the frontal cortex are thought to underlie major depressive disorder, and disruptions to downregulation of cell growth genes are thought to underlie a lot of common cancer pathways, leading to uncontrolled growth and mitosis (tumors).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Directed networks provide an ideal way to summarize gene regulation pathways. Different biological and environmental mechanisms upregulate or downregulate the genes of interest. Genes may cluster into similar regulatory patterns within the mechanisms of study (protein expression, external exposures in the environment…). This gives insight into specific pathologies of interest or the impacts of environmental factors like stress.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Genomic studies sometimes leverage network science to map gene ontologies (networks that summarize hierarchical relationships of individual genes or genetic modules) to disease ontologies (networks that summarize categories of disorders). We’ll dive deeper into ontology research in <a href="B21087_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, but let’s review some basics here. The mapping between ontologies allows researchers to formulate hypotheses regarding unknown genetic links to disorders based on known links between genes and similar diseases. Returning to substance abuse disorders, many genetic risk factors are known and shared across addictions; it is likely that newer behavioral addictions, such as video game addiction, share at least some of these genetic factors with other addictive disorders. Ontology mapping <a id="_idIndexMarker086" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>between <a id="_idIndexMarker087" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>genes and diseases provides a starting point for studying these new disorders.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Genomics</strong> is one of <a id="_idIndexMarker088" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>many types of data where network solutions aren’t an obvious toolset for solving data problems. Let’s look at some other examples where network science has provided insight not possible with other analytics tools.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-36" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor036" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Other types of data</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Many other sources of data exist, and<a id="_idIndexMarker089" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> most can be wrangled into network form. Let’s return to our discussion<a id="_idIndexMarker090" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> of <strong class="bold">deep learning</strong>. In the training process of deep learning, nodes in each layer of the neural network forge and break connections with nodes in other layers based on fit metrics in each iteration of the training. Let’s consider a training process with four training epochs of a very small feedforward neural network with an input layer of two nodes, a hidden layer of three nodes, and an output layer of two nodes that originates as a fully-connected network, undergoes two epochs of pruning, and then adds back one of the pruned connections between the hidden and output layers, shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.5</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.5 – The evolution of a simple deep learning model across training epochs" src="img/B21087_02_05.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – The evolution of a simple deep learning model across training epochs</p>
<p class="calibre3">In <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, we can see how each epoch has a different network structure across the deep learning model. Typically, we calculate fit statistics for each epoch, and perhaps we are interested in how properties of the deep learning network structure influence training accuracy on training and test sets across epochs. While this model is quite simple, deep learning models in practice may have several layers, directed edges between vertices (nodes in deep learning parlance), and many epochs of training. This creates a rich set of networks and network metrics across training to relate to model accuracy, which may be of use when tuning the model or changing initial parameters (perhaps adjusting pruning parameters when fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Fine-tuning pre-trained models is<a id="_idIndexMarker091" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> a common approach in <em class="italic">computer vision</em> and <em class="italic">large language modeling</em>. New training data to cover domain-specific use cases may be added, and model parameters need adjusting to incorporate the new training data into the full model. For instance, a large language model housed on HuggingFace might work well for embedding most scientific papers for cluster analysis but require fine-tuning to work well when plasma physics papers are included in the sample of scientific papers. Understanding the network structure of the original large language model and its training evolution can help researchers set optimal parameters in the fine-tuning process.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Another example of data that <a id="_idIndexMarker092" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>can be wrangled into network form to study is <strong class="bold">linguistics data</strong>. Many languages that exist today evolved from much older languages. For instance, the Semitic languages that exist today, including Hebrew and Arabic, originated from a Proto-Semitic language, which split into different regional branches as proto-Semitic speakers migrated and settled across the Middle East. One language, East Semitic (Akkadian) did not further branch to other languages; the other language, West Semitic, broke into South Semitic and Central South Semitic (which further broke into new languages over time). <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.6</em> shows the initial evolution of Proto-Semitic into new language<a id="_idIndexMarker093" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> groups:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.6 – A diagram of early language evolution from Proto-Semitic" src="img/B21087_02_06.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – A diagram of early language evolution from Proto-Semitic</p>
<p class="calibre3">Network science can help us compare language evolutions from original proto-languages to modern languages through the analysis of language family hierarchies. Comparing the structure of language evolution can illuminate ancient migration and trading patterns that can be difficult to discern from ancient records or archaeological sites. In addition, this comparison allows us to forecast future language splits based on the past behavior of the language family, similar evolution patterns seen in other language families, sociolinguistic data on language usage patterns, and the usage extent of current pidgins or dialects. We’ll return to linguistic applications in <a href="B21087_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, where we consider language ontologies of languages spoken in Africa and their evolutions over<a id="_idIndexMarker094" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For now, let’s turn our attention to network creation in igraph and NetworkX from raw data files. This will equip us to create networks to analyze with tools we’ll introduce in the coming chapters. First, we’ll consider an example involving spatiotemporal data: quarterly millet prices across provincial markets in Burkina Faso.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-37" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor037" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Wrangling data into networks with igraph</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Understanding<a id="_idIndexMarker095" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> trends in goods pricing is critical in many applications. For instance, a chain of gas stations may want to understand the differences in pricing across its locations. Often, local laws require gas stations within a certain distance of each other to be priced within a certain range of each other, creating local distributions of pricing across chains and within chains. Understanding this can help optimize prices regionally given constraints in each area or tie the data back to regional sales data to see how price distributions impact sales.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Consumers can also benefit from analyses of goods pricing across geographic areas. Consider local food markets in the developing world. Prices are rarely fixed within a country or region. They are dictated by supply, demand, and cost to the merchant selling the goods. Grains may need to be imported from other countries, whose prices will fluctuate with economic and climate conditions. Fruit prices may vary with season and local growing conditions. Clothing may increase in price as dyes become scarcer in the local area. For instance, consider a grocery store, shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, with supplier contracts and the financial backing of a parent chain. It may experience fluctuations in goods availability or price but will likely have the same goods at prices that don’t fluctuate a lot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.7 – ﻿An illustration of a grocery store, part of a larger chain" src="img/B21087_02_07.jpg" class="calibre4"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – An illustration of a grocery store, part of a larger chain</p>
<p class="calibre3">Contrast this with a<a id="_idIndexMarker096" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> local market comprised of different vendors who may or may not be at the market on a given day and whose goods’ availability and prices might fluctuate on the days they sell at the market. Larger markets, such as the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.8</em>, with more established vendors and peak hours might show less variation than the more informal markets that line the streets throughout the day.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.8 – ﻿An illustration of a large, formal marketplace in Burkina Faso, where there is some commonality from day to day in vendors and their goods" src="img/B21087_02_08.jpg" class="calibre4"/>

<p class="calibre3">When considering <a id="_idIndexMarker097" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>geography, we often want to consider not only the variable(s) of interest but also how close together the locations are relative to each other. Prices, sales, and goods availability in regions near each other likely reflect local conditions that aren’t observed in the dataset, such as local weather, the local political context, and the number of competing local merchants. We’ll discuss this topic further in <em class="italic">Chapters 3</em>, <em class="italic">4</em>, and <em class="italic">5</em>, but for now, it suffices to know that we can assign weights to different locations according to their relative distances.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Another factor to consider when wrangling spatial data is the metric of choice. Many spatial statistical metrics exist, and those of you familiar with spatial data analytics may want to use more sophisticated metrics than the ones we’ll consider in this text. The <strong class="bold">local Moran statistic</strong>, a common<a id="_idIndexMarker098" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> metric in spatial data analytics, sums the weights between spatial areas and a function defined on the data in a pairwise manner; here, we construct the statistic using weight matrices we define and the correlation function, which should be familiar to readers as a summary statistic of likeness between data points.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s dive into our example dataset, derived from Humanitarian Data Exchange’s Burkina Faso – Food Prices dataset from the World Food Programme Price Database (<a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-burkina-faso" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1">https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-burkina-faso</a>; accessed July 15, 2022). In this dataset, we have pre-selected millet prices across 45 Burkina Faso province markets and aggregated data by quarter, starting in Quarter 2 of 2015 and ending in Quarter 2 of 2022. This period covers the COVID-19 pandemic and the beginning of the Ukraine War, both of which influenced supply chains. Given that markets in neighboring provinces may be impacted by the same local factors and supply chains, we have created a spatial weight matrix of 1’s and 0’s, representing adjacent provinces and non-adjacent provinces respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To run all of the code, it may be necessary to install other packages that are dependencies of <code>igraph</code> or <code>NetworkX</code>, such as <code>pycairo</code> for visualizations. Each machine may function differently or have other packages already installed if you are using a cloud platform; if you run into any difficulties, please consult the igraph or NetworkX help guides’ suggestions for running the packages on your operating system.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s first import the needed packages to construct our network in igraph with <code>Script 2.1</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#import packages
import igraph as ig
from igraph import Graph
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os</pre> <p class="calibre3">When importing data, you’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker099" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>need to specify your own file path after you download the dataset. We import both the pricing data and the weight matrix from a local machine by adding to <code>Script 2.1</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#import Burkina Faso market millet prices from the csv file
File="C:/users/njfar/OneDrive/Desktop/BF_Millet.csv"
pwd=os.getcwd()
os.chdir(os.path.dirname(File))
mydata = pd.read_csv(os.path.basename(File),encoding='latin1')
#import weight matrix of Burkina Faso markets
File="C:/users/njfar/OneDrive/Desktop/weights_bk.csv"
pwd=os.getcwd()
os.chdir(os.path.dirname(File))
weights = pd.read_csv(os.path.basename(File),encoding='latin1')</pre> <p class="calibre3">Now that we have our data imported, we can construct our local Moran statistic by computing the correlation coefficient across markets (ignoring the time indicator column) and multiplying the result by the weight matrix:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#define the metric between markets and construct the local Moran #statistic
#here, correlation coefficient
data=mydata.iloc[:,1:46]
weights_total=weights.iloc[:,1:46]
cor=np.corrcoef(data.transpose())
cor[cor&gt;0]=1
cor_weighted=np.multiply(cor,weights_total)</pre> <p class="calibre3">Now that we have our local <a id="_idIndexMarker100" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Moran statistic constructed as <code>cor_weighted</code>, we can turn our data into a network with igraph. Our graph does not have any directionality of relationship, so we can set the mode to <code>undirected</code>. However, because our correlations include autocorrelations within individual markets, we need to remove loops from our network. We’ll do this by defining possible self-loops and removing them from our edge list:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
# create market graph and get rid of loops created from the correlation
bf_market_w=Graph.Adjacency(cor_weighted,mode="undirected")
edge_list=bf_market_w.get_edgelist()
self_loop=[]
for i in range(0,46):
    self=(i,i)
    self_loop.append(self)
to_remove=[]
for i in edge_list:
    for j in self_loop:
        if i==j:
            to_remove.append(i)
bf_market_w.delete_edges(to_remove)</pre> <p class="calibre3">Now, we can visualize our network to see which markets are isolated by plotting our results:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#create plot
ig.plot(bf_market_w)</pre> <p class="calibre3">This should give you a <a id="_idIndexMarker101" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>plot that shows one isolated market and several regionally-connected markets:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – A plot of Burkina Faso markets connected by local Moran statistics</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.9</em> shows that<a id="_idIndexMarker102" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> many markets form regional clusters, where prices are correlated within adjacent provinces. One market is isolated. Most markets connect into groups of three or four markets. One region contains six markets that are regionally connected and connected with pricing trends. Likely, this network visualizes regional connectivity rather than a mix of price correlation and region. We can visualize highly correlated regions by applying a threshold to the correlation calculations before computing the local Moran statistic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s set the correlation threshold to <code>0.9</code> (very high correlation of prices) by modifying <code>Script 2.1</code> to include thresholding in the local Moran statistic calculation piece:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#define the metric between markets and construct 
#the local Moran statistic here, correlation coefficient
data=mydata.iloc[:,1:46]
weights_total=weights.iloc[:,1:46]
cor=np.corrcoef(data.transpose())
cor[cor&gt;=0.9]=1
cor[cor&lt;0.9]=0
cor_weighted=np.multiply(cor,weights_total)
# create market graph and get rid of loops created from the #correlation
bf_market_w=Graph.Adjacency(cor_weighted,mode="undirected")

for i in edge_list:
    for j in self_loop:
        if i==j:
            to_remove.append(i)
bf_market_w.delete_edges(to_remove)
#create plot
ig.plot(bf_market_w)</pre> <p class="calibre3">This should yield many more <a id="_idIndexMarker103" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>isolated markets that are not highly correlated over our time period:</p>

<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.10</em> shows a much <a id="_idIndexMarker104" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>sparser network, where many markets are isolated. Some markets that were regionally connected still show connections among markets; however, many are not mutually connected anymore. Interestingly, our group of six regional markets is still connected with most connections intact after the thresholding. Indeed, only one market in that region shows a difference in connectivity relative to our non-thresholded version.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While this example considers correlations across the entire time period, it is possible to slice spatiotemporal data into overlapping time slices, create time-aware metrics like the local Moran statistic (with or without thresholding), and visualize the metrics’ changes over time by plotting a series of networks created from these time slices and their network-defining metrics. We’ll explore this notion further in <a href="B21087_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a> when we break our Burkina Faso millet dataset into time slices to analyze changing graph metrics over time and space.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we know how to wrangle data into an igraph network, let’s see how this is done in NetworkX with another example.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-38" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor038" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Social network examples with NetworkX</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Here, we’ll consider a social network<a id="_idIndexMarker105" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> of <strong class="bold">African Institute of Mathematical Sciences</strong> (<strong class="bold">AIMS</strong>) students collected from a 2022 cohort in <a id="_idIndexMarker106" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Cameroon. Students in this program live <a id="_idIndexMarker107" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>together in the same building, interact during class, eat meals together, and study together. However, students who share a country, come from the same undergraduate university, and speak the same language tend to interact more frequently than those who come from different backgrounds. Interactions such as those shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.11</em> thus happen either organically as a function of background or artificially through shared programs and living arrangements:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 – An illustration of a classroom setting, where students share courses within a program</p>
<p class="calibre3">To understand these<a id="_idIndexMarker108" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> interactions within our cohort of students, we<a id="_idIndexMarker109" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> administered a questionnaire about interactions with other students in various settings. The data was collected between November and December of 2022. The following are some example questions:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Whom do you like to sit with during lunch or dinner?</li>
<li class="calibre11">Who do you like to ask questions when you are having difficulty with a subject or course?</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">From these questions, students’ perceptions of their networks could be examined to see the degree to which they agree. Upon looking at the data, we realized most interactions were reciprocated. If <em class="italic">Student A</em> endorsed survey items of closeness to <em class="italic">Student B</em>, <em class="italic">Student B</em> was likely to endorse those items, as well. Thus, the data form an undirected network of mutual interactions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The dataset we’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker110" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>use includes several fields. In the first column, we <a id="_idIndexMarker111" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>have the name of the surveyed student. In the next four fields, we have demographic factors (to which we’ll return in later chapters), including country of origin, age, field of study, and undergraduate background. In the remaining five columns, we have five friends that the student most strongly endorsed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s start by importing the packages we’ll need to wrangle this dataset into a network with <code>Script 2.2</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#import needed packages
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import math</pre> <p class="calibre3">Now, let’s import the dataset:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#reading the dataset
fichier = pd.read_csv("C:/users/njfar/OneDrive/Desktop/AIMS_data.csv")
data = pd.DataFrame(fichier)</pre> <p class="calibre3">To turn this data <a id="_idIndexMarker112" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>into a social network with NetworkX, we’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker113" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>need to populate our network with vertices and edges, which we can do through loops. We’ll first add vertices that include metadata including students’ names and demographic characteristics. Then, we’ll add edges that connect vertices based on the five closest relationships a particular student endorsed in our survey by adding to <code>Script 2.2</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#intializing the social network
aimsNetwork = nx.Graph()
#populating the network with nodes and edges
for i in range(len(data["Name"])) :
    aimsNetwork.add_node(data["Name"][i],
        Age = data["Age"][i], country=data["Country"][i],
        Field=data["Field"][i],
        background=data["Background"][i])
    for j in range(len(data["Name"])) :
        aimsNetwork.add_edge(data["Name"][j],data["Friend 1"][j])
        aimsNetwork.add_edge(data["Name"][j],data["Friend 2"][j])
        aimsNetwork.add_edge(data["Name"][j],data["Friend 3"][j])
        aimsNetwork.add_edge(data["Name"][j],data["Friend 4"][j])
        aimsNetwork.add_edge(data["Name"][j],data["Friend 5"][j])</pre> <p class="calibre3">This gives us our initial network of AIMS students and their closest friends within the program. Let’s plot this data to visualize our AIMS student social network. Because we want to show the names of students in our plot, we’ll first compute the degree of each vertex, a centrality metric that we’ll revisit in later chapters. Here, it suffices to show the importance of different students to the network and allow vertices to be large enough to visualize the names of students. Let’s do this by adding to <code>Script 2.2</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
#plot AIMS student social network
Degree=aimsNetwork.degree()
var = [500*k[1] for k in list(Degree)]
plt.figure(figsize=(20,20))
nx.draw_spring(aimsNetwork, font_size=10, node_size = var,
    with_labels=True, node_color="red")
plt.show()</pre> <p class="calibre3">This script should<a id="_idIndexMarker114" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> show an image similar to <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.12</em>, which plots<a id="_idIndexMarker115" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> the social connections between AIMS students:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 – Plot of AIMS Cameroon 2022 students’ social interaction network</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.12</em> shows the network of AIMS students we created from our survey data. Note that some students only have the five closest friends as connections while others have many more close friends. This is typical of a social network, even one created from survey data. Some individuals have more connections than others. Some connect to different parts of a network, linking separated communities. Some highly connected individuals connect to<a id="_idIndexMarker116" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> other highly connected individuals, forming<a id="_idIndexMarker117" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/> dense regions within the larger network. These properties play an important role in network analytics, and we’ll dive deeper into their meanings and computation in later chapters.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-39" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor039" class="pcalibre calibre6 pcalibre1"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’ve explored use cases of networks in more depth, wrangled a spatial market dataset into a network based on regional connectivity and millet price correlation in igraph, and constructed a survey-based social network in NetworkX. Now that we have the basic tools needed to construct networks in Python from real data sources, in the next chapter, we can turn our attention to some real-world applications of network science, where we not only construct a network but analyze it for insights that solve important problems in science today.</p>
