<p class="mce-root">This section is of an advanced level and it will require all of the skills you learned previously. It starts off with learning how to create geospatial models to answer specific questions. Further, it will show you a few techniques for building geospatial models and how it will help to predict the future using visualization concepts. We'll move on to accessing and processing real-time data. At the end of this section, we'll combine all that we learned in the previous sections and implement a system to create an outdoor running or hiking report based on GPS data and geotagged photos.</p>
