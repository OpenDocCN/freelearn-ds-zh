- en: The integration of Python into ArcGIS has made the ArcPy module an important
    tool for GIS students and professionals. The ArcPy module provides a powerful
    way to improve productivity when performing geospatial analysis. From basic Python
    scripting through advanced ArcPy methods and properties, ArcPy and other Python
    modules will improve the speed and repeatability of any GIS work flow.

- en: This book will guide you from basic Python scripting to advanced scripting tools.
    It focuses on geospatial analysis scripting and touches on automating cartographic
    output. By the end of this book, you will be able to create reusable modules,
    add repeatable analyses as script tools in ArcToolbox, and export maps automatically.
    By reducing the time-consuming nature of GIS from days to hours, one GIS professional
    can become as powerful as a whole team.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Python for ArcGIS"), *Introduction
    to Python for ArcGIS*, offers a quick introduction to the basics of Python, including
    other uses for the programming language. It covers Python data types and important
    modules used throughout the book.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Configuring the Python Environment"), *Configuring
    the Python Environment*, is an introduction to how Python works: its folder structure,
    executables, and modules. It also explains importing modules into scripts, the
    built-in modules, and covers Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which
    are powerful programming aids.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Creating the First Python Script"), *Creating
    the First Python Script*, demonstrates how to use ArcGIS ModelBuilder to model
    the first analysis and then export it as a Python script. String manipulations
    and how to use file paths in Python are also introduced.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Complex ArcPy Scripts and Generalizing Functions"),
    *Complex ArcPy Scripts and Generalizing Functions*, examines how to perform analyses
    and produce outputs that are not possible using ModelBuilder. By using functions,
    or reusable code blocks, repeating code is avoided.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. ArcPy Cursors – Search, Insert, and Update"),
    *ArcPy Cursors – Search, Insert, and Update*, covers ArcPy data access cursors
    and how they are used to search, update, or insert records in feature classes
    and tables. It explains the quirks of iterating using cursors, and how to only
    select or update the records of interest.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Working with ArcPy Geometry Objects"), *Working
    with ArcPy Geometry Objects*, explores ArcPy Geometry objects and how they are
    combined with cursors to perform spatial analysis. It demonstrates how to buffer,
    clip, reproject, and more using the data cursors and the Arcpy geometry types
    without using ArcToolbox.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Creating a Script Tool"), *Creating a Script
    Tool*, explains how to make scripts into tools that appear in ArcToolbox and are
    dynamic in nature. It explains how the tools and scripts communicate and how to
    set up the ArcTool dialog to correctly pass parameters to the script.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Introduction to ArcPy.Mapping"), *Introduction
    to ArcPy.Mapping*, explores the powerful Arcpy.Mapping module and how to fix broken
    layer links, turn layers on and off, and dynamically adjust titles and text. It
    shows how to create dynamic map output based on a geospatial analysis.'

    and demonstrates how to create Excel spreadsheets containing results from a geospatial
    analysis.'
