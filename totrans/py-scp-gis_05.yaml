    following three Python libraries will be covered—Shapely, OGR, and GeoPandas.
    The reader will learn how to use these Python libraries to perform geospatial
    analysis, including the writing of basic and advanced analysis scripts.

    methods, and classes where appropriate. We'll discuss the best use cases for each
    library and how to use them together for geospatial workflows. Short example scripts
    illustrate how to perform the basic geographical analysis. The GeoPandas library
    enables more complex functionality for doing data science tasks and incorporating
    geospatial analysis.

    on the GDAL website ([www.gdal.org/python](http://www.gdal.org/python)) but offer
    no code examples, which makes it hard to get started. What's good to know at this
    point is that other Python libraries fill in the gap and offer a more user-friendly
    way to deal with GDAL's capabilities (such as Fiona and GeoPandas). Also, both
    `ogrinfo` and `ogr2ogr` might be preferable over using Python in some use cases,

- en: The following script can be used to create a choropleth map that shows the total
    wildfires in the US from 1984-2015, based on total count per state. We can use
    the MTBS with fire data that was introduced in [Chapter 4](16f36845-4cea-4aa2-8eb4-8b2916c23398.xhtml), *Data
    Types, Storage, and Conversion*, which gives us point data of all of the wildfire
    occurrences from 1984-2015\. We can use the state field of the wildfire data to
    map the wildfire occurrences by state. But, we choose here to overlay the data
    on a separate shapefile with state geometries, to illustrate the use of a spatial
    join. Next, we'll count the total wildfires per state and map the results. GeoPandas
    can be used to accomplish all of these tasks.

    with. For example, listing statistics about your dataset that show you how many
    elements there are, and if there are any missing values. It''s common that data
    has to be cleaned up before doing the analysis. Because the GeoPandas data objects
    are subclasses of `pandas` data objects, you can use their methods to do data
    inspection and cleaning. Take, for instance, the wildfire data shapefile we used
    earlier. By listing our dataframe object, it not only prints all of the attribute
