    all other gates are constructed. When you run your quantum program, it gets interpreted
    by the software, and the fairly complex high-level gate architecture gets `u1`,
    `u2`, `u3`, `id`, and `cx`. It turns out that all quantum programs that you write

    the basis gates that can be run on a backend is called **transpiling** and is
    done before you run the program. The transpiler takes your input score and converts
    it to the basis gates, which are then run on the backend.
  id: totrans-165
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, it turns out that the regular gates that you are using are not always directly
    translatable to a single basis gate. Sometimes the transpiler has to do a bit
    of work, reworking your circuit by replacing your gates with clusters of other
    gates.

    *Quantum Computing and Qubits with Python*, that quantum gates are reversible,
    and that two identical gates following each other might simply cancel out. If
    we let the transpiler go to work, it would just remove the duplicated gates in
    order to simplify the circuit. This is usually not the best solution as the gates
    might be part of a bigger structure that needs to be kept intact.

    each of them into the correct gate type. Take a look at the transpiler version
    of the Grover score and you will see what I mean.

    move or tweak the existing gates to see how your changes cause the circuit to
    behave differently. Don't forget to use the **Inspect** feature, **Measurement
    probabilities**, and **Q-sphere** displays to step through your circuit and see
    what it does.

    quantum score, the `circ` object that you assign it to is now a `QuantumCircuit()`
    object, much in the same way that you will be creating quantum circuits in the
    chapters that follow.

    mainly in your Python Qiskit® environment. If you want to, you can pull the circuits
    that you build over from the IBM Quantum Experience® environment and run them
    here as well. Perhaps you like the graphical drag-and-drop environment better,
    and the option to edit your scores on the fly?

- en: In the Qiskit® Python examples that follow, we will be creating `QuantumCircuit`
    objects that we give names such as `qc`, `circ`, `circuit`, and so on. You can
    export these to QASM and then import them to IBM Quantum Experience® using the
    `circ.qasm(formatted=True, filename="Circuit.qasm")` command.

  zh: 在接下来的Qiskit® Python示例中，我们将创建名为`qc`、`circ`、`circuit`等命名的`QuantumCircuit`对象。你可以将这些导出为QASM，然后使用`circ.qasm(formatted=True,
    filename="Circuit.qasm")`命令将它们导入到IBM Quantum Experience®。

    out the circuit, and then manually recreate it in the composer.
