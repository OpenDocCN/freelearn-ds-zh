    <h1 id="_idParaDest-15" class="chapterTitle">Exploring the IBM Quantum Tools</h1>
    <p class="normal">Quantum computing has been growing in popularity over the past few years, most recently since IBM released the first commercially available quantum computer on the cloud back in May 2016, back<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> then referred to as the IBM Quantum Experience, now<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> rebranded as the <strong class="keyWord">IBM Quantum Platform</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IQP</strong>). This release was the first of its kind, hosted on the cloud and providing the world with the opportunity to experiment with quantum devices for free. The platform includes a <strong class="keyWord">user interface</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">UI</strong>) that allows anyone to run experiments on a real quantum computer. And just recently added was direct access to all documentation and learning resources, such as tutorials and courses, right from the platform, making it easier to run circuits as you learn.</p>
    <p class="normal">The goal of this chapter is to first introduce you to the IBM Quantum Platform, which contains everything you need to learn how to create and run quantum circuits on real quantum systems. It also provides you with courses and tutorials to experiment with existing quantum algorithms and applications. The IBM Quantum Platform is comprised of the following three applications, which you can see listed in the Application Switcher located at the top-right corner of the platform (see <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Platform</strong>: Lists all the jobs and systems (dashboard, systems, and jobs) you have access to on the platform.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Documentation</strong>: Provides a list of resources to help you get started. Resources include how to set up your development environment and build/test/execute quantum circuits on quantum systems. It also provides API documentation of the latest version of the <strong class="keyWord">Quantum Information Science Kit</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Qiskit</strong>) open-source code.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Learning</strong>: Provides quantum courses and tutorials for users of all different levels. These cover topics such as the basics of quantum computing, variational algorithm design, and a new addition: quantum-safe cryptography!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">You can select and switch between each of these applications using the top-left applications icon next to your avatar, the switcher is shown in the following figure:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.1: Application selection</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter will help you understand what actions and information are available in each application, each of which we will also cover in more detail in later chapters, to give you an overview of where everything is. This includes creating circuits, running the circuits on both simulators and real quantum devices, viewing information about your profile and available backend systems, and visualizing the results of your experiments. So, let’s get started!</p>
    <p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Getting started with the IBM Quantum Platform</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using the documentation to quickly start up</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Understanding IBM quantum tools</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="heading-1">Technical requirements</h1>
    <p class="normal">Throughout this book, it is expected that you will have some experience in developing with Python and, although it isn’t necessary, some basic knowledge of classical and quantum mechanics would help. Most of the information will be provided with each chapter, so if you do not have knowledge of classical or quantum mechanics, we will cover what you need to know here. For those of you who have existing knowledge in this area, the information here will serve as a useful refresher.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Python editor used throughout this book is <strong class="keyWord">Jupyter Notebook</strong>. You can, of course, use any Python editor of your choice. This may include <strong class="keyWord">Watson Studio</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">PyCharm</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Spyder</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Visual Studio Code</strong>, and so on.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here is the source code used throughout this book: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Quantum-Computing-with-Python-and-IBM-Quantum-Second-Edition%0D%0A">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Quantum-Computing-with-Python-and-IBM-Quantum-Second-Edition</a></p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-17" class="heading-1">Getting started with the IBM Quantum Platform</h1>
    <p class="normal">As mentioned earlier, the IBM Quantum Platform<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> application is your high-level view of what you will normally see once you log in. It’s good to mention here that there may be updates to the tools as the platform evolves with the technology after the time of writing, so some visualizations and results may vary. The platform aggregates multiple views that you can see, and this helps you to get an idea as to what machines you have access to and what jobs you have pending, running, or completed.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will go through the steps to get registered. Let’s get started.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="heading-2">Registering to the IBM Quantum Platform</h2>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will get registered<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> and explain what happens in the background once you sign up to the IBM Quantum Platform for the first time. This will help you understand what features and configurations are prepared and available to you upon registration.</p>
    <p class="normal">To register, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">The first step<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> is to head over to the IBM Quantum Platform<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> site at the following link: <a href="https://quantum.ibm.com/%0D%0A">https://quantum.ibm.com/</a></li>
      <li class="numberedList">You should see the login screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.2</em>. Your individual situation will determine how to proceed from there:<ul>
          <li class="bulletList level-2">If you already have an account or are already signed in, you can sign in and skip this section.</li>
          <li class="bulletList level-2">If you have not registered, then you can select the login method of your choice from the sign-in screen. As you can see, you can register using various methods, such as with your <strong class="keyWord">IBMid</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Google</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">GitHub</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Twitter</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">LinkedIn</strong>, or by email.</li>
          <li class="bulletList level-2">If you do not have any of the account types listed, then you can simply register for an <strong class="screenText">IBMid</strong> account and use that to sign in:</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_02.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="540" height="590"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.2: The IBM Quantum Platform sign-in page</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Once you select the login method<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> of your choice, you will see the login screen for that method. Simply fill out the information, if it’s not already there, and select <strong class="screenText">login</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Once signed in, you will land on the IBM Quantum Platform home page. This is the first page you will see each time you log in:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_03.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="759" height="503"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: The IBM Quantum home page</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that you have registered with IBM Quantum Platform, let’s take a quick tour and delve into some features that make up the home page.</p>
    <p class="normal">Note first that across the top of the Platform application<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> page you have three tabs: <strong class="screenText">Dashboard</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Systems</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Jobs</strong>. Each of these provides various information for you, which we will cover in detail in the following sections. But before we get started, let’s look at the <strong class="screenText">Manage account</strong> settings view.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-19" class="heading-2">Understanding the Manage account settings view</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by reviewing<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> the home page, specifically the <strong class="screenText">Manage account </strong>settings view. You can access your user account and settings view via your avatar, located at the top right of the page (as visible in <em class="italic">Figure 1.3</em>).</p>
    <p class="normal">This view provides <strong class="screenText">profile settings</strong> of the logged-in user, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.4</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_04.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="825" height="409"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.4: The Manage account settings view</p>
    <p class="normal">This view also provides actions regarding your profile such as setting your password, email, API token, and in-app notification settings.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">The API token is used by the provider to determine which systems you have provisioned for your account. This is autogenerated when you use the platform; however, should you ever decide to run a notebook off the platform, then you will need to save your API token locally. We describe how to save and load your account details locally in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Programming with Qiskit and the Qiskit Runtime Service</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Below the <strong class="screenText">Manage account settings</strong> is the <strong class="screenText">Instances</strong> list, which allows<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> you to see which instances you are a member of. Instances are used to determine which IBM Quantum systems you have access to based on which hub, project, or group you belong to, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.4</em>. Also, below the list of instances is the option <strong class="screenText">Delete Account</strong>, which will also remove all your account data.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_05.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="825" height="473"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.5: Instances and Delete Account views</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, at the bottom<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> of the <strong class="screenText">Profile</strong> settings you will see your <strong class="screenText">Notification</strong> settings, which you can enable based on your preferences.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="heading-2">Getting familiar with the Compute resources view</h2>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Compute resources</strong> view provides you<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> with a list of all the various quantum services available to you, which include the quantum systems. You can see all the available services by selecting the grid icon, located at the top left of the IBM Quantum Platform view, and selecting the <strong class="screenText">Platform</strong> tab.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once the <strong class="screenText">Compute resources</strong> page is open you will see a grouping of systems via a pull-down selector highlighted by a box in the following figure. The groupings are of systems that you have access to and a list of all systems including those systems reserved for premium users, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.6</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_06.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="825" height="551"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.6: The Compute resources view</p>
    <p class="normal">The view contains all the systems available to you.</p>
    <p class="normal">Each card (or row if viewing in table mode) represents a different quantum<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> system available to you and details that describe each system. In the previous figure you can see it lists out detailed specifications. Systems with a lock icon next to them are those reserved for premium users such as those who are active members of the IBM Quantum Network.</p>
    <p class="normal">The details you can see for each system are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Qubits</strong>, which is the number of qubits available</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Error Per Layered Gate</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">EPLG</strong>), which is the latest metric used to measure the quality and performance of a quantum system</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Circuit layer operations per second</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CLOPS</strong>)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Status</strong>, which is the availability of the system (Online, Maintenance, etc.)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Total pending jobs</strong>, which is the number of jobs waiting to run on the system (queue)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Processor type</strong>, which is the type and version of the processor of the system</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">This information allows you to visualize all the systems and their metrics so you can select an ideal system to run your quantum circuits.</p>
    <p class="normal">The second selector is to view <strong class="screenText">All Instances</strong>; this lists all the quantum<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> systems that are available to you, including the open systems as well as premium quantum systems, if you are a quantum network member. To view the list as a table, rather than cards, you can select table view (located just above the system selector) as illustrated in<em class="italic"> Figure 1.7</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_07.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="825" height="499"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.7: A table view of all available systems – shows all available quantum systems, including premium systems</p>
    <p class="normal">In this view, same as the <strong class="keyWord">Your resources</strong> view, each row represents details about each quantum system’s properties<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> such as the status, processor type, number of qubits, quantum volume, and <strong class="keyWord">CLOPS</strong>.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">CLOPS is one of the measurements<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> that is used to determine the performance of a quantum computer. It measures the speed at which a quantum processor can execute layers of a circuit, similar to the parameterized model circuits used to measure the quantum volume of a quantum computer.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The names of the systems<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> do not represent the location of the device; the city names originated from where IBM Research has a lab and have since expanded to include cities where IBM has offices around the world. At the time of writing, the IBM Quantum systems reside in many locations around the world. The largest groups are located at the IBM Research Lab in Yorktown Heights and in Poughkeepsie, NY. There are now many on-prem systems in many locations, such as IBM Ehningen, Germany (via a partnership with Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft), and University of Tokyo. The first on-prem system that is not on an IBM site was recently installed in Cleveland Clinic, with many more scheduled to be installed in other countries such as Spain and South Korea.</p>
    <p class="normal">Above the rows you have a few features; one is a search window to help you find a specific system and next to that is a filter option, which allows you to narrow down the visible list of systems based on provider, status, or processor types. You can also see them as cards if you select the card selection on the top right of the table.</p>
    <p class="normal">To view further details of each quantum system, let’s select one of the systems; in this case I will select <strong class="screenText">ibm-brisbane</strong>, as seen in<em class="italic"> Figure 1.8</em>. Keep in mind that systems will continue to evolve and may be replaced after the time of writing this, so if a system is mentioned in this book that you do not see, don’t worry; just select any that you like as the details you see will vary per device.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_08.png" alt="" width="825" height="783"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.8: The device details view (truncated view of all 127 qubits)</p>
    <p class="normal">In this view you can examine<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> each system in more detail. Each quantum system has a set of properties that you have access to view. This helps greatly if there are some constraints or requirements to the type of system you wish to run your quantum programs on—for example, the connectivity between qubits, the error rate of each qubit and its physical connection, the basis gates, and other details that we will cover in detail in various chapters throughout this book.</p>
    <p class="normal">This view also allows you to download a CSV file that contains all these properties so you can analyze them using any analysis tools you wish. To download the properties, simply click on the download icon located below the <strong class="screenText">Last calibrated</strong> time in the <strong class="screenText">Calibration data</strong> section.</p>
    <p class="normal">You’ll also notice that there are two pull-down options available just above the qubit map of the system, where one has a set of options for <strong class="screenText">Qubit</strong> and another for the <strong class="screenText">Connection</strong> between the qubits. The options provide you with the ability to see what properties you wish to have rendered for each qubit and connection, respectively. In the qubit options you can select to see the details of each qubit, such as its frequency, T1/T2 times, anharmonicity, and readout assignment error. The connection options allow you to view the CNOT error and gate time (in nanoseconds) between each physically connected qubit.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">There are of course other ways to obtain these properties programmatically using Qiskit code, but we will get to that later in this book. For now, this is just for awareness, so in later chapters when you learn more about them, you’ll know where the information is located.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">We are now familiar <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>with the systems, and their details, on which we will run our quantum circuits; let’s see how we can view the results after the quantum systems have completed their job.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="heading-2">Learning about pending and latest jobs</h2>
    <p class="normal">When you send a circuit to run<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> on a simulator or a quantum system <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>you will want to know the status of the circuit. This is where the <strong class="screenText">Jobs</strong> view comes in handy. To get to the Jobs view, go back to the grid icon located at the top left of the dashboard and select <strong class="screenText">Jobs</strong> from the list of views. Once the view is open you will see a table, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.9</em>, that contains a complete list of jobs that are pending completion on either the simulators or backend devices. You can use this view to see the status of your circuit or program, the job ID, which provider and service were used, and other details for each job you submitted:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"> <img src="img/B18420_01_09.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="817" height="531"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.9: The Jobs view list</p>
    <p class="normal">The job ID is listed so that you can call back the details of that job later. Each job is initially sorted by creation date but can also be filtered by <strong class="screenText">Status</strong> (completed, pending, or returned), <strong class="screenText">Session Id</strong> (the unique ID for the session the job was run in), <strong class="screenText">Compute resource</strong> (which simulator or quantum system was used), or <strong class="screenText">Usage</strong> (time indicating how long the job took to run).</p>
    <div><p class="normal">Details regarding job objects will be covered in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Programming with Qiskit</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In this section, you have learned<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> where to find information<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> about your experiments, and hardware details about the quantum devices from the various views available on the IBM Quantum Platform. There are views that also provide you with the tools you need to start programming and running circuits on a quantum computer, in an easy-to-use format that does not include<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> any installation<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> of software.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next section we will review what the Documentation application provides you to help get started using the systems we just learned in this section.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-22" class="heading-1">Using the Documentation to quickly start up</h1>
    <p class="normal">Earlier in this chapter we covered<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> what systems you have access to and details about each system. In this section we will review the Documentation application, which will provide you with information and guidance on how to get yourself up and running and executing quantum circuits on a quantum computer.</p>
    <p class="normal">First, from the application selector, select the <strong class="screenText">Documentation</strong> application. This will open the <strong class="screenText">Documentation</strong> page as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.10</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_10.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="825" height="547"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.10: Documentation application view</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s look across the top of the page where you will see seven shortcuts each to help you get started. They are described as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Overview</strong>: The view that you see when you first get to the documentation page that has all the options</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Start</strong>: Directions on how to get your local system set up and install Qiskit</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Build</strong>: Instructions on how to design and develop your first quantum circuits</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Transpile</strong>: How to optimize the mapping of your circuit onto the selected device to ensure the highest quality and performance</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Verify</strong>: As the title indicates, how to test, verify, and evaluate your quantum circuits</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Run</strong>: Executing your tested quantum circuits on the quantum systems</li>
      <li class="bulletList">API reference: Quick links to key documentation on common objects and functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Below the <strong class="screenText">Get started with Qiskit</strong><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> and <strong class="keyWord">API</strong> <strong class="keyWord">Reference</strong> section of the page, you will also see the various tutorials available for those of you who already have your system set up and want to dive right into running quantum algorithms on a quantum computer. Each tile represents a different tutorial and they are independent of each other so you can pick whichever you’d like to get started on without worrying about any dependency on another tutorial.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that you know where to find the documentation needed to help you get up and running quickly, let’s continue and explore the tools you can use to generate quantum circuits using the IBM Quantum Composer.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-23" class="heading-1">Understanding the IBM Quantum tools</h1>
    <p class="normal">Understanding the systems<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> and knowing the status of our circuit jobs is great, but knowing how to create these circuits and run them is clearly an important step. In this section we will review both tools that are available to you. Using the application switcher, select the last application listed, <strong class="screenText">Learning</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following figure, <em class="italic">Figure 1.11</em> is the IBM Quantum Learning application view. This view provides you with a one-stop shop of resources. At first you will see that at the top, it highlights the latest course that was released. At the time of writing this, it was the <strong class="screenText">Fundamentals of quantum algorithms</strong>. Below that is the catalog of courses available to you on the platform with topics ranging from the basics of quantum information science to quantum-safe cryptography.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"> <img src="img/B18420_01_11.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="821" height="482"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.11: IBM Quantum Learning application view</p>
    <p class="normal">Below the courses<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> you will see three other sections. The first is the list of tutorials. This is the same list you saw in the previous section. It is duplicated in this section for completeness as it is of course the learning application. And at the bottom is the <strong class="screenText">Resources</strong> section, which lists other helpful learning resources, as illustrated in the following figure:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_12.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="825" height="384"/></figure>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18420_01_13.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" width="826" height="487"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.12: Courses, Tutorials, Tools, and Resources sections.</p>
    <p class="normal">We have two ways to launch<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> each tool. First, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.12</em>, you can launch each tool by clicking on it within the <strong class="screenText">Tools</strong> section. The second way is by selecting it from the top of the page as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.11</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Composer is a graphical UI where you can create your quantum circuits by dragging and dropping quantum gates onto a quantum circuit. The Composer also provides various visual representations of the results such as the state of the circuit and the expected probability measurements. This makes the Composer a fantastic tool to help you get a visual, and perhaps intuitive, understanding of how the various quantum gates and properties affect the results of both the qubit itself and the overall quantum state. This is a tool I highly recommend you start with as it contains some very nice introductory tutorials that you can follow to create your first quantum circuit and run it on an actual quantum computer. We will create<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> a simple circuit and run it on a quantum computer in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Creating Quantum Circuits with IBM Quantum Composer</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we are done with our tour of the IBM Quantum tools, we’re ready to get to work. In the following chapters, we will delve further into the Composer and progress to writing quantum programs.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-24" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we reviewed the IBM Quantum Platform, which provides plenty of information to help you get a good lay of the land. You now know where to find information regarding your profile, details for each of the devices you have available, the status of each device, as well as the status and results of your experiments. Some views might look a little different based on the level of provider you have. I have chosen to use the free open provider throughout this book so all users can see the general views. If you are a premium or partner user, then your views may have more information or options that are specific to your provider. Details about those differences are outside the scope of this book; however, you can check with your IBM Quantum representative for details about the additional views and roles.</p>
    <p class="normal">Knowing where to find this information will help you monitor your experiments and enable you to understand the state of your experiments by reviewing your backend services, monitoring queue times, and viewing your results queues.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will learn about the Composer in detail and run our very first quantum circuit.</p>
