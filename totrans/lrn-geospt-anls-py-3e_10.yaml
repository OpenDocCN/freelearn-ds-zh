- en: This section is of an advanced level and it will require all of the skills you
    learned previously. It starts off with learning how to create geospatial models
    to answer specific questions. Further, it will show you a few techniques for building
    geospatial models and how it will help to predict the future using visualization
    concepts. We'll move on to accessing and processing real-time data. At the end
    of this section, we'll combine all that we learned in the previous sections and
    implement a system to create an outdoor running or hiking report based on GPS
    data and geotagged photos.
