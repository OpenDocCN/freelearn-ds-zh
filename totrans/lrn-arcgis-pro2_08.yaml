    using ArcGIS Pro. While these are impressive, they are not complete. The last
    step to producing any map is to put it in a frame with other information, which
    helps the viewer comprehend the information you are presenting. This frame is
    called a **layout**.

    a scale, and a title, in addition to one or more map frames. The need to include
    various elements in your layout will depend on the story that you are trying to
    impart to the viewers. Before you create your layout, you need to take some time

    how to get from one location to another. The purpose of a map or layout defines
    the overall theme of that map. It also helps determine what content needs to be

    of your layout. If you are creating a zoning map, you will certainly need a map
    frame that shows the zoning classification of each parcel. You will also need
    a legend that allows the map viewers to understand the different classifications.
    If this is the official zoning map for the city, you may also need to add places
    for city officials to sign the map and the date of adoption.

    bigger to make it easier to read. This may mean you cannot put too much detail
    into a single map to avoid over-cluttering it, which might also mean you need
    to create multiple maps for this audience. Age may also impact the choice of symbology
    styles you use. If you are making a map for a very young audience, you might want
    simple, brightly colored symbols, for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the greatest impact. Younger audiences tend to prefer digital media to printed
    maps, while older audiences tend to prefer printed maps to digital media.

    impact on your map and layout design. For example, if you are creating a map of

    of detail. They will want to know the pipe sizes, flow direction, treatment capacities,
    and more.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may wonder why you would design a map differently if you are going to print
    it versus publish it digitally. Well, the simple answer is that each has its own
    limitations. When printing a map, you are limited by the capabilities of your
    printer. *Is it color or just black and white?* *What sizes will it print?* *How
    much memory does it have?* It does little good to design a colored 36 inch by
    48 inch map with aerial photography if all you have is a small desktop color printer
    that has only a couple megabytes of memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your map will overwhelm a printer like this. Another thing you need to consider
    when printing maps is paper quality, especially if you're using an inkjet-style
    printer. The quality of the paper you use in an inkjet printer has a big impact
    on the quality of your final output and even what you can print. Low-grade, 20
    lbs bond paper will not produce a high-quality map. It will also not do well with
    a map that has a large amount of fill or aerial photos. The paper just cannot
    absorb the amount of ink that is applied, so it will become wrinkled and rip very
    easily. It might even damage your printer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several options that you have for publishing a map digitally. You
    can publish it in a `.pdf` file. This allows people without GIS software to view
    your creation on a wealth of devices and even add the map to a website without
    the need for special GIS web servers. `.pdf` files can also be secured, requiring
    a password to open them. Current versions of the **Portable Document Format**
    (**PDF**) format even support layers and attribute data. This allows you to create
    an interactive map, even for those without GIS software. When creating a PDF,
    you must consider the file size. The more you include in a map and the higher
    the resolution, the larger the PDF becomes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also publish your maps to **ArcGIS Online** or **ArcGIS Enterprise**.
    These allow even greater levels of access and functionality. However, these are
    web-based technologies, so you must always be concerned about performance when
    you are designing a map that will be published in this manner. Simpler is always
    better. You will need to avoid complex symbology and labels wherever possible.
    Reducing the number of layers also helps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another popular way to present a map digitally is by using a projector. This
    is especially common when presenting the map at a meeting. Projectors tend to
    wash or fade colors, however, so you may need to choose a more intense color palette
    for your map if you intend to project it. Also, remember that projectors will
    impact the scale of your map. Even though you might set the map to one scale in
    ArcGIS Pro, the projected image will not always be on that same scale.

    new blank layout to your project, or you can import an existing map document file
