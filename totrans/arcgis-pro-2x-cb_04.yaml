    is removed, regulations change, new needs are discovered, and so on. Our GIS must
    be able to keep up with these changes so that it accurately reflects the world
    we live in as closely as possible. This means we must be able to quickly and easily
    make changes to our GIS data, both spatial and tabular.

    to your data. The tools available to you and the types of data you can edit or

    only have a Basic license, you are not able to edit data in an SDE geodatabase.
    However, you can edit a shapefile or feature classes in a file geodatabase. Here
    is a quick list of the data formats you can edit and at which license level:'

    never will. Esri has decided to replace the personal geodatabase with the file
    geodatabase because it provides much better performance. ArcGIS Pro Basic will
    allow you to edit data stored in a file geodatabase as long as it is not part
    of a topology or geometric network.

    ArcGIS Pro 2.1 does support the newer Utility Network which was just released
    in its initial version in December 2017\. The Utility Network provides similar
    functionality to the Geometric Network but is designed to be used in conjunction
    with the Utility Network Management extension for ArcGIS Enterprise. So it appears
    that the Utility Network will completely replace the older Geometric Network model.
    You can learn more about the Utility Network and the Management extension by going
    to [https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-utility-network-management/overview](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-utility-network-management/overview).

    Geodatabase either. SDE stands for Spatial Database Engine and provides multiple

    Enterprise (formerly known as ArcGIS Server). With a Basic license, you can only
    view data in an SDE Geodatabase but not edit it. For more information about the
    different types of geodatabases, go to [http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geodatabases/types-of-geodatabases.htm](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geodatabases/types-of-geodatabases.htm).

- en: When editing, you need to ensure you save your edits frequently to avoid losing
    work if your computer crashes, locks up, or loses power. Unlike other applications,
    ArcGIS Pro does not create a restorable copy of your edits. The only way to ensure
    your edits are persistent is to save them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is ArcGIS Pro never really works directly with the data
    you see in a map or table. Instead, ArcGIS Pro determines what features are visible
    and loads those into your computer memory. This will change as you move within
    a map or table. This allows ArcGIS to work with large datasets which would cause
    other applications to slow or crash. You never open or load the entire database
    at one time. You only see what you need. This also means your edits are only stored
    in your computer’s memory. They are not actually committed back to the source
    data until you save your edits. **So make sure to save often!**

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you reshaped the City Limits boundary for the City of Trippville
    so that it included a newly annexed parcel. The first thing you needed to do in
    order to perform this edit was to set which layer you wanted to have as selectable
    and editable. You did this through the lists in the Contents tab.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When editing data, remember that data can be selectable but not editable, editable
    but not selectable, both, or neither. If you need to edit a feature by first selecting
    it from the map, as you did in this recipe, you need the layer to be both selectable
    and editable. If you select the feature for editing using an Attribute query,
    the layer does not need to be selectable. Setting a layer as selectable in the
    Contents pane only applies when performing an interactive selection in the map.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the Trace tool allowed you to edit the City Limit boundary so that it
    followed the parcel boundary exactly. The Trace tool automatically copies the
    geometry of the feature you are tracing to the new shape so it is an exact duplicate.
    This ensures your data is clean and accurate. It reduces errors such as overlaps
    and gaps which can impact the results of analysis and measurements.

- en: Polygons are not the only type of feature you may need to split. Lines often
    need to be split as you add other features to the same layer to maintain the correct
    connections. Lines often form a network used to travel across, such as roads,
    railroads, sidewalks, and trails. Travel is not limited to transportation. Utilities
    also use linear features to move water, sewer, electricity, and communications
    from one point to another. Other systems such as emergency dispatch systems rely
    on linear data from GIS as well. So, it is extremely important that we maintain
    these layers correctly.
  prefs: []

    segment. This simplifies the layer by reducing the total number of features, which

    existing features or create a new feature while leaving the existing features
    in place. This option is accessed by clicking on one of the two tabs located at
    the top of the tool, Existing Feature or New Feature. The Existing Feature option
    replaces the selected features with a new feature that has the attributes of one
    of the selected features. The New Feature option creates a brand new feature and
    leaves the selected features in place as well. You can merge any type of feature
    as long as the features are in the same layer.

    Quadrant Bearings divide the compass into four quadrants, north-east, south-east,
    south-west, and north-west. Then, the direction within that quadrant is measured
    based on the angle from either due north or due south to a maximum of 90 degrees.
    So, a feature heading directly due east could be identified as either north 90
    east or south 90 east.  Typically, the measurements are shown using degrees, minutes,
    and seconds as opposed to decimal degrees. In the example used in this recipe,
    47 is the degrees, 6 is the minutes, and 50 is the seconds within the north-west
    quadrant.

    now time to learn how to create polygon features. Polygons are very similar to
    polylines in that they consist of multiple vertices. The big difference is that
    a polygon must form a closed figure and a polyline does not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A polygon is constructed with a minimum of four vertices. This may seem confusing,
    as a triangle is a polygon but only has three sides. So why are four vertices
    required? Well, that is because the polygon must be closed. So, the first and
    last vertices are in the exact same location. When creating new polygons in ArcGIS
    Pro, the software automatically does this. So, you never have to worry about whether
    your polygon is closed or not.

- en: When creating polygons that represent features such as parcels, political boundaries,
    emergency response boundaries, and others, it is important to create them in such
    a way to ensure they do not have overlaps and gaps. The Autocomplete tool is a
    great way to ensure the new polygons you create follow existing boundaries exactly.
    This means they do not have gaps or overlaps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you created a new parcel polygon by defining three of four sides
    using traditional methods you learned in other recipes in this chapter. The fourth
    side was automatically created because the Autocomplete tool traces the boundary
    of the adjoining existing parcel automatically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using the Autocomplete tool, you need to ensure the sketch you create starts
    and ends by touching or crossing the boundary of the existing adjacent polygon.
    If your sketch does not touch or cross the existing adjacent boundary, the tool

    simple change. You will change the material of the sewer lines you added in a

    of each road segment in miles.

    new values for all records in the table based on the value or expression you inputted
    into the tool. In this recipe, you had four sewer lines selected, so only those
    four had their material values changed. If you had not selected those four and
    had run the Calculate Field tool, it would have changed the material value for
    all the sewer lines in the layer to DI.
