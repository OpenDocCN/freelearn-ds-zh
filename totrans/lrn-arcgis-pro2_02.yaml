- en: Esri's ArcGIS platform has become well-entrenched as the primary solution for
    GIS professionals seeking to implement a scalable integrated solution, which can
    start with a single user and grow to support multiple users across various platforms.
    With **ArcGIS Desktop**, **ArcGIS Enterprise**, **ArcGIS Online**, and **ArcGIS
    Apps**, **Geographic Information System** (**GIS**) professionals can design and
    implement a robust GIS solution that provides a wide range of functionality to
    meet the needs of a growing enterprise, which includes users of various skill
    levels, requirements, differing platforms, and data formats. However, Esri has
    not been content to rest on their laurels. They continue to push the GIS envelope.

- en: In 2015, Esri released a new desktop GIS application named ArcGIS Pro. ArcGIS
    Pro has replaced ArcMap and ArcCatalog as the flagship desktop GIS application
    in Esri's solution stack. Those are not the only applications ArcGIS Pro has replaced.
    It has also replaced the ArcScene and ArcGlobe applications for 3D data viewing
    and analysis.

- en: ArcGIS Pro is a completely new application from Esri. It is not just an update
    to their venerable ArcGIS Desktop platform. ArcGIS Pro has a modern ribbon interface
    that has become common in most current desktop applications. It is also designed
    from the ground up to take full advantage of modern hyperthreaded 64-bit architecture.
    This greatly improves its performance compared to the older applications it is
    replacing. In this chapter, we will begin to take a look at this new robust and
    smart interface.

- en: ArcGIS Pro also introduces a new licensing model to Esri users. While it still
    supports the traditional Single Use and **Concurrent Use** license models of previous
    applications, at least for now, it defaults to the use of a subscription-based
    named user license model. This new license model requires you to manage your licenses
    through ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise Portal. You will learn more about this
    later in the chapter.

    In the past, you would need to utilize multiple applications, such as **ArcMap**,
    **ArcScene**, and **ArcGlobe**, to view 2D and 3D content. In this chapter, you
    will examine how you can view both 2D and 3D data within a single ArcGIS Pro project.

    such as the **Intel Core i7** or **AMD Ryzen** and **Random Access Memory** (**RAM**)
    larger than 4 GB. The ability of ArcGIS Pro to make use of this increased computing
    capability means it typically completes tasks much faster than the older applications

    Compared with the older ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Pro has much higher minimum computer

    supporting application requirements. This means that just because your current
    computer is able to run applications such as ArcMap, it will not necessarily be
    able to successfully run ArcGIS Pro. It is important to verify that your computer

    systems, but neither Esri nor Microsoft will provide you with support if you encounter
    any problems. It also means that neither company will be providing patches or

    **Graphics Processing Unit** (**GPU**) and **Dedicated Video RAM** (**VRAM**).
    ArcGIS Pro is a graphics-intensive program. Every time you pan, zoom, or add a
    new layer, you will be taxing the graphics capability of your computer. A video
    card will allow your computer to handle this load by processing graphics rendering
    requests without burdening your computer's CPU and system RAM. If your computer
    uses integrated video, then the computer's CPU and system RAM are used to handle
    all processing requests, including graphics rendering.
  prefs:

- en: ArcGIS Pro is both a processor and graphics-intensive application due to the
    2D and 3D maps it creates and the analysis it performs. This can put a tremendous
    load on your computer's resources. Having the dedicated GPU to handle the graphics
    rendering load on your computer will greatly improve the performance of ArcGIS
    Pro and your user experience.

    good success using video cards with **NVIDIA** GPUs. Currently, I am running a
    **GeForce RTX 2070 Super**. It has performed very well and is not too expensive,
    being around $550 at the time of writing this book. AMD video cards have been
    a bit lackluster until the recent release of their new **Radeon RX 5700 series**.
    This new card from AMD has been matching or beating NVDIA's performance in most
    benchmarks, so this might be worth trying as well, especially since it is a little
    less expensive for the same (or better) overall performance.

    and storing data. They are almost as fast as RAM and are much faster than even
    the fastest hard disk drives. ArcGIS Pro will run at lightning speeds when installed
    on a solid-state drive. This is even truer if you can get a **Non-Volatile Memory
    Express** (**NVMe**) **M.2 PCIe drive**. These are small drives that look more
    like a memory stick than a hard drive, but have much greater performance than
    even traditional **Serial Advanced Technology Attachment** (**SATA**) solid-state
    drives. This is what I am using in my current workstation.

    of RAM. However, if you are working primarily with vector data in mostly a 2D
    environment, 16 GB of RAM appears to be the optimum spot between performance and

    drive, try using a **Redundant Array of Independent Disks** (**RAID**) system
    to improve performance. RAID systems utilize multiple hard drives to store data.
    They can be configured in multiple ways. A strip set-based RAID, such as **RAID
    0**, **RAID 3**, or **RAID 5**, provides the best performance.

- en: By storing the data across multiple drives, the computer can access the requested
    data from each one at the same time. This creates a multilane highway for your
    data to travel along. A RAID system will require at least two hard drives and
    often a separate controller card. Multiple solid-state drives can also be put
    into a RAID for increased performance if desired. However, for all but the largest
    datasets, I would say that would be overkill in most cases.

    Use licenses or Concurrent Use licenses. ArcGIS Pro supports those in addition
    to Named User licensing. This allows you to pick the licensing method that best

    form of license or use authorization for software until recently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Concurrent Use licensing is often referred to as a network license. This type
    of license requires a license server to be set up and configured. It acts as a
    librarian for your software licenses. When a user starts the application, it first
    checks with the license server or manager to see whether one is available. If
    there is an available license, one is checked out to the user, and the application
    starts. If all licenses are in use, the user gets an error indicating all licenses
    are in use and the application will not start.

    you wish, but only the number of users equal to the number of licenses your organization
    has are able to be running the application at any given time. Esri is slowly eliminating
    this licensing method in favor of Single Use and Named User methods. If you or
    your organization is using Concurrent Use licensing, it is recommended you start
    looking into migrating to one of the other two as you implement ArcGIS Pro.

    to the licensing used by **Adobe Creative Cloud** and **Microsoft Office 365**.
    You manage these licenses through ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. This method
    assigns an ArcGIS Pro license to individual user logins that are part of your
    ArcGIS Online organizational account or Portal for ArcGIS. Because this is the
    default licensing method for ArcGIS Pro, we will show you how to assign licenses
    to your users in ArcGIS Online. The same basic method will also work if you are

- en: You have now successfully installed and started to use ArcGIS Pro. So you now
    have the skills to install and get working with ArcGIS Pro. This new 64-bit hyperthreaded
    application from Esri provides an effective tool to visualize a range of data,
    including 2D and 3D. This increased capability does require a greater amount of
    system resources to run effectively compared with the earlier ArcGIS applications.

    model, Named Users, in addition to a traditional Single Use or concurrent license.
    You also learned that ArcGIS Pro Named User licenses are managed through your
    organization's ArcGIS Online account or Portal for ArcGIS. It was also pointed
    out that only users in your organization that are creators or professional user
    types may be assigned an ArcGIS Pro license.

    the skills to deal with projects that may contain multiple items, including 2D
    and 3D maps, but that is just the beginning, as you will learn in later chapters.
    Once you opened the project, you used the Explore tool to navigate within a map
    and retrieve information about the features you see.
