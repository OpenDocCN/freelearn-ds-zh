			<p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter builds on the basic charts you created in <em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring Comparison and Composition</em>. You will also cover the advanced topics of trend and reference lines, and will see some examples of where they are frequently used. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create charts for distributions, show relationships across data points, and create advanced chart types such as <strong class="bold">Dual Axis</strong> and <strong class="bold">Quadrant</strong> charts. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In previous chapters, you have learned about various charting methods that are reliant upon having both dimensions and measures in the view. However, there may be times, especially in business scenarios, where you only have measures to work with. In this chapter, you will learn how to create charts without dimensions, and also charts with multiple measures. You will learn to create relationships between measures, and will see how advanced Tableau skills like trend and reference lines can help better demonstrate insights to stakeholders.</p>
			<p>First, you will explore distribution for a single measure using histograms,  box plots, and whisker plots. Then, you will look at distributions across two measures using scatter plots, and scatter plots with trend lines (linear, logarithmic, and exponential). You will then look at advanced visualizations such as dual axis and quadrant charts for multiple dimensions/measures.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Exploring Distribution for a Single Measure</h1>
			<p>Distribution charts such as histograms and box plots are used to  show the distribution of continuous and numerical quantitative data. However, bar charts, as discussed in the previous chapter, are used when plotting discrete and categorical data. In these sections, you will focus on discrete and categorical chart types.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Creating a Histogram</h2>
			<p>A histogram  represents frequency distribution.   It shows the distribution of values and can help identify any outliers. Histograms take your continuous measures and splits the range of  measurements. They are placed into buckets known as bins. Each bin is essentially a bar in a histogram representing the count of that range of values falling within that bin. </p>
			<p>If you were to create a histogram of the salary of all the employees in a company, where the range of each bin is $10,000, your histogram would represent how many employees are earning $0-10,000, $10,001-20,000, $20,001-30,000, and so on.</p>
			<p>It is straightforward to create a histogram in Tableau, as it is one of the 24 default chart types in  the <strong class="source-inline">Show Me</strong> pane. Whenever you create a histogram in Tableau, bins/buckets of equal size are created, and Tableau creates a bin dimension (a local temporary dimension created for your bin ranges) for the measure you used while creating the chart. </p>
			<p>The following figure shows a sample histogram. Here, you are looking at the distribution of the count of total order quantities with a bin size of 1. Essentially, from the following histogram, you can see that there were <strong class="source-inline">899</strong> orders with only 1 item, there were <strong class="source-inline">2,402</strong> orders with <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> items, and so on:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2: Histogram option as a part of the Show Me pane</p>
			<p>While creating the histogram, Tableau automatically adds the <strong class="source-inline">Quantity (bin)</strong> dimension in the <strong class="source-inline">Data</strong> pane, as shown here:</p>

				<div id="_idContainer359" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>Now work through this Exercise 5.01 and see in practice how to create a histogram.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Exercise 5.01: Creating a Histogram</h2>
			<p>As an analyst of an e-commerce store, your manager is looking to better understand the size of each order by asking you to create a chart that shows the count of orders by the quantity of orders. One of the better ways to represent frequency distribution is using histograms. In this exercise, you will use the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset to create a view of <strong class="source-inline">Counts of Orders by Quantity</strong> distribution and in the process, learn the exact steps to create a histogram in Tableau.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can find the <strong class="source-inline">Sample - Superstore</strong> dataset at the following link: <a href="https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls?language=en_US">https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls?language=en_US</a>.</p>
			<p class="callout">Alternatively, you can also find the dataset in our GitHub repository here: <a href="https://packt.link/21LCj">https://packt.link/21LCj</a>.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Dataset Description</strong>: The <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset is a dataset that comes loaded with Tableau Desktop by default. The dataset represents a fictional store that contains dimensions of orders such as <strong class="source-inline">Order Dates</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Ship Date</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Country</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Product Category</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">Sub-category</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">Manufacturer</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">Name</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Customer Name</strong>, as well as measures such as <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Quantity</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> numbers.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load the <strong class="source-inline">Orders</strong> table from <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.<div id="_idContainer360" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16342_05_04.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4: Loading the Sample – Superstore dataset&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4: Loading the Sample – Superstore dataset</p>
			<p>As mentioned, a histogram is used for continuous and numerical data, so in this case, you have <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Quantity</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong>. In this example, you will use <strong class="source-inline">Quantity</strong> to create the histogram.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Double-click on <strong class="source-inline">Quantity</strong> or drag the <strong class="source-inline">Quantity</strong> measure to the <strong class="source-inline">Rows</strong> shelf. By default, Tableau selects horizontal bars as the preferred chart method, as seen here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer361" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5: A single bar for the total sales</p>
			<p>As you see, there are only two chart options for the <strong class="source-inline">Quantity</strong> measure available in the <strong class="source-inline">Show Me</strong> panel.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Select <strong class="source-inline">Histogram</strong> and you will get with the following view:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6: Histogram bin default by Tableau</p>
			<p>As you see, Tableau has now created a Quantity (bin) dimension in the Data pane and has automatically decided the best bin size for the data. In your current view, it is unclear whether the first bin ends at <strong class="source-inline">1.5</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">2.0</strong>. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">For better readability, edit the bin sizes to be integers. Right-click on <strong class="source-inline">Quantity (bin)</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">Data</strong> pane and select <strong class="source-inline">Edit...</strong>:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7: Editing bin sizes</p>
			<p>In the Edit Bins [Quantity] window, the bin size is <strong class="source-inline">1.77</strong> for this dataset, which is less than <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, making it unclear where our first bin ended. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Change the bin size to an integer value (in this case, to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> for readability). This will show your end user how many orders included only one item in the invoice, two items, and so on:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8: Changing bin sizes</p>
			<p>Next, you will make some formatting changes. As you can see, the x axis starts from zero and ends at one bin past the maximum bin. Edit this to start the x axis from one and go up to the maximum bin size so that you have one continuous axis. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">To edit the axis, right-click on the <em class="italic">x</em> axis and click on <strong class="source-inline">Edit Axis</strong>. Next, select <strong class="source-inline">Fixed</strong> range from the <strong class="source-inline">Edit Axis</strong> window, enter <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> for <strong class="source-inline">Fixed start</strong> and keep <strong class="source-inline">Fixed end</strong> as it is, as shown here:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10: Final histogram</p>
			<p>You have learned how to use frequency distribution to create histograms, and have answered the following question: <em class="italic">How many sales/orders included one item, two items, and so on</em>?</p>
			<p>In the preceding screenshot, the histogram represents the count of orders with one item, two items, and so on. There are <strong class="source-inline">1,230</strong> orders with <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> items and <strong class="source-inline">572</strong> orders with <strong class="source-inline">6</strong> items. </p>
			<p>Next, you will learn about the importance of <strong class="bold">Box and Whisker</strong> (<strong class="bold">B&amp;W</strong>) plots and when to use them in your charts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Box and Whisker Plots</h2>
			<p>Whenever you want to illustrate distributions, apart from histograms, B&amp;W plots are one of the other options you have. Box plots work really well when you want to compare two dimensions side by side where one of the dimensions is on the <em class="italic">x</em> axis and the other is on the <em class="italic">y</em> axis. For example, the batting average of hitters in major league baseball. Before learning to create B&amp;W plots (also called box plots), it is important to understand their importance, how to read them, and when it’s best to use them.</p>
			<p>Here is what a B&amp;W plot looks like:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer367" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_11.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11: Sample B&amp;W plot&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11: Sample B&amp;W plot</p>
			<p>The box part of the image represents the first and third quartiles, also known as the <strong class="bold">Interquartile Range</strong> (<strong class="bold">IQR</strong>). The IQR is calculated as Q3 minus Q1 (Q3-Q1). The whiskers on the left and right represent the lowest value of the first quartile and the highest value of the fourth quartile respectively. The middle line in the box is the median (Q2), which is the middle number of the dataset. Data points to the left of the line are the numbers less than the median, whereas to the right side are all the numbers greater than the median. Next, you will start creating box plots with the superstore dataset. </p>
			<p>B&amp;W plots are particularly useful when you want your distribution to identify outliers. For example, the next screenshot shows the age distribution of two counties: the County of Philly and the County of Morago. The top plot represents Philly, the bottom Morago. The IQR for Philly is between 23 and 64, and for Morago is 15 and 43. But the screenshot also helps identify the outliers, as there is a section of the population in both counties with humans aged 100 and above. That is where B&amp;W plots can be so useful.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Exercise 5.02: Creating a Box and Whisker Plot without the Show Me Panel</h2>
			<p>Like a histogram, a B&amp;W plot is part of the <strong class="source-inline">Show Me</strong> pane in Tableau, but in this case, you will learn how to create box plots using reference lines. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">Orders</strong> table from <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a bar chart with one dimension and one measure (bar charts were discussed in <em class="italic">Chapter 4: Data Exploration: Comparison and Composition</em>). Select <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong> as the measure and the product <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong> as the dimension (looking at <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong> by <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong>).</li>
				<li>Drag <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Columns</strong> shelf and <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Rows</strong> shelf as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="4">Add the distribution dimension to the <strong class="source-inline">Detail</strong> <strong class="source-inline">Marks</strong> card. In this case, you are looking at <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong> distributed by <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong>, by year of order.

			<p>IQR, as mentioned previously, stands for interquartile range, which is all the data points between the first and third quartiles. In the <strong class="source-inline">Box</strong> Plot dialog option box, <strong class="source-inline">Data within 1.5 times the IQR</strong> essentially means we are asking Tableau to make all data points on the plot fit within 1.5 times the IQR. Any data point outside the range will be considered an outlier. You will  explore this concept with your actual plot in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer375" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.19: B&amp;W plot for profit by segment</p>
			<p>The middle line in the box plot, the intersection of light and dark gray, is the median. If you look across the view, you can quickly compare the medians of all the product segments irrespective of how big or small the median is. The upper whisker is 50% higher than the IQR and the lower whisker is 50% lower than the IQR. If data points are outside the box and whisker, those data points are considered outliers and this chart allows you to quickly identify them, which isn’t so straightforward in histograms.</p>
			<p>Next, you will see how to create a box plot using the <strong class="source-inline">Show Me</strong> panel, a more straightforward method.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Exercise 5.03: Box Plot Using the Show Me Panel</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will create a box plot from the <strong class="source-inline">Show me </strong>panel. You will be continuing on from where you left off in the previous exercise, but you may use a new sheet.</p>

			<p>Consider the median (the middle line in the box plot) of the preceding screenshot. If you look across the view, you can quickly compare the medians of all the product segments irrespective of how big or small the median is. If a data point is outside the B&amp;W, those data points are considered outliers. </p>
			<p>Box plots can be incredibly powerful when the right data is in place. A box plot conveys a lot of information in a single chart.</p>
			<p>This wraps up the histogram, box, and whisker plot activity using single measures. Next, you will explore scatter plots, which are useful when dealing with two or more measures.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Relationship and Distribution with Multiple Measures</h1>
			<p>In this part of the chapter, you will explore how to best represent two measures in the same view and how these charts can help build the relationship between two or more measures. You will initially  look at scatter plots. Once you cover the distribution part of these multiple-measure charts, you will move on to the relationship between these measures by discussing dual axis charts and their uses.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Distribution with Two Measures</h2>
			<p>Scatter plots are two-dimensional graphs created with two to four measures and zero or more dimensions. The first two measures are used as the <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> axis, and the third and fourth measures, as well as the dimensions, are used for adding more formatting and context to the scatter marks. </p>
			<p>Scatter plots are useful when plotting two quantifiable measures against one and other. This could be Sales versus Profit or Quantity versus Discount, for example. Scatter plots also help find patterns or clusters, which  aids in decision making,  by identifying outliers and groups of points that are related. </p>
			<p>If you want to go a level deeper, you can also add reference lines to these plots, which can split the scatter plots into four quadrants (we will walk through an exercise later in the chapter explaining how to create a four-quadrant view). This makes it easier for the end user to call out the relationship.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Creating a Scatter Plot</h2>
			<p>You will now create a scatter plot in Tableau. When doing this, one measure becomes the <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> axis and the second measure becomes the <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> axis. By default, when you plot two measures in your view, Tableau aggregates these measures to a single dot in the view. You then have to manually de-aggregate (make the more granular) the measure to create the scatter plot (as shown in the following screenshot). </p>
			<p>Here is the final version of the scatter plot, which you will create with two measures and two dimensions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer378" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.22: Sample scatter plot of Sales versus Profit for each sub-category</p>
			<p>The following Exercise 5.04 will outline the steps to this in detail. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Exercise 5.04: Creating a Scatter Plot</h2>
			<p>The manager of your store requests a report looking at total sales versus profit for each sub-category sold in the store.  The chart must identify each sub-category, using color to represent the overarching category each subcategory belongs to. You will be using the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset to fulfill the request.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete the exercise:</p>

				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">Orders</strong> table from <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance (if its not already open in your Tableau instance).</li>
				<li>Select two measures for plotting data points. For this exercise,  these are <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong>.</li>

			<p>As soon as you drag the second measure to the <strong class="source-inline">Rows</strong> shelf, you get a plot with only one dot in the view. By default, Tableau aggregates all measures whenever they are dragged from the <strong class="source-inline">Data</strong> pane to the shelf. The point here represents the intersection of <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> versus Profits for all records in the dataset. You have to specify the level of detail for the plot by de-aggregating the measures.</p>

			<p><em class="italic">Figure 5.27</em> clearly shows that the <strong class="source-inline">Tables</strong> sub-category brought in roughly $200K in sales, but was a loss-making sub-category, since <strong class="source-inline">Tables</strong> sales shows a loss of about $20K. <strong class="source-inline">Copiers</strong>  on the other hand, shows sales of $150K and profits over $50K. </p>
			<p>Considering how easy it is to observe these insights, scatter plots can be an incredible tool for plotting two measures against one and other. By adding more visual elements, it can transform into a powerful visual chart that is easily understandable as well as reasonably easy to create. </p>
			<p>This wraps up scatter plots with two measures and two dimensions. Next, you will explore trend lines, and the options we have available in Tableau.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Scatter Plots with Trend Lines</h1>
			<p>In this section, rather than focusing on the math that <strong class="bold">trend lines</strong> are dependent on, you will look at them from an analyst/data developer perspective, and will see some common use cases in business. </p>
			<p>Trend lines are used to observe relationships between variables. For example, they could be used to see the relationship between force and acceleration, or to track the relationship between sales and profits over a given time period. They are statistical models that are useful in estimating future patterns or trends based on historical data points.</p>
			<p>Adding trend lines in Tableau is fairly simple. In this section, you will explore the variations of trend lines available. <em class="italic">Figure 5.27</em> shows the five types of a trend line in Tableau. You will get a thorough definition of each as well as their most common applications a little later in this section.</p>

			<p>In this exercise, you learned ways to add a trend line to the view. Next, you will explore each trend line in greater detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Trend Lines and Types</h2>
			<p>As previously covered, trend lines  help to show the overall trend in the view. They can also be used to predict the continuation of a trend in data. Additionally, they help to identify the correlation between two variables by analyzing the underlying trend.</p>
			<p>You will now explore each of the five trend lines that Tableau has to offer, how they differ from each other, and when to use them.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Linear Trend Lines</h3>
			<p>When estimating the linear relationship between independent as well as dependent variables (for example, the exchange rate between US dollars and others currencies), linear trend lines are the best-fit lines. Linear trend lines help to estimate variables that are steadily increasing or decreasing. The formula for a linear trend line is as follows: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer389" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_33.jpg" alt="Figure 5.33: Linear trend line formula&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.33: Linear trend line formula</p>
			<p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">Y</strong> is the dependent variable, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is the independent variable, which affects the dependent variable. <strong class="source-inline">m</strong> is the slope of the trend line, and <strong class="source-inline">c</strong> is the constant (<strong class="source-inline">y</strong>-intercept).</p>
			<p>In a linear model, it is assumed that as one of the variables increases, the rate of increase/decrease for the second variable will increase/decrease at a constant rate too. More often, the variables will fall close to the trend line plotted by the model. The following figure shows an example of a linear trend line:</p>
			<div>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Polynomial Trend Lines</h3>
			<p>Polynomial, as the word suggests, means <em class="italic">multiple items</em>, and is best when there are a lot of fluctuations in your data. For example, it might be used when analyzing the gains and losses of stocks over a large dataset. The degree/order of a polynomial trend line is useful for determining the number of fluctuations or hills/bends in our data. The formula for a polynomial trend line is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer391" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_35.jpg" alt="Figure 5.35: Polynomial trend lines formula&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.35: Polynomial trend lines formula</p>
			<p>Here, <em class="italic">Y</em> is the dependent variable, <em class="italic">x</em> is the independent variable, which affects the dependent variable; <em class="italic">m</em> is the slope at a point, and <em class="italic">c</em> is the constant.</p>
			<p>The following figure shows an example of a scatter plot with a polynomial trend line:</p>
			<div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.36: Polynomial trend line showcase</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Polynomial Degree of Freedom</h3>
			<p>In the following screenshot, the degree of freedom for the polynomial trend line is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, which means that, after analyzing the dataset, Tableau decided that the data should have three bends/hills depending on the fluctuations. A degree of <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> usually has either one or two hills and/or valleys. If you want the data to be more precise and sensitive to fluctuations, you can increase the degree of freedom to the maximum value of 8. Go ahead and play with it.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer393" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.37: Polynomial degree of freedom edit</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Logarithmic Trend Lines</h3>
			<p>If variables increase/decrease quickly and the rate later flattens out, the best-fit lines are logarithmic trend lines. An example of a logarithmic trend line is inflation rate, where the inflation rate can increase/decrease quickly and eventually flatten as the economy starts to stabilize. Another example is the rate of learning for a novice versus an expert. When a novice starts learning a topic, the rate of learning is Very fast but as they master the topic, the rate of learning flattens out. Like a linear trend line, a logarithmic trend line can use both negative and positive values. </p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Exponential Trend Lines</h3>
			<p>The exponential trend line is the best-fit line that is most useful when the rate of the rise/fall of data is steep. The rate of spread of a virus is exponential, as an example from nature: COVID-19. The formula for an exponential trend line is as follows:</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Power Trend Lines</h3>
			<p>A power trend line is usually a curved line that is best utilized when the dataset contains measures that increase at a specific rate. Think about the rate of interest every year, the rate of water flow from a dam every minute, or the acceleration of a train or car. Although the trend line looks like a linear trend line, it is not linear, but curved. The formula for a power trend line is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer398" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_42.jpg" alt="Figure 5.42: Power trend line formula&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.42: Power trend line formula</p>
			<p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">Y</strong> is the dependent variable, <strong class="source-inline">X</strong> is the independent variable, which affects the dependent variable, and <strong class="source-inline">m1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">m2</strong> are the slope. The following figure shows a scatter plot with a power trend line:</p>
			<div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.43: Power trend line plot</p>
			<p>This wraps up the types of trend lines in Tableau. Next, you will explore the reliability of trend lines and the significance of R-squared values and p-values.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>The Reliability of Trend Lines</h2>
			<p>For each of the trend lines, you have a tooltip that includes the trend line formula, the R-squared value, and the p-value. For example, in a power trend line, <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong>, which is the dependent variable, is related to the independent variable of <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> as seen in the following formula:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer400" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_44.jpg" alt="Figure 5.44: Power trend line result&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.44: Power trend line result</p>
			<p>The way to read the formula is that for every unit increase in <em class="italic">Sales</em>, <em class="italic">Profit</em> will be calculated by multiplying <em class="italic">Sales</em> by the <em class="italic">power</em> of <em class="italic">1.158 </em> by <em class="italic">0.5591</em>. You will now explore the significance of R-squared values and p-values.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>R-Squared</h3>
			<p> As end users of the trend line, it is important to understand the reliability of these predictions. The trend line is considered most reliable when the R-squared value is closest to 1. This signals that there is an extremely high likelihood that future data/variables will fall within the predicted line (or close to it).</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>P-value</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">p-value</strong> is a statistical function that quantifies how likely it is that a given prediction happened by chance. The lower the p-value, the more statistically significant. In the power trend line example, the p-value was very small (<em class="italic">p &lt; 0.0001</em>), which means if you were to collect the data points for the report again, it is highly likely you would see a similar trend,  . For most use cases, any p-value greater than <em class="italic">p &gt; 0.05</em> is considered statistically insignificant, which means if you were to repeat the same data collection, you would likely not get a similar trend, since there is a greater than 5% chance the results were  due to randomness or chance.</p>
			<p>This wraps up the section on trend lines, where you explored the five default trend lines Tableau and the importance of R-squared and p-value. In the next section, you will compare two measures with one another via dual axis.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Advanced Charts</h1>
			<p>In previous exercises, you have explored distributions and relationships across single as well as multiple measures, which allows you to answer essential business questions relatively well. But Tableau offers advanced chart types, which can help answer complicated questions such as <em class="italic">What are the trends of profit with regard to sales by year?</em> You can easily answer this question by utilizing a dual axis chart. </p>
			<p>In this section, you will explore the following chart types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Quadrant charts</li>
				<li>Combination charts</li>
				<li>Lollipop charts</li>
				<li>Pareto charts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is certainly not an exhaustive list of the advanced charting available in Tableau; there are other interesting chart types such as donut charts, sparkline charts, Sankey diagrams, and waffle charts. But the charts above are some of the essential ones that are most frequently used in business dashboards, and are generally well received by end users.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Quadrant Charts</h2>
			<p>Quadrant charts are just scatter plots divided into four grids instead of two sections. In the scatter plots created previously (<em class="italic">Exercise 5.04</em>, <em class="italic">Creating a Scatter Plot</em>), you compared sales versus profits, but it was difficult to identify outliers, or marks that had high profit and high sales, or low profit and high sales. </p>
			<p>Quadrant charts can help . In this section, you will create a quadrant chart, as you can see in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer401" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_45.jpg" alt="Figure 5.45: Power trend line result&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.45: Power trend line result</p>
			<p>Before creating your quadrant chart, it is important to talk about reference lines and the options available.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Reference Lines</h2>
			<p>Reference lines do what their name suggests, adding a reference to our view. You can add reference lines either as constants or with calculated values of the axis. When you add a reference line with a computed value, the line is dynamic and adjusts depending on the specific field that the line is dependent on. </p>
			<p>Apart from reference lines, you can also add confidence intervals to lines.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer402" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_05_46.jpg" alt="Figure 5.46: Reference line for average sales for the Superstore dataset&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.46: Reference line for average sales for the Superstore dataset</p>
			<p>In the preceding screenshot, the reference line added in the view represents the average sales each quarter across the dataset. Adding reference lines helps to create a reference point where the reference point can be compared with the overall view.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Understanding Reference Lines</h3>
			<p>To better understand the importance of reference lines, you will now create a sample view of sales by year and explore the types of reference lines available in Tableau:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Entire Table Reference Line</strong>: The scope of this type of reference line is the entire table.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Per Pane Reference Line</strong>: This type of reference line is added to each sub-section of the view.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Per Cell Reference Line</strong>: With this reference line type, you add a reference line for each individual cell in the view.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The steps to this are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Assuming you have the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset open in Tableau instance, add <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong>, then drag <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> (<em class="italic">Ctrl </em>+ drag for Windows or <em class="italic">Option </em>+ drag for Mac) to the <strong class="source-inline">Columns</strong> shelf.</li>
				<li>Drag <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Rows</strong> shelf and, to add color to the view, drag <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Color Marks</strong> card:</li>

			<p>In this exercise, you will analyze store data to find both overall profit across all orders, as well as  profit ratio. A reference point should be present in the view that allows anyone to quickly understand higher profit and higher profit ratio orders, as well as lower profit and higher loss-making orders.</p>
			<p>The best chart to fulfill these requirements is the quadrant chart, because it allows for scatter plot-creation with vertical and horizontal reference lines, which will help create a reference point with regard to profit versus profit ratio. </p>
			<p>You will be using the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset. By the end of the exercise, you should be able to understand the different types of reference lines available in Tableau. </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Combination Charts – Dual axis Charts</h2>
			<p>Combination charts (otherwise known as dual axis charts or combo charts) are one of the most popular chart types due to their flexibility and the value they add to storytelling. Dual axis chart types are essentially two charts merged into one with a shared axis. For example, a date dimension could be the <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> axis and you could have two separate <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> axes on the same chart representing two different measures. An example of a dual axis chart for our <strong class="source-inline">Superstore</strong> dataset would be the trends of profit with regard to sales by year. Here, <strong class="source-inline">Year</strong> will be the <strong class="source-inline">Date</strong> dimension (<strong class="source-inline">x</strong> axis) and Sales and Profit will be the <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> axis. You will create a dual axis chart with similar mark types as part of the section. </p>

			<p>This brings to close the main body of the chapter. You will now  complete some activities to build on what you have learned.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Activity 5.01: Creating Scatter Plots</h2>
			<p>Imagine you work as an e-commerce analyst and your manager has asked you to create a view of <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> versus <strong class="source-inline">Profit Ratio</strong>. (Use <strong class="source-inline">Profit</strong>, if <strong class="source-inline">Profit Ratio</strong> is unavailable for you.) They want to see the metric broken down by <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Year</strong>. You will use scatter plots to achieve this, and will fulfill the requirements using the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">The following steps will help you complete this activity:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset in Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Double-click or drag <strong class="source-inline">Profit Ratio</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Columns</strong> shelf.</li>

				<li>De-aggregate the measure by navigating to <strong class="source-inline">Analysis</strong> and unselecting the aggregate measures.</li>
				<li>Add <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Color Marks</strong> card and <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Shape Marks</strong> card.</li>
				<li>Next, add <strong class="source-inline">Segment</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Filters</strong> and show it in your view.</li>
				<li>Repeat the same step for <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong>, by dragging <strong class="source-inline">Order Date</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Filter</strong> shelf.</li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Activity 5.02: Dual axis Chart with Asynchronous Axes</h2>
			<p>This activity continues on from the last. After fulfilling the initial scatter plot requirements, you are now  tasked with creating a dual axis chart, that shows how <strong class="source-inline">Discounts</strong> affect <strong class="source-inline">Sales</strong> month by month. Essentially, you are asked to create a view of sales versus discounts by month using a dual axis chart with an asynchronous dual axis. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">The following steps will help you complete this activity:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="source-inline">Sample – Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create the initial bar chart showing <strong class="source-inline">Sales by Order Date by Month (Continuous)</strong>.</li>
				<li>Change the chart type from <strong class="source-inline">Line</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Bar</strong> from the <strong class="source-inline">Marks</strong> card.</li>
				<li>Drag <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">Column</strong> shelf.</li>
				<li>Create a dual axis by right-clicking on any of the measures in the <strong class="source-inline">Column</strong> shelf.</li>
				<li>Change the mark type of <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong> from <strong class="source-inline">Bar</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Line</strong> from the <strong class="source-inline">Marks</strong> shelf.</li>
				<li>Don’t synchronize your axes, because if you do, the <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong> axis will have a range of 0-120,000%, which in reality does not exist.</li>
				<li>Format the chart by adding the <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong> label for <strong class="source-inline">Discount</strong>, and edit the color of the Discount line chart to blue, or any color you prefer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The final expected output is as follows:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.64: Final output of Activity 5.02</p>
			<p>In this activity, you created a dual axis chart with different marks types for the measures, and explored why synchronizing the axes is not always a good idea, as it can lead to extrapolating or under-reporting the actual numbers. </p>
			<p>The way to read the preceding dual axis chart is, say, for <strong class="source-inline">April 2016</strong>, the average discount was <strong class="source-inline">11%</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Total Sales</strong> that month were <strong class="source-inline">$28,295</strong>.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.65: Dual axis final output of Activity 5.02</p>
			<p>Similarly, for the month of <strong class="source-inline">December 2018</strong>, you should notice that the average discount was <strong class="source-inline">14%</strong> while <strong class="source-inline">Total Sales</strong> that month were <strong class="source-inline">$96,999</strong>. If you sync your dual axes, the average discount percentage would probably be in the thousands, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 5.73</em>.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you explored distribution with one-measure histograms, box and whisker plots, and multiple-measure scatter plots. You also saw in detail the types of trend lines available in Tableau, why they are used, and which trend lines are most appropriate for given situations. Then, you learned how to check whether a trend line created by Tableau is reliable,   and touched on the R-squared value and p-value. Finally, you  explored advanced chart types, where we interacted with dual axis  and quadrant charts. Finally, you completed some activities on dual axis charts with asynchronous axes, as well as scatter plots with filters and shapes.</p>
			<p>You are now at the stage where you can start to answer data questions using all the different types of you have created. You can start adding readability elements , and you can also create advanced visualizations if the view requires you to answer multiple questions at once (such as profit versus sales trend by quarter on a dual axis chart).</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will move away from standard data and on to  geographical data, where you will dive deeper into maps and the formatting options available.</p>
