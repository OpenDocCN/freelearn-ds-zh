    be seen from a specified location. This coverage is called a **viewshed**, which
    is why the terms **visibility analysis** and **viewshed analysis** are used interchangeably.
    To perform a simple visibility analysis, you need to define at least two components:'

  zh: 可视性分析的目标是从指定位置生成一个可见区域的覆盖。这个覆盖称为**可视域**，这就是为什么使用**可视性分析**和**可视域分析**这两个术语可以互换的原因。要执行简单的可视性分析，您至少需要定义以下两个组件：

    the observation point against the height of earth''s surface point along the given
    line of sight. If the height of the surface point is less than that of the observation
    point, then it will be seen from the current position; if it is higher, the visibility
    line will be blocked. Similarly, all points within a certain radius are compared
    against the observation point and divided into the two categories, as follows:'

- en: The most typical practical application of visibility analysis is in placement
    of communication towers, where instead of visibility, signal penetration is modeled.
    Viewsheds are also of great use in territorial and urban planning. For example,
    some features such as factories or landfills are expected to be hidden from the
    human' eye because of their unsightly appearance. In this case, the area undergoes
    a visibility analysis to find places from where such kinds of objects can't be
    seen. The more the blind spots associated with a certain point, the better it
    is for the object's location. Furthermore, instead of hiding some objects, viewsheds
    are used to detect scenery points that provide the most spectacular view of an
    area. This knowledge is then used for optimal placement of the sight places, which
    is what we are going to do in this chapter.

    we will simply move the slider to the fourth tick, which gives an output resolution
    close to 400 x 400 pixels and resamples the original DEM to approximately 26.8
    feet. This approach is fast and produces a lightweight output, but resampling
    values affects the DEM's resolution, not the texture draped over it. If you want
    to produce more sophisticated and high-resolution results, read about the advanced
    settings, but bear in mind that high-resolution output takes more time to export,
    and also that the scene itself will require more computer resources to be responsive
    and rendered fast.
