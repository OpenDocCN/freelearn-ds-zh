			<p>This book aims to demystify quantum chemistry and computing, discuss the future of quantum technologies based on current limitations, demonstrate the usefulness and shortcomings of the current implementations of quantum theory, and share our love of the topic.</p>
			<p>This book is not a traditional presentation of quantum chemistry nor quantum computing, but rather an explanation of how the two topics intertwine through the illustration of the postulates of quantum mechanics, particularly with Python code and open-source quantum chemistry packages.</p>
			<p>Quantum chemistry has many applications in industry, from pharmaceutical design to energy creation and the development of quantum computing in recent years. With adequate knowledge of quantum chemistry and the postulates of quantum mechanics, we can overcome some of the major hurdles humanity faces and achieve positive impacts. We hope that you can learn sufficient details to be a part of the new and productive solutions moving forward.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Readers we target</h1>
			<p>All kinds of readers are welcome. However, the people who will benefit the most are those interested in chemistry and computer science at the early stages of learning; advanced high school and early college students, or professionals wanting to acquire a background in quantum chemistry as it relates to computing, both from an algorithm and hardware standpoint. We also summarize useful mathematics and calculus as it relates to solving chemistry problems. The topics will appeal to people of various industry verticals who are interested in a career in quantum computational chemistry and computing.</p>
			<p>You will be at the forefront of exciting state-of-the-art opportunities to expand your ideas and start experimenting with your simulations.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>A fast path to using quantum chemistry</h1>
			<p>We chose to write this book in such a way as to demystify the fundamentals of quantum concepts for a curious audience. This book introduces the basics of quantum chemical concepts by describing the five postulates of quantum mechanics, including how these concepts relate to quantum information theory, including basic programming examples of atomic and molecular systems with Python, SimPy [Simpy], QuTiP [QuTiP], and open-source quantum chemistry packages PySCF [PySCF], ASE [ASE_0], PyQMC [PyQMC], Psi4 [Psi4_0], and Qiskit [Qiskit] code. An introductory level of understanding Python is sufficient to read the code, and a browser is all that is required to access the Google Colaboratory and run the companion Jupyter notebooks we provide in the cloud. Each chapter includes an artistic rendering of quantum concepts related to historical quotes.</p>
			<p>Through the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, there has been amazing progress in the development of computational chemistry packages and, most recently, Qiskit Nature [Qiskit_Nature] [Qiskit_Nat_0]. We outline and introduce basic quantum chemical concepts that are discussed in a modern fashion and relate these concepts to quantum information theory and computation. We use Python, PySCF, and Qiskit Nature for illustrative purposes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Quantum chemistry</h1>
			<p>The fundamentals of quantum mechanics and the five postulates directly impact material research and computational chemistry for finding new drugs and catalysts, enabling efficient and cleaner processes for converting chemicals from one form to another. Quantum chemistry is also essential for designing future quantum computers that use the properties of atoms and/or ions. However, quantum chemistry remains an elusive topic that seemingly takes many years to master.</p>
			<p>We think that the traditionally long-term achievement of literacy of the topic is directly related to the perceived complexity of the topic and historical approximations made to increase accessibility and usability with conventional computing. With approximation in place and wide acceptance by the scientific community as the only way forward, some fundamental concepts are often overlooked, misunderstood, and eliminated from the disciplines depending on these ideas. We see this as an opportunity to share our love of quantum chemistry in its full potential to enhance the friendliness of and approachability of the topic. </p>
			<p>We will share sufficient details so that you understand the limitations that were historically established. For instance, we present a general formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle for all elementary particles that also holds for composite particles, which many textbooks do not adequately explain.</p>
			<p>There is more to the quantum story but too much to be included as a first book for the curious. Therefore, we plan to write a following book that expands cutting-edge quantum ideas that are not yet widely used in the scientific community.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>How to navigate the book</h1>
			<p>We advise you to follow the sequential ordering of chapters and gradually master the concepts, methods, and tools that will be useful later in the book.</p>
