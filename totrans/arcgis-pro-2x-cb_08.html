<p>If you have been working through the previous chapters in this book, you have learned how to access, visualize, convert, and maintain data using ArcGIS Pro. While these capabilities alone would make ArcGIS Pro a very powerful tool, those are by no means the limits of what you can accomplish with ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro is capable of performing some amazing analysis. These capabilities are generally broken down into four categories: overlay, proximity, network, and statistical. These can be further specialized as well. As was pointed out in <a href="45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology</em>, there are two things that determine what tools are available to you, license level and extensions. The license level will determine what core tools are available to you. The extensions will determine what specialized tools you will be able to access. So, it is always important to know what license level you are using and what extensions you have access to. Review <a href="45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span><em>ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology</em>,</span> for more information about license levels.</p>
<p>Let’s now focus on proximity analysis in ArcGIS Pro. Proximity analysis is simply determining how far or close features are from one another. This could be as simple as selecting features that are within a specified distance from other features, or as complex as calculating the distances between features in one or more layers. Examples of proximity analysis include creating a buffer around selected features to show the area around those features at a set distance. It might be calculating how far features in one layer are from features in another layer and writing those values to a data table. It might be determining which feature in one layer is the closest to a feature in another layer.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will get some first-hand experience of performing various types of proximity analysis. This will include creating buffers, selecting features based on distance, determining the nearest feature, and calculating how far features are from other features. Some of these recipes will require you to have an Advanced license for ArcGIS Pro.</p>

<p>For this recipe, the roads superintendent has told you he will be starting a new project along Sloan St. and needs to notify those living and working near the street. He has asked you to generate a list of all the parcels located within 500 feet of Sloan Street, so he can notify them of the upcoming work.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will use the Select by Location tool to select all the parcels within 500 feet of Sloan Street, and then export the selected parcels to an Excel spreadsheet to give to the superintendent. Before you can use the Select by Location tool, you will need to select all the road centerline segments that make up Sloan Street. You will use the Select by Attribute tool to do that.    </p>

<div class="packt_tip">
<p>The Select Layer by Location tool automatically uses only selected features in the Selecting Features layer because it is a geoprocessing tool. Geoprocessing tools automatically run using selected features for any input layers or tables. So, unlike the Select by Location tool in ArcMap, you are not required to tell ArcGIS Pro to use selected features.</p>
<p>The Select Layer by Location tool is not limited to only selecting features within a specified distance. It can be used to select features based on several types of spatial relationships, including intersect, are contained by, share a boundary, and more. This makes it a very powerful tool when you need to select features based on their spatial relationship.</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When the tool finishes, you should end up with 107 total selected features. That includes three selected Street Centerline segments and 104 parcels. Now, all that is left is to export the selected parcels to an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p>So, in this recipe, you needed to create a list that the roads superintendent could use to notify all those that live or work near Sloan Street of an upcoming project. To do this you first had to select all the segments that made up Sloan Street in the GIS database. You performed an attribute query using the Select by Attributes tool. You then used this selection in the Select by Location tool to select all parcels within 500 feet of the selected segments of Sloan Street. Lastly, you exported the selected parcels that were near Sloan Street to a spreadsheet. The roads superintendent will then be able to use it to notify all those near the upcoming road project.</p>
<p>This recipe has not only shown you how to select features that are within a specified distance of other features, it has also illustrated that analysis is often a multiple step process. It requires you to use a range of tools and skills to arrive at an answer.</p>

<p>Buffers allow you to see what features are within a specific distance of other features. It generates polygons around the buffered features that provide the visual reference of the specified distance. These polygons can then be used to perform additional analysis or select features that are within, or intersect, the buffers.   </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will create a buffer around the creeks and streams in the City of Trippville that will represent a protective zone where special permits are required to perform work. This is due to a recent ordinance passed by the city council to protect water quality in and around the city.   </p>

<p>You have just created a new feature class in the project geodatabase, that represents the protective area around the creeks and streams. You can easily see the areas that are impacted by this new protective zone. You could also use this layer to perform various analyses. For example, you could use the Select by Location tool to select all parcels that intersect the protective buffer. This will allow you to know exactly which parcels would need a permit for any work they do near one of the creeks or streams. You could use the Union geoprocessing tool to calculate how much of each parcel is within the protective zone and how much is outside.</p>

<p>You have just learned how to create a single buffer around features using the Buffer tool. But what if you need to create several buffers at various distances around a set of features or a single layer? You could just use the buffer tool multiple times. However, there is an easier way.</p>
<p>The fire chief for the city of Trippville is working on a fire protection study and needs your help to determine the level of protection provided by the fire hydrants within the city. He needs to know how much of each parcel is 100, 200, and 300 feet from each hydrant. You will use the Multiple Ring Buffer tool to accomplish this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First we will clean up the <span class="packt_screen">Buffer</span> map you have been using. Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Natwtr_Stream_Buffer</span> layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Remove</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Repeat this process for the Creeks, Streams, Lakes and Rivers layers.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Catalog</span> pane, expand the <span class="packt_screen">Databases</span> folder so you can see its contents.</li>
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville_GIS.gdb</span> geodatabase.</li>
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Water</span> feature dataset and right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">fire_hyd</span> feature class. Select <span class="packt_screen">Add to Current Map</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Save your project.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> group to open the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>

<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Multiple Ring Buffer</span> tool to open it in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane. Notice that it has a different icon from all the other tools. That is because this tool is actually a Python script.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Python is the primary scripting language for ArcGIS. It allows you to create custom tools that help automate tasks. These can then be scheduled to run automatically, at specified times, or run manually. To learn more about creating Python scripts for ArcGIS, you may want to check out Programming ArcGIS with Python by Eric Pimpler, at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/programming-arcgis-python-cookbook-second-edition">https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/programming-arcgis-python-cookbook-second-edition</a>.</p>

<li>Accept the default value for the <span class="packt_screen">Output Feature Class</span>.</li>
<li>Type <kbd>100</kbd> in the cell under <span class="packt_screen">Distances</span> and press the <em>Enter</em> key. Another cell should appear.</li>

<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Dissolve Option</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Non-overlapping (Rings) or All depending on your ArcGIS Pro version</span>. This will allow the fire chief to know how much coverage he has at each distance.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>The Dissolve Option determines whether you create rings/donuts or disks. The Non-overlapping or All options will generate rings that resemble donuts. The overlapping area from the other specified distances is cut out. So in this example, you will get a single ring that extends out to 100 feet. The next ring will cover from 100 to 200 feet. The last ring will cover from 200 to 300 feet.</p>
<p>The Overlapping (disks) or None option creates solid disks that overlap. Using this recipe as an example, you will have one disk that extends out to 100 feet. You will have a second disk that extends out to 200 feet and overlaps the first disk. The last disk will extend out to 300 feet and overlap the other two disks.</p>
<p>You are not required to set your buffer distances to equal intervals. They can be any distance you wish.

<p>So, you have just created a new layer that represents distances around the fire hydrants in the city. This will allow the fire chief to easily determine how much protection the fire hydrants provide the citizens and businesses. Using this data, he can determine if any new fire hydrants should be installed to improve the fire protection in the city.</p>

<p>You have seen how we can use buffers to show areas that are within a specified distance from features. This allows us to see if other features are within that area. We can also use those areas to perform additional analysis. However, these are all general measurements. They do not tell us which feature is the closest to another feature. How do we determine which feature is closest to another feature?</p>
<p>If you have an advanced license for ArcGIS Pro, this is pretty easy. The Near tool will determine the closest feature for you. Not only will it determine which feature is closest, but it also has options to calculate the distance, direction, coordinates, and more of the closest features. The Near tool works with points, lines, and polygons. You can also specify that it only searches for the closest feature within a specified distance. So lets put this tool into action. </p>
<p>In this recipe, you will continue to assist the Fire Chief. He is still working on his fire protection study. He wants to know which fire hydrant is closest to each parcel, so the department will know exactly which hydrant they should connect to when responding to a given location. You will use the Near tool to calculate which hydrant is closest to each parcel.  </p>

<p>You will need to make sure you have an Advanced license for ArcGIS Pro to complete this recipe. You will not be able to do it with a Basic or Standard license. If you are not sure what license level you have or how to determine it, refer to <a href="45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span><em>ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology</em>,</span> and the recipe entitled <em>Determining your ArcGIS Pro license level</em>.  That recipe outlines the steps required to determine your license level, if you do not remember.</p>
<p>If you are limited to a Basic or Standard license, then please read through this recipe and then proceed with the <em>There’s more...</em> section, which can be completed with a lower license level.</p>
<p>It is also recommended, you complete the other recipes in this chapter before starting this one. This will ensure that you have a good basic understanding of proximity analysis within ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p>You will also need to ensure the sample data is installed before you continue.  </p>

<ol>
<li>To begin, launch  ArcGIS Pro using the same method you have in previous recipes, and then launch the <kbd>Nearest Feature.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter8\Proximity Analysis</kbd> using the skills you have learned in past recipes.</li>
<li>It should open with the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville Fire Protection Map</span>. Verify that this map contains the <span class="packt_screen">Fire Hydrant</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layers at a minimum. It should look like the following. Your scale may be different depending on the size of your monitor and what panes you have open:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899 image-border" height="1004" src="assets/e4d1c9e5-2078-421a-bfa8-db4873e37147.png" width="1910"/></div>

<li>Right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane and select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Review the available fields and answer the following question:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What fields are associated with the parcels in the attribute table?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, there are only a few fields associated with the parcels. The attribute table is currently storing the ObjectID, Shape, LOTNUM, STNUMBER, STNAME, STSUFFIX, Shape_Length, Shape_Area, and Acres. There is nothing here that tells you which fire hydrant is closest to each parcel. You are about to change that.  </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels attribute</span> table by clicking the small <span class="packt_screen">X</span> next to the table name in the tab at the top of the table view. This will free up more screen real estate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>If you have multiple monitors, or a really large one, you could also undock and drag the table pane to a different monitor or location as well. This would free up space for viewing the map, but also allow you to continue to view the table. Also, ArcGIS Pro lets you display each table in its own window if you desire, unlike ArcMap, which forces all tables into a single window.</p>
</div>

</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>You can set more than one layer or feature class as the Near Features. Also, Input Features and Near Features can be the same if you are looking for the nearest feature in the same layer.  </p>

<ol start="12">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Search Radius</span> to 300 feet by typing in <kbd>300</kbd> and ensuring the units are feet. The Fire Chief has indicated that any parcel over 300 feet from a hydrant is considered to not be adequately protected.</li>
<li>Go ahead and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Location and Angle</span> boxes. This will provide additional information for the closest Hydrant.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>The Location option will add the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for the nearest hydrant to the Parcel attribute table. The Angle option will add the angle to the nearest hydrant based on grid north.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Near tool is one of the few geoprocessing tools that actually edits existing data. In the case of the Near tool, it will add new fields to the Parcels attribute table since the Parcels layer is set as the Input Features. For more information on the Near tool, go to <a href="http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/analysis/near.htm">http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/analysis/near.htm</a>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">Notice, this time no new layers were added to your map unlike the Buffer and Multiple Ring Buffer.

</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What fields have been added to the Parcels Attribute table by the Near tool?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, several new fields now appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> attribute table. This includes the <span class="packt_screen">Near_FID</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Near_Dist</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Near_X</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Near_Y</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Near_Angle</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">Those parcels with a -1 value in the fields are not within the 300 foot search radius you specified when your ran the Near tool. So those are easily identified as not having adequate fire protection. Those parcels that were within 300 feet of a hydrant now have the hydrants' feature ID (Near_FID), distance to the hydrant (Near_Dist), angle to the hydrant (Near_Angle), and X,Y coordinates (Near_X and Near_Y) assigned to each parcel. This allows you to learn which hydrant is closest to each parcel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Near_FID is the ObjectID for the nearest fire hydrant. You could use those two fields to join, relate, or create a relationship class between the two layers. This would allow you to access even more information.</p>

(Hint: The cardinality between the tables is a many to one.) Then, link them using the best method. Verify your choice by opening the Parcels attribute table and seeing if you can see or access the linked information from the nearest Fire Hydrant.

<p>The Near tool requires you to have an advanced license to determine which feature is the closest. What happens if you only have a basic or standard license? Is it possible to determine the closest feature without an advanced license?</p>
<p>Yes, you can, although it is not as straightforward and does produce a new feature class. You can use the Spatial Join tool. Let’s see how it works. This will assume that you have not been able to complete the recipe up to this point because you did not have an advanced license.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab. This will open the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>You can also find this tool in the Overlay analysis toolset in the Analysis Tools toolbox. The Spatial Join allows you to join layers or feature classes together based on many spatial relationships.</p>
</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Target Features</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> layer using the drop-down arrow and selecting it from the list.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Join Features</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Fire Hydrants</span>, also using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Accept the default <span class="packt_screen">Output Feature Class</span>, which should be something similar to <span class="packt_screen">Parcels_SpatialJoin</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Unlike the Near tool, the Spatial Join tool creates a completely new feature class. It does not simply add new fields to an existing layer. This means that your original Parcels layer is left unchanged.</p>
</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Join Operation</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Join one to one</span> using the drop-down arrow. You are using the one to one option because only one hydrant should be the closest to each parcel.</li>
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Keep All Target Features</span> checkbox is checked. This will ensure the resulting output feature class will contain all the parcels, even if they do not have a fire hydrant nearby.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <span class="packt_screen">Match Option</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Closest</span> using the drop-down arrow. This is the spatial relationship that ArcGIS Pro will use to join the data. Closest is near the bottom of the list. Take the time to see what other options are available.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Search Radius</span> to 300 feet, as we did when using the <span class="packt_screen">Near</span> tool. This limits the search for the closest fire hydrant to 300 feet.</li>
<li>Verify that your <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool looks like the following, then click <span class="packt_screen">Run</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902 image-border" height="438" src="assets/06495873-cf42-46ca-a0f8-df522f2b48a7.png" width="379"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>Depending on your computer, this tool may take a few minutes to run. So don’t be worried if it takes some time. This analysis requires a lot of processing to complete.</span></div>
<ol start="11">
<li>A new layer should appear in your <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane. This new layer is the result of the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool. Close the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
<li>Right-click on the new layer that was just added. Select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute table</span> from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>The attribute table contains information from both the <span class="packt_screen">Parcels</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Fire Hydrants</span> layer. Take a moment to review the results.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The Join_Count field tells you how many fire hydrants were joined to the parcels. Because you chose the Join one to one option, this number should either be a 1 or a 0. The Target_FID is the ObjectID for the closest fire hydrant to the parcel. The FireHyd_ID, X, Y, Picture, and Picture 2 fields all come from the closest fire hydrant to the parcel. The remaining fields all came from the parcels layer.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Close the attribute table when you are done.</li>
<li>Save your project and close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you now have two ways to calculate the nearest feature in ArcGIS Pro. If you have an advanced license you can use either method. If you only have a basic or standard, then you must use the Spatial Join. If you can use either, which is best? That depends on what you need to do with the resulting data. The Spatial Join is best when you are creating data that is intermediate to a large process and will not be needed later. Otherwise, it creates yet another layer you must maintain. The Near tool does not create more data for you to manage. It only adds to an existing layer of information that you are already maintaining.  </p>

<p>You now know a couple of different ways to find the closest feature. What if you want to calculate the distance from one group of features to another group? Not just looking for the closest. The Generate Near Table tool can do this.</p>
<p>The Generate Near Table tool will create a new database table that lists how far the features in the input are from those in the near feature layer.</p>
<p>Like the Near tool, you have the option to include additional fields for location and angle as well. This tool also requires an advanced license.</p>
<p>The city of Trippville has several water quality monitoring stations that monitor the quality of the water in the creeks, streams, and rivers in the city. Recently, several of them have been reporting poor or bad water quality.</p>
<p>It is believed that this might be due to run off from an industrial site in the city.</p>
<p>In this recipe, you will use the Generate Near Table tool to identify all industrial parcels located near the stations reporting bad water quality. These will be the ones you need to inspect first to see if they are the cause of the bad water quality.</p>

<p>You will need to make sure you have an advanced license for ArcGIS Pro to complete this recipe. You will not be able to do it with a basic or standard license. If you are not sure what license level you have or how to determine it, <span>refer to </span><a href="45fda239-2b00-4355-9553-6c6c2b69b0ab.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span><em>ArcGIS Pro Capabilities and Terminology</em>,</span><span> and the recipe entitled <em>Determining your ArcGIS Pro license level</em></span>. That recipe will tell you how to determine your license level.</p>
<p>If you are limited to a basic or standard license, then please read through this recipe and then proceed with the <em>There’s more...</em> section, which can be completed with a lower license level.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you complete the other recipes in this chapter before starting this one. This will ensure that you have a good basic understanding of proximity analysis within ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p>You will also need to ensure the sample data is installed before you continue.</p>

<li>You will start by launching ArcGIS Pro. Then open the <kbd>Near Table.aprx</kbd> project located in <kbd>C:\Student\ArcGISProCookbook\Chapter8\Proximity Analysis</kbd> using the skills you have learned in past recipes. The project should open with the <span class="packt_screen">Trippville</span> map. You will start by selecting the industrial-zoned parcels.</li>
<li>Activate the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the ribbon and select the <span class="packt_screen">Select by Attributes</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group. The <span class="packt_screen">Select Layer by Attributes</span> tool will open in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Name</span> <span class="packt_screen">or Table View</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Zoning</span> using the drop-down arrow and selecting it from the list.</li>
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Selection Type</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">New selection</span>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add Clause</span> button to begin building your query.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Field</span> to <span class="packt_screen">ZONING</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Make sure the operator is set to <span class="packt_screen">is Equal to</span>.</li>
<li>The value should be set to <span class="packt_screen">HI</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Verify that your query looks like the following, and click the <span class="packt_screen">Add</span> button:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903 image-border" height="68" src="assets/bd6aab47-bbe2-4adc-9f96-e0d0f35cf541.png" width="386"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Clause</span> button again. The clause you just added will only select those parcels that are in the <strong>Heavy Industrial</strong> (<strong>HI</strong>) zone. You also need to select those that are <strong>Light Industrial</strong> (<strong>LI</strong>).</li>
<li>Where it says <span class="packt_screen">And</span>, click the drop-down arrow and select <span class="packt_screen">Or</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>And and Or are clause connectors. They determine how clauses in a query work together. If you had left the query with And, then the selection would have to meet both clauses. Since a parcel cannot be zoned both heavy and light industrial, that means nothing would be selected. Or means it only has to meet the requirements of one of the two clauses. So in this case, the query will select all features that are zoned either light or heavy industrial. </p>
</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Field</span> to <span class="packt_screen">ZONING</span>, the operator to <span class="packt_screen">is Equal to</span>, and the value to <span class="packt_screen">LI</span>. Then, click <span class="packt_screen">Add</span> once you verify it looks like the following screenshot:</li>

<ol start="13">
<li>Your <span class="packt_screen">Select Layer by Attributes</span> tool should now contain two SQL Where clauses. This will select all the parcels that are zoned either light or heavy industrial.

<p style="padding-left: 60px">When you run the query, approximately 152 parcels should be selected within the map. All of them should be zoned either light or heavy industrial. Next, you need to select the <span class="packt_screen">Water Quality Stations</span> that are reporting bad water quality. You will do this with another Select by Attribute query.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>If you closed the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane with the <span class="packt_screen">Select Layer by Attribute</span> tool, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Select by Attributes</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab.

<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane, ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Select Layer by Attribute</span> tool is still active.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Layer Name or Table View</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Water Quality Station</span> using the drop-down arrow. If your old query is still present in the expression, an error may appear when you make this change. You can ignore it for now as you will be creating a new query soon.</li>
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">Selection type</span> is still set to <span class="packt_screen">New selection</span>.</li>

<p>So, can you do this without an advanced license of ArcGIS Pro? The answer is yes. You can use the Spatial Join tool to accomplish something very similar. However, the result is not a table. It is a new feature class that will contain many overlapping features. If you just want a table, you can then export the records from the results of the Spatial Join tool to a new table. Here is how all that works:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you still have the features selected from the Water Quality Station and Zoning layers, proceed to the next step. If you do not, repeat <em>steps 2-24</em> from the recipe. You should have two Water Quality Stations and 151 Zoning polygons selected.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span> tab in the ribbon. Then select the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> group. This will open the tool in the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> window.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Target Features</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Water Quality Station</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Join Features</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Zoning</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Browse</span> button to set the <span class="packt_screen">Output Feature Class</span>.</li>
<li>Select databases from the panel on the left. Then double-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Proximity Analysis.gdb</span> geodatabase in the panel on the right.</li>
<li>Type <kbd>WaterQual_IndustZoned_SpatialJoin</kbd> into the <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> and click <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Join Operation</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Join</span> <span class="packt_screen">one to many</span>. This will ensure the result has all the industrial-zoned parcels within 1,500 feet of the water quality stations reporting bad quality.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Match Option</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Within a distance</span> using the drop-down arrow.</li>
<li>Set the <span class="packt_screen">Search Radius</span> to 1,500 feet.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>Verify that your <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool looks like the following, and click <span class="packt_screen">Run</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911 image-border" height="442" src="assets/ed89edfa-f094-4328-b51f-ae9ce3acb816.png" width="367"/></div>
<ol start="12">
<li>A new layer will appear in your <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane. This is the results of the <span class="packt_screen">Spatial Join</span> tool. Close the <span class="packt_screen">Geoprocessing</span> pane.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">List by Draw Order</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane. It is the first button at the top-left of the pane.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab in the ribbon. Then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Clear</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Selection</span> group. You should now be able to see what looks like two new features that overlap the two Water Quality Stations that had bad water quality. Time to verify how many features are actually in those locations.</li>
<li>Right-click on the new layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Zoom to Layer</span>.</li>
<li>Select the new layer in the <span class="packt_screen">Contents</span> pane.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="17">
<li>Click on the drop-down arrow located below the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tool and select <span class="packt_screen">Selected in Contents</span>. Now click on one of the two new features. The information popup should appear when you click on one of the features.</li>
<li>Look at the lower-left corner of the information popup to see how many features are actually in the location you selected. If you clicked on the northernmost location, you should have about 30 features. If you clicked on the southernmost location, you should have about 14 features. This is illustrated in the following:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912 image-border" height="433" src="assets/79e98985-70e3-4333-b411-4e8d7636d92f.png" width="785"/></div>
<ol start="19">
<li>Right-click on the new layer and select <span class="packt_screen">Attribute Table</span> to look at the resulting attributes. Review the table and see if you can identify what the fields mean and where they came from.</li>
<li>Close the attribute table and save your project.</li>
<li>Close ArcGIS Pro.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, you have created another new feature class. If you wanted to export this as a standalone table, you could right-click on the layer and go to <span class="packt_screen">Data</span>. Then select <span class="packt_screen">Export Table</span>. If you wanted to export it to an Excel spreadsheet you could use the Table to Excel tool you have used in past recipes.</p>
