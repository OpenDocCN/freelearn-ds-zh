    very powerful GIS solution for an organization. They allow you to maintain, analyze,
    and share GIS data with those inside and outside your organization, which in turn
    increases the effectiveness and flexibility of your GIS.

    can also create and share web applications with ArcGIS Online. You may be thinking
    to yourself, *I am not a programmer*. *I have no idea how to create applications*.
    That is OK. With ArcGIS Online, you do not need to be a programmer to create quick
    but effective web applications which allow others to access the data and maps
    you have created. With just a little ArcGIS Online know-how, it is possible to
    create a web application similar to the one shown here in 5 to 10 minutes:'

    and easily, even if you have no prior programming experience. The first is using
    one of the many predefined application templates Esri has created. The second
    is to use Esri’s Web AppBuilder to create custom applications using a wizard.
    Either method allows you to create web applications or apps which users can then
    access via their favorite web browser to begin using your GIS content. This is
    a great way to extend your GIS to users that don’t have access to or the skills
    to use ArcGIS Pro. You maintain and publish the data and maps, while the users
    do what they need to with the data via the web applications. They do not need
    to be a GIS guru. They have access to tools that allow them to use the GIS so
    they can do their jobs easier and better.

- en: In this chapter, you will learn how to create some simple applications quickly
    and easily using both of these methods. Then, you will learn how you can share
    your applications with others, both inside and outside your organization. You
    will start by creating an application using one of the many Esri standard application
    templates. Then you will create a custom application using Web AppBuilder.

- en: Being able to publish your data and maps via a web app opens up a whole new
    level of use and accessibility that is not possible when sharing as simple web
    maps, feature services, or data downloads. A web application allows you to include
    functionalities provided by some of the tools you have in ArcGIS Pro. You can
    allow people to pan and zoom, query, print, edit, and more from within the application.
    This allows even those without GIS experience or software to become GIS users.

- en: In the past, you had to have programming skills to create GIS web applications.
    That is no longer the case. Now, there are tools that allow anyone that has some
    basic GIS and computer skills to create their own GIS web applications. As mentioned
    in the introduction, ArcGIS Online includes several predefined web application
    templates that you can use to create your own application. Currently, you have
    access to over 20 application templates. These require little to no programming
    knowledge. All you do is plug in your maps and data, configure a few items, and
    off you go. Depending on the template you choose and the functionality you desire,
    you can have a web application up and running in under 5 minutes.

    [Chapter 12](4ba4882e-2afc-4bb8-9906-cb4ef46722ca.xhtml), *Introducing ArcGIS
    Online*, and publish it as a web application. The client wants a web application
    that will allow his dispatchers and sales teams to input the address where the
    concrete is to be delivered and to see which, if any, of their plants can provide
    the concrete.

- en: Corbin Concrete was very impressed with the web app you created for them in
    the previous recipe. It has really helped them see the value of GIS. This has
    given them another idea for a second application which will be used primarily
    by their sales team. They want a new app which has more capability. They want
    to be able to be able to draw in the app to show the location the concrete will
    be poured and be able to print it for the inside estimators. They also want the
    app to be able to locate the nearest plant to a location, as well as to be able
    to find any plant within a specified distance.

    which meets the needs of Corbin Concrete as outlined before. You will start with
    the existing Corbin Concrete web map you created in the previous recipe. You will
    then use Web AppBuilder to create and configure the new application with the required
    widgets as well as its general appearance.

    Trippville Basic Map that you created in [Chapter 12](4ba4882e-2afc-4bb8-9906-cb4ef46722ca.xhtml),
    *Introducing ArcGIS Online*. You will then add the zoning layer, which has already
    been published to the map, to create the new Zoning Map. Then you will share and
    embed the new map in the web page.
