- en: The success of Hadoop as a big data platform raised user expectations, both
    in terms of solving different analytics challenges as well as reducing latency.
    Various tools evolved over time, but when Apache Spark came, it provided one single
    runtime to address all these challenges. It eliminated the need to combine multiple
    tools with their own challenges and learning curves. By using memory for persistent
    storage besides compute, Apache Spark eliminates the need to store intermedia
    data in disk and increases processing speed up to 100 times. It also provides
    a single runtime, which addresses various analytics needs such as machine-learning
    and real-time streaming using various libraries.
