    and packages. This vast array of choices can be overwhelming for newcomers to
    geospatial analysis. The secret to learning geospatial analysis quickly is understanding
    the handful of libraries and packages that really matter. Most software, both
    commercial and open source, is derived from these critical packages. Understanding
    the ecosystem of geospatial software and how it's used allows you to quickly comprehend
    and evaluate any geospatial tool.

    Geospatial Data*, geospatial datasets are typically large, complex, and varied.
    This challenge makes libraries that efficiently read, and in some cases write,
    this data essential to geospatial analysis. Without access to data, geospatial
    analysis cannot begin.

    An image library that resamples data without permission, or a computational geometry
    library that rounds a coordinate by even a couple of decimal places, can adversely

    deceptive because some tasks are visually easy to understand and implement, some

    Google Earth was a very animated and fun geographic exploration tool, but it really
    had a very limited utility for any kind of meaningful geospatial analysis. Google
    Earth falls squarely into the realm of geospatial viewer software.

    2](a7a60707-fb99-41d3-959c-7ed43a469c55.xhtml), *Learning* *Geospatial Data*.
    As this format is now an OGC standard, consuming only one data format immediately
    limits the utility of any tool. Any project involving Google Earth must first
    begin with complete data conversion and styling in KML, reminiscent of geospatial
    analysis from around 10-20 years ago. The tools that do support KML, including
    Google Maps, support a limited subset of KML.

    spanning several years and sources. Google has greatly improved the inline metadata
    in the tool, which identifies the source and approximate date of the current view.
    But, this method creates confusion among lay people. Many people believe that
    the data in Google Earth is updated far more frequently than it really is. The
    Google Street View system, showing street-level, 360-degree views of much of the
    world, has somewhat helped to correct this misperception.
  prefs: []

    years old. Another common misperception created by Google Earth is that the entire
    world has been mapped in detail, and therefore creating a base map for geospatial
    analysis should be trivial. As discussed in [Chapter 2](a7a60707-fb99-41d3-959c-7ed43a469c55.xhtml),
    *Learning* *Geospatial Data*, mapping an area of interest is far easier than it
    used to be a few years ago by using modern data and software, but it is still
    a complex and labor-intensive endeavor. This misperception is one of the first
    customer expectations a geospatial analyst must manage when starting a project.
  prefs: []

- en: Despite these misperceptions, the impact that Google has had on geospatial analysis
    is almost entirely positive. For decades, one of the most difficult challenges
    to growing the geospatial industry was convincing potential stakeholders that
    geospatial analysis is almost always the best approach when making decisions about
    people, resources, and the environment. This hurdle stands in sharp contrast to
    a car dealer. When a potential customer comes to a car lot, the salesman doesn't
    have to convince the buyer that they need a car, just about the type of car.

    Data custodians are able to release a dataset to the entire world for download
    without any personal interaction. The metadata record of a geospatial dataset
    can follow this to help ensure that the integrity and accountability of this data
    are maintained.

    metadata.

    then ask, *w**hat is the value added?* to gain a better understanding of the package.
