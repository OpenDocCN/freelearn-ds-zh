			<p><strong class="bold">IBM Quantum Experience®</strong> with <strong class="bold">Qiskit®</strong> together form a popular and easy-to-use quantum computing platform. They let you access and program actual IBM quantum computer hardware in the cloud, but you can also run your code on local and cloud-based simulators. </p>
			<p>This book is designed to teach you how to implement quantum programming in a Python® environment, first at an elementary level, and later moving to more advanced examples. The locally installable <strong class="bold">Quantum Information Science Toolkit </strong>(<strong class="bold">Qiskit</strong>) software is built on Python and represents the most accessible tool available today for learning quantum computing.</p>
			<p>Throughout the recipes of this book, we will introduce the Qiskit classes and methods step by step, starting with the very basic concepts such as installing and upgrading Qiskit, checking which version you are running, and so on. We then move on to understanding the building blocks that are required to create and run quantum programs and how to integrate these Qiskit components in your own hybrid quantum/classical programs to leverage Python's powerful programming features.</p>
			<p>We'll explore, compare and contrast <strong class="bold">Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum</strong> (<strong class="bold">NISQ</strong>) computers and universal fault-tolerant quantum computers using simulators and actual hardware, looking closely at simulating noisy backends and how to mitigate for noise and errors on actual hardware, implementing the Shor code method for quantum error correction of a single qubit. </p>
			<p>Finally, we'll take a look at quantum algorithms to see how they differ from classical algorithms. We will take a closer look at coding Grover's algorithm, and then use Qiskit Aqua to run versions of Grover's and Shor's algorithms to show how you can reuse already constructed algorithms directly in your Qiskit code. We do all of this as a sweeping tour of Qiskit, IBM's quantum information science toolkit, and its constituent layers: Terra, Aer, Ignis, and Aqua. </p>
			<p>We will also use the online IBM Quantum Experience® user interface for drag-and-drop quantum computing. Everything we do in this book, and way more, can be coded in the cloud on IBM Quantum Experience®.</p>
			<p>Each chapter contains code samples to explain the principles taught in each recipe.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for developers, data scientists, researchers, and quantum computing enthusiasts who want to understand how to use Qiskit® and IBM Quantum Experience® to implement quantum solutions. Basic knowledge of quantum computing and the Python programming language is beneficial.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p>This cookbook is a problem-solution- and exploration-based approach to understanding the nuances of programming quantum computers with the help of IBM Quantum Experience®, Qiskit®, and Python.</p>
			<p><a href="B14436_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor021"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Preparing Your Environment,</em> walks you through how to install Qiskit® as a Python 3.5 extension on your local workstation. You'll also register with IBM Quantum Experience®, get your API key, and grab the sample code. </p>
			<p><a href="B14436_02_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor045"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Quantum Computing and Qubits with Python,</em> shows how to use Python to code simple scripts to walk you through the concept of bits and qubits and how quantum gates work without Qiskit® or IBM Quantum Experience®. </p>
			<p><a href="B14436_03_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">IBM Quantum Experience® – Quantum Drag and Drop,</em> looks at IBM Quantum Experience®, IBM Quantum's online, cloud-based drag-and-drop tool for programming quantum computers. Here you will code a simple program and learn how to move between Qiskit® and IBM Quantum Experience®.</p>
			<p><a href="B14436_04_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Starting at the Ground Level with Terra,</em> explores a set of basic quantum programs, or circuits, to examine fundamental concepts such as probabilistic computing, superposition, entanglement, and more. We will also run our first programs on an actual physical IBM quantum computer. </p>
			<p><a href="B14436_05_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Touring the IBM Quantum® Hardware with Qiskit®,</em> looks at the IBM Quantum® backends, exploring various physical aspects that impact the results of your quantum programs. </p>
			<p><a href="B14436_06_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Qiskit® Gate Library,</em> gives an overview of the quantum gates that are offered out of the box with Qiskit® to see what they do to your qubits. We take a look at the universal quantum gates from which all other quantum gates are built, and also expand from one-qubit gates, to the two-, three-, and more qubit gates needed for more advanced quantum circuits.</p>
			<p><a href="B14436_07_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor197"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Simulating Quantum Computers with Aer,</em> helps you run your circuits on a collection of simulators that you can use locally or in the cloud. You can even set your simulators up to mimic the behavior of an IBM Quantum® backend, to test your circuits under realistic conditions on your local machine.</p>
			<p><a href="B14436_08_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor220"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Cleaning Up Your Quantum Act with Ignis,</em> explains how to clean up your measurement results by understanding how our qubits behave, and looks at how we can correct for noise by using noise mitigation circuits such as the Shor code. </p>
			<p><a href="B14436_09_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor246"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Grover's Search Algorithm,</em> builds Grover's search algorithm, a quadratic speedup of classical search algorithms. We will use a unique quantum tool, quantum phase kickback. We build several different versions of the algorithm to run on both simulators and IBM Quantum® backends. </p>
			<p><a href="B14436_10_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know Algorithms with Aqua,</em> uses premade Qiskit Aqua versions of two of the most well-known quantum algorithms: Grover's search algorithm and Shor's factoring algorithm. We also take a quick tour of the Qiskit Aqua algorithm library.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>It helps if you have acquainted yourself a little bit with basic quantum computing concepts; we will not spend too much time with proofs or the deeper details. Python programming skills are also helpful, especially when we start building slightly more complex hybrid quantum/classical programs. A basic understanding of linear algebra with vector and matrix multiplication will definitely help you understand how quantum gates work, but we let Python and NumPy do the hard work.</p>
			<p>Qiskit® supports Python 3.6 or later. The code examples in this book were tested on Anaconda 1.9.12 (Python 3.7.0) using its bundled Spyder editor with Qiskit® 0.21.0, and on the online IBM Quantum Experience® Code lab environment. We recommend our readers to use the same.</p>
