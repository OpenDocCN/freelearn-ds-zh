- en: So far, you have learned that ArcGIS Pro has some powerful tools for visualizing
    and maintaining GIS data. *But what about analyzing that information?**Can it
    help you identify the landowners you need to contact along a road that will be
    repaired or get a count of customers within a given area?* ArcGIS Pro has the
    tools to help you answer these types of questions and a whole lot more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Answering these types of questions is done by using geoprocessing tools within
    ArcGIS Pro. *What is Geoprocessing?* Simply put, it is the manipulation of data
    used inside ArcGIS. Geoprocessing tools can analyze data, convert data from one
    format into another, add an attribute field to a table, or project data from one
    coordinate system to another. The sky is the limit regarding what you can do with
    geoprocessing tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the tools included in ArcGIS Pro, you can purchase extensions
    that add more capability to the software. The geoprocessing framework also provides
    avenues for you to create your own custom tools using **ModelBuilder**, **Python**,
    and other programming languages. You will learn more about ModelBuilder and Python
    in later chapters.

    of them create new data. This means that even if you choose the wrong tool or
    use a bad setting in the tool, in most cases, your original data is protected.
    This provides a level of protection and helps to put your mind at ease knowing
    the chances of damaging your data by doing the wrong thing are greatly decreased.

    tools such as **Buffer**, **Union**, and **Intersect**. You will not be able to
    use tools that allow you to find the closest feature in another layer or that

    the ones available at the Basic level. Many of these are focused on data management
    and maintenance. For example, the Standard level includes geoprocessing tools
    for creating relationship classes within a geodatabase. It also includes tools
    for managing an **Enterprise** or **Workgroup****geodatabase**. Finally, it includes
    tools for creating and managing topologies that allow you to validate or check
    your spatial data for errors based on the rules you apply.

    ArcGIS Pro. It has many tools in common with Spatial Analyst. The major difference
    is that 3D Analyst is designed to work with 3D vector data as opposed to raster
    data. It does have some ability to create and analyze raster data, but that is
    not its strong suit. It is not uncommon to use the 3D Analyst and Spatial Analyst
    extensions together. For example, you might take 3D vector data such as elevation
    contours and use 3D Analyst to create a DEM for additional analysis with the Spatial
    Analyst extension.
  prefs: []

    Irregular Networks** (**TIN**), **Light Detection And Ranging Laser** (**LiDAR

    in [Chapter 8](f9a95423-4c5e-4982-9a0c-6df17adaf24b.xhtml), *Editing Spatial and
    Tabular Data*. If your data does not have an elevation or height associated with
    it, 3D Analyst can drape your 2D data over a surface and then use that surface
    to calculate an elevation for your features in relation to the draped surface.

    So, you might be wondering why you would need the 3D Analyst extension. While
    visualizing 3D data is part of what ArcGIS Pro allows you to do out of the box
    with any license level, it does not allow you to perform analysis in 3D. You must
    have the 3D Analyst extension if you need to determine things such as slope or
    lines of sight or generate a **Digital Elevation Model** (**DEM**) in ArcGIS Pro.

    A network dataset is a collection of linear features that are connected by nodes
    that allow for bi-directional flow. This means you can move in either direction
    along the lines within the network. Network datasets are normally associated with
    transportation-related networks such as roads, railroads, sidewalks, or bike paths.
    These are typically not used for utilities as those are normally single-direction
    flow networks.

    service areas based on drive time requirements, find nearest features within the

    a Network Dataset. The Build Network tool creates the network dataset that you
    use as the foundation for the other analysis the extension performs.

    **Projections and Transformations** toolset. Certain tools and functions work
    best with different types of coordinate systems. There are two basic types of
    coordinate systems –**Geographic** and **Projected**. If you are trying to measure
    distances or areas, then a projected coordinate system works best.
  prefs: []

    in different coordinate systems will be displayed together, it is a recommended
    best practice that you place all the data that you are analyzing into the same
    common coordinate system. This avoids errors being caused by issues with different
    units and transformations.

    them into a new single output. This is useful if you get the same type of data
    from multiple sources or locations. For example, let's say you are working with
    a regional emergency response group and you are trying to develop a regional evacuation
    plan. You receive road data from multiple jurisdictions. You can use the Merge
    tool to combine them all into a single layer.

    points with points, lines with lines, and polygons with polygons.

    you just need to add newly acquired data to it. For example, continuing with the
    previous hydrant example, after merging the hydrants from the first four days,
    you collected some data. Now, you go out and collect more hydrant locations. You
    wish to add those newly collected hydrants to the merged layer to create.

    represents the rights-of-way for those roads. Also, each new polygon inherits
    the attribute values of the street that was buffered. This means that the new
    polygons are attributed to the road name and any other attributes that were linked
    to the street segments.

    buffers. If you choose to dissolve overlapping buffers, then any buffers that
    overlap will be merged into a single polygon. This reduces the number of features

    the new polygons will not contain the attribute information that was associated
