			<p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">In this chapter, you will learn about the different types of table calculations in Tableau, their benefits, and how to use them effectively. The goal of this chapter is to improve your analytical skills using table calculations by looking at data through different views to understand the underlying patterns. By the end of this chapter, you will be well positioned to perform complex analysis on the data in your visualizations using table calculations.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In any visualization, a virtual table is created based on the dimensions used in the view. This is added to the <strong class="source-inline">Columns</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Rows</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Marks</strong> shelves.</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1: Virtual table in the view</p>
			<p>The highlighted area in the preceding figure consisting of the <strong class="source-inline">Rows</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Columns</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Marks</strong> shelves will make up your level of detail. The empty canvas outline for dropping fields contains the virtual table that will be affected by table calculations.</p>
			<p>A table calculation is simply a calculation that computes results based on the table segment in scope. You will learn about segments and scope in detail in the following sections. For now, assume it is the entire empty canvas area. All table calculations will only be computed within the empty canvas outline or the virtual table.</p>
			<p>In previous chapters, you learned about visualization methods that present data in a meaningful way. There may be times where you need to analyze a table, such as when you want to find the most profitable sub-category within a category. This is where table calculations come in handy. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about table calculations and their applications through various exercises. You will also learn about the functions that are a part of table calculations, and how to apply them. You will use the <strong class="source-inline">Sample - Superstore</strong> dataset throughout the exercises.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Quick Table Calculations</h1>
			<p>Quick table calculations, as the name suggests, allow you to quickly apply frequently used table calculations to the view using the most typical settings for that calculation type. They save you the effort of using the column fields from data to create calculations. They have inbuilt logic , so you can use them directly in the view. Some of the most commonly used table calculations are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Running Total</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Percent of Total</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Percent Difference</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Percentile</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Rank</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Moving Average</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will start by learning how to apply quick table calculations, using the <strong class="source-inline">Sample - Superstore</strong> dataset. This file can be found by following the <strong class="source-inline">Documents</strong> | <strong class="source-inline">My Tableau Repository</strong> | <strong class="source-inline">Data Sources</strong> system path, and then opening the <em class="italic">Sample - Superstore.xls</em> file.</p>
			<p>To begin, create a view that shows <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> against <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong>, as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer580" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_02.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2: Initial view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2: Initial view</p>
			<p>Table calculations only work with measures, so you need a measure to add a calculation. To add a quick table calculation, first click on the measure dropdown, which is <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong> in this case.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer581" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3: Accessing the Profit drilldown</p>
			<p>Navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">Quick Table Calculation</strong> menu.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer582" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_04.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4: Various quick table calculations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4: Various quick table calculations</p>
			<p>You can see that there are numerous quick calculations available, such as <strong class="source-inline">Running Total</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Percentile</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Rank</strong>. You will now go through each of these in detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Running Total</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Running Total</strong>, as the name suggests, is used to calculate the cumulative total of a measure across a specific dimension or table structure. It adds up the previous value with the current value to display that result in the current value's place in the running total. For example, consider that you are working on a project related to a car manufacturer. A common use case for this calculation, would be to calculate the month-by-month cumulative car sales for a year, to find out the total sales for that year. You can also further calculate it on a year-by-year basis to find out the overall car sales to date. The next exercise looks at this in detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Exercise 8.01: Creating a Running Total Calculation</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the cumulative profit earned across different years for a particular category using the <strong class="source-inline">Running Total</strong> calculation. This allows you to view all years together for the profits earned, rather than individual years. The following steps will help you complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load the <strong class="source-inline">Sample â€“ Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance. In the <strong class="source-inline">Connect</strong> pane, click on <strong class="source-inline">Microsoft Excel</strong> and navigate to <strong class="source-inline">Documents</strong> | <strong class="source-inline">My Tableau Repository</strong> | <strong class="source-inline">Data Sources</strong>, and then open the <strong class="source-inline">Sample - Superstore.xls</strong> file.</li>
				<li>Create a view that shows <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> against <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong>, as follows:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer583" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_05.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5: Running total initial view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5: Running total initial view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Add a <strong class="source-inline">Running Total</strong> quick calculation to the view by selecting the following highlighted options:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer584" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_06.jpg" alt="Figure 8.6: Accessing Quick Table Calculation | Running Total&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.6: Accessing Quick Table Calculation | Running Total</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">The following view shows the final output:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer585" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_07.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7: Final output&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7: Final output</p>
			<p>As you can see, by comparing the previous figure (final view) with the next one (initial view), the profit has been summed cumulatively by taking the previous year's profit, as well as the current year's profit. With <strong class="source-inline">Furniture</strong>, for example, the second value under the running total is computed using the previous value and the current value, that is, 5,458 + 3,015 = 8,473, and this is done similarly for other values.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer586" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_08.jpg" alt="Figure 8.8: Initial view &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8: Initial view </p>
			<p>This view is helpful for calculating the cumulative profit earned, year after year, for the different categories, as well as for identifying which category has been performing well and which hasn't. These insights can help you make important business decisions to understand which products can be used to generate higher profits.</p>
			<p>Next, you will learn about the <strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong> table calculation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>Difference</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong>, as the name suggests, is used to calculate the difference of a measure across a specific dimension or table structure from its previous value. Often, you may need to analyze how individual categories compare with their past performances, i.e. comparing product sales from previous quarters. Continuing with the car manufacturer example, a common scenario to apply this calculation, would be to compare the sales for the months of a year. This allows you to find out whether the total sales are greater or fewer, compared to the previous months. In the following exercise, you will learn how to apply a <strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong> table calculation to a worksheet.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Exercise 8.02: Creating a Difference Calculation</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the profit difference across years for a category. This will help you analyze whether that category is profitable or not:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">Sample â€“ Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a view that shows <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> against <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong>, as follows:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer587" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9: Initial view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Add the <strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong> quick calculation to the view, as shown in the followingÂ figure:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer588" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_10.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10: Accessing quick table calculation difference&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10: Accessing quick table calculation difference</p>
			<p>The final view will be as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer589" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_11.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11: Final output&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11: Final output</p>
			<p>As you can see, the result is the difference between the current year's profit and the previous year's profit; for example, for <strong class="source-inline">Furniture</strong>, the second value under <strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong> is computed using the previous value and the current value, that is, 3,015 â€“ 5,458 = -2443. This is done similarly for the other categories. One thing to note here is the first year's value will always be blank, as there is nothing to compute the difference from.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you will learn about the <strong class="source-inline">Percent of Total</strong> table calculation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Percent of Total</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">Percent of Total</strong> calculation is used to calculate the percent distribution of a measure across a specific dimension or table structure. For example, if you are analyzing a project that operates in multiple countries, you can calculate what percentage of the total revenue each country generates. This in turn can highlight underperforming countries, as well as the better-performing ones.</p>
			<p>You will use this calculation in the next exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Exercise 8.03: Creating a Percent of Total Calculation</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the <strong class="source-inline">Percent of Total</strong> profits earned in different years for a category. By doing so, you can understand how each category has contributed to yearly profits. Perform the following steps to complete thisÂ exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">Sample â€“ Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a view that shows <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> against <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong>, as follows:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer590" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12: Initial view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Add the <strong class="source-inline">Percent of Total</strong> quick calculation to the view</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer591" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_13.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13: Accessing quick table calculation | percent of total&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13: Accessing quick table calculation | percent of total</p>
			<p>The following view is the final output:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer592" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16342_08_14.jpg" alt="Figure 8.14: Final output&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.14: Final output</p>
			<p>You can see that the profit has been converted to a percentage of the total, from all the years' profits. For example, for <strong class="source-inline">Furniture</strong>, you can first compute the sum of all the years' profits, which comes to 18,451. Then, divide each year's profits with this number. So, for 2016, you can compute it as 5,458 / 18,451, which is 29.58%.</p>
			<p>This view helps find out which year has been better for generating profits for each category. The next step  is to identify patterns indicative of higher profits in those years, and to try to replicate the patterns for the current year to generate similar or higher profits.</p>
			<p>The next section looks at the <strong class="source-inline">Percent Difference</strong> table calculation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Percent Difference</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Percent Difference</strong>, as the name suggests, is used to calculate the change in the percent distribution of a measure across a specific dimension or table structure. This calculation will first subtract a value from its previous value, and then compute the percentage change. As you may have noticed, this table calculation is a combination of the <strong class="source-inline">Difference</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Percent of Total</strong> calculations. The reason for using a percentage is that absolute numbers do not always show the complete picture. For example, the sale of 10 Ferrari cars will generate more profit compared to 50 Honda cars. But if you compare this using actual numbers, the data will say that Honda is more profitable, even though Ferrari is actually more profitable.</p>
			<p>You will learn more about using this calculation in the next exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Exercise 8.04: Creating a Percent Difference Calculation</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will be calculating <strong class="source-inline">Percent Difference</strong> across the different years for a particular category. This will help you analyze, in terms of percentage, the profit difference for the various categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">Sample â€“ Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a view that shows <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> against <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong>, as follows:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer593" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.15: Initial view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Add the <strong class="source-inline">Percent Difference</strong> quick calculation to the view:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer594" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.17: Final output</p>
			<p>As you can see, the output shows the difference between the current value and previous values, divided by the previous value; for <strong class="source-inline">Furniture</strong>, the percent difference for 2016 is computed as 3,015 â€“ 5,458 / 5,458, which comes to <strong class="source-inline">-44.8%</strong>.</p>
			<p>This view helps to compare the individual category profits in terms of percent, and identifies how each category has performed compared to the previous year. This can help you understand whether the category did better (or not), compared to the previous year.You can further investigate the reason for performance differences, and act on the analysis accordingly. </p>
			<p>Next, you will learn about the <strong class="source-inline">Rank</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Percentile</strong> table calculations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Percentile and Rank</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Percentile</strong>, as you may have guessed, is used to calculate the percentile of a measure across a specific dimension or table structure. Similarly, <strong class="source-inline">Rank</strong> will rank the measure across a specific dimension or table structure. You will learn about these in detail in the next exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Exercise 8.05: Creating Percentile and Rank Calculations</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will calculate <strong class="source-inline">Percentile</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Rank</strong> across different years for a particular category. This will help you understand how much profit various categories have generated in different years. Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">Sample â€“ Superstore</strong> dataset in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a view that shows <strong class="source-inline">Category</strong> against <strong class="source-inline">YEAR(Order Date)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">SUM(Profit)</strong>.</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.21: Percentile output on selecting the Percentile quick table calculation</p>
			<p>With the <strong class="source-inline">Rank</strong> calculation, you ranked each year in a particular category based on the sum of the profits. The preceding figure shows the <strong class="source-inline">Percentile</strong> operation. For <strong class="source-inline">Furniture</strong>, the profit for 2016 is at the 0th percentile, which means that 0% of data is under $3,015. Similarly, for 2017, the profit is $6,960 at the 100th percentile, meaning that the profit for all other years is below this value. This view can help you do a year-by-year comparison for individual category profits in terms of percentile and rank, to identify how each category has performed compared to the previousÂ year.</p>
			<p>Next, you will learn about the <strong class="source-inline">Moving Average</strong> quick table calculation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Moving Average</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Moving Average</strong> is used to calculate the average of a measure across a specific dimension or table structure in a dynamic range, rather than being static. The advantage of using a moving average is that more importance is given to the values of recent history, rather than using all historic data. Moving averages are commonly used for identifying trends of share prices, where you can analyze a 20-day moving average (last 20 days of share price), or a 50-day moving average (last 50 days of share price), to understand how the share price is moving. The next exercise looks at this in detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Exercise 8.06: Creating a Moving Average Calculation</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will calculate the moving average of profit earned across different years for a particular category. This will help you understand whether the average value is higher or lower than the previous year's profits:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.24: Final output</p>
			<p>As you see, the profit has been averaged across the total from all the years' profits. First, the sum of all the years' profits is computed, and then, this number is divided by the number of years. For example, for 2017, the moving average comes to 8,473 / 2 =Â 4,236.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Table Calculation Application: Addressing and Partitioning</h1>
			<p>In the previous section, you learned about quick table calculations. But did you notice that all these calculations were working at the row level? What if you need to apply calculations at the column level? This is where the concept of addressing and partitioning comes into play. </p>
			<p>Addressing means defining the direction of the calculation. A calculation can compute horizontally or vertically, depending on the option selected. Partitioning can be defined as the scope of the calculation; for example, you can partition a view into various years for different categories, or various categories for the same year.</p>
			<p>In this section, you will learn about the following methods to address and partitionÂ data:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Table(across)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Table(down)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Table(across then down)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Table(down then across)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Pane(down)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Pane(across then down)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Pane(down then across)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Cell</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Specific Dimensions</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will continue working with the same example that you have been using in the previous exercises. First, you will explore the various ways of addressing data.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Table (down)</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Table(down)</strong> computes the calculation vertically down the table, and restarts after each column.

			<p>This view can help you answer how each category has been performing based on profits across years. You could potentially make important business decisions based off these results.</p>
			<p>Next, you will learn about <strong class="source-inline">Table(across then down)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Table(down then across)</strong> together. These are opposites. <strong class="source-inline">Table(across then down)</strong> computes the calculation horizontally across the table and adds the values at the end of each row to the first value of the next row. <strong class="source-inline">Table(down then across)</strong> performs the calculation vertically down the table, and adds the values at the end of each column to the first value of the next column.</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="source-inline">Table(down)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Table(across)</strong> exercises, you treated the end totals for each column or row as separate values. So, you got a comparison for the different addressing results. For <strong class="source-inline">Table(across then down)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Table(down then across)</strong>, a value for the current row/column will be the result of the previous rows/columns along with the current row/column.</p>
			<p>Considering the previous example of car manufacturer sales, suppose you perform <strong class="source-inline">Table(down)</strong> and then <strong class="source-inline">Table(across)</strong> for sales; Tableau would first compute the sales for the current year for all products, and then add that value to the next year's values. Hence, for the current year, you would get cumulative values for the previous years and the current year's sales.</p>

			<p>Next, you will learn about panes. Table calculations can work down or across panes, depending on the calculation type.

			<p>They can also be thought of as smaller tables within a bigger table. Table calculations can be performed on panes similar to how you did at the table level. The following is a list of the various pane-related computations:</p>

			<p>There may be scenarios where you need to use the historic value of a measure to compute its current value, for example, when finding the cumulative sum of sales for all quarters in a year.This can, in turn, help you visualize the entire year's sales, or the sales difference, compared to previous quarters. In such cases, a table calculation can be useful, as all logic is inbuilt, and you need only apply the calculation to the measure value. </p>
			<p>In this activity, you will apply table calculations to a hospital-based project, to identify how many patients are currently admitted.You willconsider factors such as new admissions, discharges, and routine follow-ups, to check whether the threshold for beds is sufficient. By doing this, you can ensure the hospital will not run out of beds in the case of an emergency.</p>
			<p>In the dataset, there is a date column indicating the current day, an Open column indicating the number of patients admitted, Discharges indicating the number of discharges, and Re-open indicating the number of patients getting re-admitted or following up for a previous admission. In addition, you also need to keep 100 of the total 900 beds free in case of an emergency. If the number of patients exceeds 600, it should be highlighted visually.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The dataset used for this activity can be found and downloaded from <a href="https://packt.link/NNzlJ">https://packt.link/NNzlJ</a>.</p>
			<p>The following steps will help you complete this activity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open and connect the dataset for <strong class="source-inline">Activity 1</strong> in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Create a calculation named <strong class="source-inline">current_patients</strong> to find the number of patients currently admitted. This can be calculated after considering the <strong class="source-inline">Open</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Discharges</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Re-open</strong> columns.</li>
				<li>Once you have a bar chart view, display the date at the exact date level, along with the number of patients currently in the hospital, using the <strong class="source-inline">current_patients</strong> field created in the previous step. This view helps you view how many patients are admitted on a given day.</li>
				<li>Add a <strong class="source-inline">running_sum</strong> table calculation to the <strong class="source-inline">current_patients</strong> table calculation in the existing view. This view helps you visualize the number of patients admitted on a given day considering all the previous days as well.</li>
				<li>Create another calculation named Alert to indicate that the patient count is above 600. You need to use running_sum to identify the number of patients on a given day.</li>
				<li>Now, you should be able to analyze the total number of patients admitted to the hospital, and see whether there are enough beds available.</li>
				<li>The initial view is as follows:</li>

			<p>Here, you can see that in 2009, there was a period when the number of patients was more than the number of beds. Although such incidents are rare, it is imperative that they are managed properly.</p>
			<p>With this activity, you strengthened your knowledge of creating and using table calculations. This activity helped you see how you can use cumulative values to better analyze data, by highlighting anomalies or events that may have a significant businessÂ impact.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Activity 8.02: Planning for a Healthy Population</h2>
			<p>In the previous activity, you created a visualization to indicate a drastic increase in the number of patients. As an analyst, you should also be able to use historic data, and identify patterns when the number of patients go up.</p>
			<p>In this activity, you will use a range window to identify when the current admissions increase, and whether there is a specific observable trend. In this way, the hospital can be better prepared for the future. You will use the same hospital data used in the previous activity. The following steps will help you complete this activity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Plot the window average of the <strong class="source-inline">RUNNING_SUM</strong> of <strong class="source-inline">current_patients</strong>, weekly. A window average takes the average of all values in the window, which in this case is the view.</li>
				<li>Remove the average for the last 10-week range to check whether the count of currently admitted patients goes up or down. Create a parameter that can be used as input for the range; you can name it <strong class="source-inline">Range_input</strong>.</li>
				<li>Use this <strong class="source-inline">Range_input</strong> parameter as the input for the <strong class="source-inline">WINDOW_AVG</strong> calculation named avg_admitted. You need to calculate the average from the last 10 weeks to the current week.</li>
				<li>Use a dual-axis to show the <strong class="source-inline">RUNNING_SUM</strong> of current_patients and <strong class="source-inline">WINDOW_AVERAGE</strong>. Recall that a dual-axis is used to show two measures side by side in the same view. Right-click on the axis to enable this option after adding both measures.</li>
				<li>Create an alert to compare the <strong class="source-inline">RUNNING_SUM</strong> of <strong class="source-inline">current_patients</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">avg_admitted</strong>. Highlight the weeks when the sum is more than the average.</li>
				<li>The initial view would look like this:</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.79: Final view â€“ activity</p>
			<p>You can now see when the current admitted patient count has gone higher than the 10-week average. The range can be changed based on the requirement by changing the input. An interesting observation is the month of July, which had a higher-than-average number of patients for the all of the previous 3 years, indicating thepossibility for a similar occurance for next July.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about table calculations. You started by performing some quick table calculations, used to quickly apply commonly used table calculations in the view. Then, you explored ways to apply a table calculation using addressing and partitioning â€“ how addressing defines the direction of the calculation, while partitioning defines its scope. Finally, you learned about creating a table calculation using the calculation editor, and about ways to address the view using specificÂ dimensions. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn about <strong class="source-inline">Level of Detail</strong>, which is another powerful concept, used to control how views are displayed.</p>
