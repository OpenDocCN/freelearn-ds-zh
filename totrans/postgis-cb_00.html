<p class="mce-root">How close is the nearest hospital from my children's school? Where were the property crimes in my city for the last three months? What is the shortest route from my home to my office? What route should I prescribe for my company's delivery truck to maximize equipment utilization and minimize fuel consumption? Where should <span>the next fire station </span>be built to minimize response times?</p>
<p class="mce-root">People ask these questions, and others like them, every day all over this planet. Answering these questions requires a mechanism capable of thinking in two or more dimensions. Historically, desktop GIS applications were the only ones capable of answering these questions. This method—though completely functional—is not viable for the average person; most people do not need all the functionalities that these applications can offer, or they do not know how to use them. In addition, more and more location-based services offer the specific features that people use and are accessible even from their smartphones. Clearly, the massification of these services requires the support of a robust backend platform to process a large number of geographical operations.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Since scalability, support for large datasets, and a direct input mechanism are required or desired, most developers have opted to adopt spatial databases as their support platform. There are several spatial database software available, some proprietary and others open source. PostGIS is an open source spatial database software available, and probably the most accessible of all spatial database software.</p>
<p class="mce-root">PostGIS runs as an extension to provide spatial capabilities to PostgreSQL databases. In this capacity, PostGIS permits the inclusion of spatial data alongside data typically found in a database. By having all the data together, questions such as "What is the rank of all the police stations, after taking into account the distance for each response time?" are possible. New or enhanced capabilities are possible by building upon the core functions provided by PostGIS and the inherent extensibility of PostgreSQL. Furthermore, this book also includes an invitation to include location privacy protection mechanisms in new GIS applications and in location-based services so that users feel respected and not necessarily at risk for sharing their information, especially information as sensitive as their whereabouts.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><em>PostGIS Cookbook, Second Edition</em> uses a problem-solving approach to help you acquire a solid understanding of PostGIS. It is hoped that this book provides answers to some common spatial questions and gives you the inspiration and confidence to use and enhance PostGIS in finding solutions to challenging spatial problems.</p>

<p>This book is written for those who are looking for the best method to solve their spatial problems using PostGIS. These problems can be as simple as finding the nearest restaurant to a specific location, or as complex as finding the shortest and/or most efficient route from point A to point B.</p>
<p>For readers who are just starting out with PostGIS, or even with spatial datasets, this book is structured to help them become comfortable and proficient at running spatial operations in the database. For experienced users, the book provides opportunities to dive into advanced topics such as point clouds, raster map-algebra, and PostGIS programming.</p>

<p>Before going further into this book, you will want to install latest versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS (9.6 or 103 and 2.3 or 2.41, respectively). You may also want to install pgAdmin (1.18) if you prefer a graphical SQL tool. For most computing environments (Windows, Linux, macOS X), installers and packages include all required dependencies of PostGIS. The minimum required dependencies for PostGIS are PROJ.4, GEOS, libjson and GDAL.<br/>
A basic understanding of the SQL language is required to understand and adapt the code found in this book's recipes.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "We will import the <kbd>firenews.csv</kbd> file that stores a series of web news collected from various RSS feeds."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>SELECT ROUND(SUM(chp02.proportional_sum(ST_Transform(a.geom,3734), b.geom, b.pop))) AS population <br/>  FROM nc_walkzone AS a, census_viewpolygon as b<br/>  WHERE ST_Intersects(ST_Transform(a.geom, 3734), b.geom)<br/>  GROUP BY a.id;</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>SELECT ROUND(SUM(chp02.proportional_sum(ST_Transform(a.geom,3734), b.geom, b.pop))) AS population <br/>  FROM nc_walkzone AS a, census_viewpolygon as b<br/>  WHERE <strong>ST_Intersects(ST_Transform(a.geom, 3734), b.geom)</strong><br/>  GROUP BY a.id;</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; raster2pgsql -s 4322 -t 100x100 -F -I -C -Y C:\postgis_cookbook\data\chap5\PRISM\us_tmin_2012.*.asc chap5.prism | psql -d postgis_cookbook</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
