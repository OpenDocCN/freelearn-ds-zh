    into the following steps: data preparation, data exploration, data analysis, and
    distribution. This process typically starts with a question or a goal, which is
    followed by finding and getting the relevant data. Once the relevant data is available,
    you then need to prepare this data for your exploration and analysis stage. You
    might have to clean and restructure the data to get it in the right form, maybe
    combine it with some additional datasets, or enhance the data by creating some
    calculations. This stage is referred to as the data preparation stage. After this
    comes the data exploration stage. It is at this stage that you try to see the
    composition and distribution of your data, compare data, and identify relationships
    if any exist. This step gives an idea of what kind of analysis can be done with
    the given dataset.'

    (that is, at the data preparation stage); however, a quick and easy way to explore
    the data is to visualize it. Visualizing the data can reveal patterns that were
    difficult to recognize in the raw data.

- en: The data exploration stage is followed by the data analysis stage, in which
    you analyze your data and develop insights that can be shared with others. These
    insights, when visualized, will enable easier interpretation of data, which in
    turn leads to better decision making. In very simplistic terms, the process of
    exploring and analyzing the data by visualizing it as charts and graphs is called
    "visual analytics." As mentioned earlier, the idea behind visualizing your data
    is to enable faster decision making. Finally, the last step in the data analytics
    cycle is the distribution stage, wherein you share your work with other stakeholders
    who can consume this information and act upon it.

- en: In the preceding figure, you can see a grid view of fields such as `Product
    Type`, `Product`, `Market`, `Marketing`, and `Profit`. In the data that you have
    used, `Marketing` is the money that is spent on any marketing efforts to promote
    products, and `Profit` is the profit generated after those marketing efforts.
    Further, these values are broken down by dimensions such as `Product Type`, `Product`,
    and `Market`. The idea is to evaluate how each product is doing in terms of `Marketing`
    and `Profit` across different markets.

    in 84 numbers being shown in the view, and doing any kind of comparison across
    these 84 numbers is going to be very difficult. So, imagine you want to find out
    whether there are any products in any specific markets where losses are made even
    after spending significant money on the marketing efforts. Then you will end up
    comparing these numbers horizontally as well as vertically, which, honestly, is
    a bit tedious. However, let''s see whether visualizing this data makes any difference.
    Refer to the following figure:'

    spent on `Marketing`, whereas the color of the bar represents the `Profit` value.
    So basically, the longer the bar, the more money was spent on marketing; the darker
    the shade of blue, the more profitable the product; and the darker the shade of
    orange, the greater the loss accrued.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    `East` market. This means that `Caffe Mocha` has the highest marketing spending,
    but because the color of that bar is orange, you also know that it is accruing
    a loss.

    This is typically the tool you would spend your time on as most of your development
    is done using Tableau Desktop. Tableau Public can also be used for creating your
    analytics and visualizations. However, the catch here is that you cannot save
    your work locally or offline, and it will necessarily be saved to a Tableau Public
    server, which can be viewed by anybody. Tableau Public is a free version that
    is like Tableau Desktop and is typically used by bloggers, journalists, researchers,
    and so on who deal with public or open data.

    platform used to publish dashboards created in Tableau Desktop and share them
    with your end users. It allows you to share and, to some extent, edit and publish
    dashboards, while also managing access rights and making your visualizations accessible
    securely over the web. It allows you to refresh your dashboards at a scheduled
    frequency and maintain live data connectivity to the backend data sources, which
    in turn allows users to consume the up-to-date dashboards online from anywhere.
    Tableau Server also allows you to view your dashboards on a mobile tablet through
    an app available on both iOS and Android. Tableau Online, on the other hand, is
    a cloud-hosted version (or SaaS version) of Tableau Server. It brings the server
    capabilities of the cloud without the infrastructure cost.

    This is a free desktop application that can be used to open, view, and interact
    with dashboards and visualizations built in Tableau Desktop. So basically, it
    allows you to filter, drill down, view the details of data, and interact with
    dashboards to the full extent of what the author has intended. That said, being
    a reader, you cannot make any changes or edit the dashboard in any way beyond
    what has already been built in by the author.

    you don't have the necessary license, then you can even use Tableau Public to
    try out the examples covered in the book. As mentioned earlier, Tableau Desktop
    and Tableau Public are the two main developer products offered by Tableau and
    the only difference between these two products is the range of data source connectivity
    offered, the ability to save files locally, and the security of your work. While
    Tableau Desktop offers all this, Tableau Public has limitations.

    most appropriate one to answer your business questions. To elaborate on this point,
    begin by first categorizing your charts into four sections—namely, charts that
    help you either compare, determine the composition, show the distribution of your
    data, or else the ones that help you find relationships in your data.

- en: '**Comparison**: When analyzing your data, a common (if not the most common)
    use case would be to compare your data. Comparison is often done between two or
    more values. Some examples of comparison would be sales revenue in different regions,
    how the performance of a particular sales representative compared to their colleagues,
    the profitability of different products, and so on.'
  id: totrans-223

    is, *data members of a dimension* (for example, comparison across regions wherein
    `Region` is a dimension, and `East`, `West`, `North`, and `South` are the data
    members of that dimension), but it can also be done across *quantitative data*,
    that is, *across measures* (for example, sales versus profit or actual sales versus
    budget sales).
  id: totrans-224
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another type of comparison that is very common is a comparison over a period
    of time (for example, evaluating your monthly sales performance or which months
    are better for your business and whether there are any seasonal trends that you
    need to look out for).
  id: totrans-225

    as *comparison across dimensional items or categorical data (for example, region-wise
    sales)*, *comparison over time*, and *comparison across measures* or quantifiable
    data (for example, sales versus quota).

    typically referred to as a part to whole composition and it helps us understand
    how each individual part makes up the whole of something. For example, out of
    the total sales, which category is contributing the most? Or what is the breakdown
    of your total sales by region? And so on.'

    (for example, your market share along with the market share of your competitors
    at a given point in time), or you may also want to trend this information over
    a period of time (for example, how is your and your competitor's market share
    changing over a period of time). Both these perspectives are important and can
    provide some very valuable insights regarding your performance.

    data is another way of exploring and visualizing your data since visualizing geographic
    data on a map can help us highlight certain events or occurrences across geographies
    and possibly unearth some hidden spatial patterns and or perform proximity analysis.

    your files and share them with others. As you know, Tableau is an interactive
    tool that allows users to filter, drill down, and slice and dice data using the
    features that are provided within the tool. Now, when it comes to saving and sharing
    your work with others, some people may want their end users to have the flexibility
    to play with the report and use the interactivity that is provided, while others
    may simply want end users to have a static snapshot of information that doesn't
    provide any sort of interactivity. Further, some may want to share the entire
    dashboard with their end users, while others may only want to share a single visualization.

    outliers in your data. The dataset being used has two measures—namely, `Profit`
    and `Marketing`. `Marketing` refers to the money being spent on marketing efforts,
    while `Profit` is the profit that you are making. You need to compare `Marketing`
    and `Profit` across different products and across different markets (so, two dimensions
    and two measures).

    and data visualization. You were presented with several points for evaluation
    when choosing a data visualization tool and explored Tableau's product suite.
    Having identified Tableau Desktop as the best choice of platform for analyzing
    and visualizing your data, you looked at how to utilize it to connect to data
    and familiarized yourself with the Tableau Desktop workspace. You also considered
    various scenarios for data visualization and identified which charts to use for
    the given task and learned how to save and share your work with others.
