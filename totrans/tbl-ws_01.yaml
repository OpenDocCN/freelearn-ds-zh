    to visualize your data. You will connect to data using Tableau Desktop and familiarize
    yourself with the Tableau workspace. By the end of this chapter, you will be well
    acquainted with the Tableau interface and some of the fundamental important concepts
    that will help you get started with Tableau. The topics that are covered in this
    chapter will mark the start of your Tableau journey.

    into the following steps: data preparation, data exploration, data analysis, and
    distribution. This process typically starts with a question or a goal, which is
    followed by finding and getting the relevant data. Once the relevant data is available,
    you then need to prepare this data for your exploration and analysis stage. You
    might have to clean and restructure the data to get it in the right form, maybe
    combine it with some additional datasets, or enhance the data by creating some
    calculations. This stage is referred to as the data preparation stage. After this
    comes the data exploration stage. It is at this stage that you try to see the
    composition and distribution of your data, compare data, and identify relationships
    if any exist. This step gives an idea of what kind of analysis can be done with
    the given dataset.'

- en: Typically, people like to explore the data by looking at it in its raw form
    (that is, at the data preparation stage); however, a quick and easy way to explore
    the data is to visualize it. Visualizing the data can reveal patterns that were
    difficult to recognize in the raw data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data exploration stage is followed by the data analysis stage, in which
    you analyze your data and develop insights that can be shared with others. These
    insights, when visualized, will enable easier interpretation of data, which in
    turn leads to better decision making. In very simplistic terms, the process of
    exploring and analyzing the data by visualizing it as charts and graphs is called
    "visual analytics." As mentioned earlier, the idea behind visualizing your data
    is to enable faster decision making. Finally, the last step in the data analytics
    cycle is the distribution stage, wherein you share your work with other stakeholders
    who can consume this information and act upon it.

    Type`, `Product`, `Market`, `Marketing`, and `Profit`. In the data that you have
    used, `Marketing` is the money that is spent on any marketing efforts to promote
    products, and `Profit` is the profit generated after those marketing efforts.
    Further, these values are broken down by dimensions such as `Product Type`, `Product`,
    and `Market`. The idea is to evaluate how each product is doing in terms of `Marketing`
    and `Profit` across different markets.

    in 84 numbers being shown in the view, and doing any kind of comparison across
    these 84 numbers is going to be very difficult. So, imagine you want to find out
    whether there are any products in any specific markets where losses are made even
    after spending significant money on the marketing efforts. Then you will end up
    comparing these numbers horizontally as well as vertically, which, honestly, is
    a bit tedious. However, let''s see whether visualizing this data makes any difference.
    Refer to the following figure:'

- en: In the preceding figure, you can see that the length of the bar is the money
    spent on `Marketing`, whereas the color of the bar represents the `Profit` value.
    So basically, the longer the bar, the more money was spent on marketing; the darker
    the shade of blue, the more profitable the product; and the darker the shade of
    orange, the greater the loss accrued.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking back at that figure, note that the longest bar is `Caffe Mocha` in the
    `East` market. This means that `Caffe Mocha` has the highest marketing spending,
    but because the color of that bar is orange, you also know that it is accruing
    a loss.

    analytics and data visualization, Tableau is one of the leading tools in this
    space because of its ease of use and drag and drop functionality, which makes

    This is typically the tool you would spend your time on as most of your development
    is done using Tableau Desktop. Tableau Public can also be used for creating your
    analytics and visualizations. However, the catch here is that you cannot save
    your work locally or offline, and it will necessarily be saved to a Tableau Public
    server, which can be viewed by anybody. Tableau Public is a free version that
    is like Tableau Desktop and is typically used by bloggers, journalists, researchers,
    and so on who deal with public or open data.

    others using an online methodology with *Tableau Server* or *Tableau Online* or
    share an offline copy of your work, which can then be opened using *Tableau Reader*.

    platform used to publish dashboards created in Tableau Desktop and share them
    with your end users. It allows you to share and, to some extent, edit and publish
    dashboards, while also managing access rights and making your visualizations accessible
    securely over the web. It allows you to refresh your dashboards at a scheduled
    frequency and maintain live data connectivity to the backend data sources, which
    in turn allows users to consume the up-to-date dashboards online from anywhere.
    Tableau Server also allows you to view your dashboards on a mobile tablet through
    an app available on both iOS and Android. Tableau Online, on the other hand, is
    a cloud-hosted version (or SaaS version) of Tableau Server. It brings the server
    capabilities of the cloud without the infrastructure cost.

    This is a free desktop application that can be used to open, view, and interact
    with dashboards and visualizations built in Tableau Desktop. So basically, it
    allows you to filter, drill down, view the details of data, and interact with
    dashboards to the full extent of what the author has intended. That said, being
    a reader, you cannot make any changes or edit the dashboard in any way beyond
    what has already been built in by the author.

    to understand its workspace and see how you can create your visualizations and
    build your dashboards.

    you don't have the necessary license, then you can even use Tableau Public to
    try out the examples covered in the book. As mentioned earlier, Tableau Desktop
    and Tableau Public are the two main developer products offered by Tableau and
    the only difference between these two products is the range of data source connectivity
    offered, the ability to save files locally, and the security of your work. While
    Tableau Desktop offers all this, Tableau Public has limitations.

    A `Live` connection is the option that you use when you want to connect to data

    in Tableau. However, a quick point to note here is that the `Live` connection
    option relies on the data sources to process all the queries, and this could lead
    to performance issues in Tableau if the backend data source is a slow-performing
    data source. The `Extract` connection, on the other hand, is a snapshot of your
    data stored in a Tableau propriety format called `Tableau Data Extract`, which
    uses the file extension `.hyper`. Since the `.hyper` file only has a snapshot
    of the data, it will have to be refreshed if you need to see and use the updated

    members of that dimension), but it can also be done across *quantitative data*,

    scenarios and charts are explained in more detail in the upcoming chapters.

    the *geographic* aspect of your data (that is, if you have any geographical information
    in your data). This could mean having data at a country level, state level, city
    level, or even postal code level. Creating geographic maps to show this geographic
    data is another way of exploring and visualizing your data since visualizing geographic
    data on a map can help us highlight certain events or occurrences across geographies
    and possibly unearth some hidden spatial patterns and or perform proximity analysis.

- en: Another important point to discuss when working with Tableau is how to save
    your files and share them with others. As you know, Tableau is an interactive
    tool that allows users to filter, drill down, and slice and dice data using the
    features that are provided within the tool. Now, when it comes to saving and sharing
    your work with others, some people may want their end users to have the flexibility
    to play with the report and use the interactivity that is provided, while others
    may simply want end users to have a static snapshot of information that doesn't
    provide any sort of interactivity. Further, some may want to share the entire
    dashboard with their end users, while others may only want to share a single visualization.
