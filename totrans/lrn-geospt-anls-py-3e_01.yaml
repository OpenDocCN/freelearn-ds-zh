    illustrations, basic formulas, simple code, and Python. Building on that, you'll
    learn how to play with geospatial data—acquiring data and preparing it for various
    analyses. After that, you'll gain an understanding of the various software packages
    and libraries used in the geospatial technology ecosystem. At the end of this
    section, you'll learn how to evaluate any geospatial tool.
