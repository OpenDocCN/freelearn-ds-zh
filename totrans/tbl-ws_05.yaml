    and reference lines, and will see some examples of where they are frequently used.
    By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create charts for distributions,
    show relationships across data points, and create advanced chart types such as
    **Dual Axis** and **Quadrant** charts.

    reliant upon having both dimensions and measures in the view. However, there may
    be times, especially in business scenarios, where you only have measures to work
    with. In this chapter, you will learn how to create charts without dimensions,
    and also charts with multiple measures. You will learn to create relationships
    between measures, and will see how advanced Tableau skills like trend and reference
    lines can help better demonstrate insights to stakeholders.

    box plots, and whisker plots. Then, you will look at distributions across two
    measures using scatter plots, and scatter plots with trend lines (linear, logarithmic,
    and exponential). You will then look at advanced visualizations such as dual axis
    and quadrant charts for multiple dimensions/measures.

    values and can help identify any outliers. Histograms take your continuous measures
    and splits the range of measurements. They are placed into buckets known as bins.
    Each bin is essentially a bar in a histogram representing the count of that range
    of values falling within that bin.

    where the range of each bin is $10,000, your histogram would represent how many
    employees are earning $0-10,000, $10,001-20,000, $20,001-30,000, and so on.

    24 default chart types in the `Show Me` pane. Whenever you create a histogram
    in Tableau, bins/buckets of equal size are created, and Tableau creates a bin
    dimension (a local temporary dimension created for your bin ranges) for the measure
    you used while creating the chart.

    one of the most popular chart types due to their flexibility and the value they
    add to storytelling. Dual axis chart types are essentially two charts merged into
    one with a shared axis. For example, a date dimension could be the `x` axis and
    you could have two separate `y` axes on the same chart representing two different
    measures. An example of a dual axis chart for our `Superstore` dataset would be
    the trends of profit with regard to sales by year. Here, `Year` will be the `Date`
    dimension (`x` axis) and Sales and Profit will be the `y` axis. You will create
    a dual axis chart with similar mark types as part of the section.
