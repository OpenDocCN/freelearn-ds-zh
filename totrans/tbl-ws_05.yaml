    Comparison and Composition*. You will also cover the advanced topics of trend
    and reference lines, and will see some examples of where they are frequently used.
    By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create charts for distributions,
    show relationships across data points, and create advanced chart types such as
    **Dual Axis** and **Quadrant** charts.

  zh: 简介
- en: In previous chapters, you have learned about various charting methods that are
    reliant upon having both dimensions and measures in the view. However, there may
    be times, especially in business scenarios, where you only have measures to work
    with. In this chapter, you will learn how to create charts without dimensions,
    and also charts with multiple measures. You will learn to create relationships
    between measures, and will see how advanced Tableau skills like trend and reference
    lines can help better demonstrate insights to stakeholders.

  zh: 在前面的章节中，你已经学习了各种图表方法，这些方法依赖于视图中的维度和度量。然而，在某些时候，尤其是在商业场景中，你可能只有度量可以工作。在本章中，你将学习如何创建没有维度的图表，以及具有多个度量的图表。你将学习创建度量之间的关系，并了解高级Tableau技能，如趋势线和参考线，如何有助于更好地向利益相关者展示洞察力。
- en: First, you will explore distribution for a single measure using histograms,
    box plots, and whisker plots. Then, you will look at distributions across two
    measures using scatter plots, and scatter plots with trend lines (linear, logarithmic,
    and exponential). You will then look at advanced visualizations such as dual axis
    and quadrant charts for multiple dimensions/measures.

    of continuous and numerical quantitative data. However, bar charts, as discussed
    in the previous chapter, are used when plotting discrete and categorical data.

- en: A histogram represents frequency distribution. It shows the distribution of
    values and can help identify any outliers. Histograms take your continuous measures
    and splits the range of measurements. They are placed into buckets known as bins.
    Each bin is essentially a bar in a histogram representing the count of that range
    of values falling within that bin.

  zh: 直方图表示频率分布。它显示了值的分布，并有助于识别任何异常值。直方图将你的连续测量值分成测量范围，并将它们放入称为桶的组中。每个桶本质上是一个直方图中的条形，表示落在该桶内的值范围的计数。
- en: If you were to create a histogram of the salary of all the employees in a company,
    where the range of each bin is $10,000, your histogram would represent how many
    employees are earning $0-10,000, $10,001-20,000, $20,001-30,000, and so on.

  zh: 如果你创建一个公司所有员工的薪资直方图，其中每个桶的范围是10,000美元，你的直方图将表示有多少员工在赚取0-10,000美元、10,001-20,000美元、20,001-30,000美元等。
- en: It is straightforward to create a histogram in Tableau, as it is one of the
    24 default chart types in the `Show Me` pane. Whenever you create a histogram
    in Tableau, bins/buckets of equal size are created, and Tableau creates a bin
    dimension (a local temporary dimension created for your bin ranges) for the measure
    you used while creating the chart.

  zh: 在Tableau中创建直方图很简单，因为它是`Show Me`面板中的24种默认图表类型之一。每次你在Tableau中创建直方图时，都会创建大小相等的桶/组，Tableau为你在创建图表时使用的度量创建一个桶维度（为你的桶范围创建的一个本地临时维度）。

    distribution is using histograms. In this exercise, you will use the `Sample –

    significant. In the power trend line example, the p-value was very small (*p <

    it is highly likely you would see a similar trend, . For most use cases, any p-value
    greater than *p > 0.05* is considered statistically insignificant, which means
    if you were to repeat the same data collection, you would likely not get a similar

- en: Combination charts (otherwise known as dual axis charts or combo charts) are
    one of the most popular chart types due to their flexibility and the value they
    add to storytelling. Dual axis chart types are essentially two charts merged into
    one with a shared axis. For example, a date dimension could be the `x` axis and
    you could have two separate `y` axes on the same chart representing two different
    measures. An example of a dual axis chart for our `Superstore` dataset would be
    the trends of profit with regard to sales by year. Here, `Year` will be the `Date`
    dimension (`x` axis) and Sales and Profit will be the `y` axis. You will create
    a dual axis chart with similar mark types as part of the section.

- en: In this chapter, you explored distribution with one-measure histograms, box
    and whisker plots, and multiple-measure scatter plots. You also saw in detail
    the types of trend lines available in Tableau, why they are used, and which trend
    lines are most appropriate for given situations. Then, you learned how to check
    whether a trend line created by Tableau is reliable, and touched on the R-squared
    value and p-value. Finally, you explored advanced chart types, where we interacted
    with dual axis and quadrant charts. Finally, you completed some activities on
    dual axis charts with asynchronous axes, as well as scatter plots with filters
    and shapes.
