- en: The title of the book you are reading is *Time Series Indexing*, which should
    hint at its contents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The time series index discussed and explored in this book is called iSAX. iSAX
    is considered one of the best indexes for time series, which is the main reason
    for choosing it. Besides implementing iSAX and the SAX representation as Python
    3 packages, this book shows how to work with time series at the subsequence level
    and understand the information presented in academic research papers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the book does not stop here as it presents Python scripts for getting to
    know your time series data better and code for visualizing time series data and
    iSAX indexes to better understand the data as well as the structure of a particular
    iSAX index.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for developers, researchers, and university students of any level
    that want to work with time series at the subsequent level and use a modern time
    series index in the process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the presented code is in Python 3, once you understand the ideas and
    the concepts behind the code, the packages and scripts can easily be ported to
    any other modern programming language, such as Rust, Swift, Go, C, Kotlin, Java,
    JavaScript, and so on.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B14769_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *An Introduction to Time Series
    and the Required Python Knowledge*, is all about the fundamentals that you need
    to know to follow this book, including the importance of time series and how to
    set up a proper Python environment to run the code of the book and experiment
    with time series.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B14769_02_MA.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053), *Implementing SAX*, explains
    SAX and the SAX representation and presents Python code for computing the SAX
    representation of a time series or a subsequence. It also presents Python scripts
    that calculate statistical quantities that can give a higher overview of a time
    series and plot histograms of your time series data.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B14769_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081), *iSAX – The Required Theory*,
    presents the theory behind the construction and the use of the iSAX index and
    shows how to manually construct a small iSAX index step by step using lots of
    visualizations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B14769_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102), *iSAX - The Implementation*,
    is about developing a Python package for creating iSAX indexes that fit in memory
    and presents Python scripts that put that Python package into action.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B14769_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor124), *Joining and Comparing iSAX
    Indexes*, shows how to use iSAX indexes created by the `isax` package and how
    to join and compare them. At the end of the chapter, the subject of testing Python
    code is discussed. Last, we show how to write some simple tests for the `isax`
    package.'

    is all about visualizing iSAX indexes using various types of visualizations using
    the JavaScript programming language and the JSON format.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B14769_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160), *Using iSAX to Approximate
    MPdist*, is about using iSAX indexes to approximately compute the Matrix Profile
    vectors and the MPdist distance between two time series.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B14769_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183), *Conclusions and Next Steps*,
    gives you directions on what and where to look next if you are really into time
    series or databases by proposing classical books and research papers to study.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book requires a UNIX machine with a relatively recent Python 3 installation
    and the ability to install Python packages locally. This includes any machine
    running recent versions of macOS and Linux. All the code has been tested on a
    Microsoft Windows machine.

    management to have a stable Python 3 environment. We use Anaconda, but any similar
    tool is going to work fine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last, if you really want to make the best use of the book, then you need to
    experiment as much as you can with the presented Python code, create your own
    iSAX indexes and visualizations, and maybe port the code into a different programming
    language.
