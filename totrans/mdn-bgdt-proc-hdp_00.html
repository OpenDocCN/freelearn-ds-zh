<p class="mce-root">The complex structure of data these days requires sophisticated solutions for data transformation and its semantic representation to make information more accessible to users. Apache Hadoop, along with a host of other big data tools, empowers you to build such solutions with relative ease. This book lists some unique ideas and techniques that enable you to conquer different data processing and analytics challenges on your path to becoming an expert big data architect.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book begins by quickly laying down the principles of enterprise data architecture and showing how they are related to the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. You will get a complete understanding of data life cycle management with Hadoop, followed by modeling structured and unstructured data in Hadoop. The book will also show you how to design real-time streaming pipelines by leveraging tools such as Apache Spark, as well as building efficient enterprise search solutions using tools such as Elasticsearch. You will build enterprise-grade analytics solutions on Hadoop and learn how to visualize your data using tools such as Tableau and Python.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book also covers techniques for deploying your big data solutions on-premise and on the cloud, as well as expert techniques for managing and administering your Hadoop cluster. </p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this book, you will have all the knowledge you need to build expert big data systems that cater to any data or insight requirements, leveraging the full suite of modern big data frameworks and tools. You will have the necessary skills and know-how to become a true big data expert.</p>
