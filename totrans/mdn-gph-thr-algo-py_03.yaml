    science. Network science is not a commonly taught area of data science, but many
    problems can be framed through a network science perspective. Network-based algorithms
    often scale better than other machine learning algorithms, making them ideal for
    analyzing datasets with many variables, exploring spatial datasets with many locations
    represented, or spotting trends in high-dimensional time series data. Later chapters
    will delve more deeply into the topics with hands-on examples.

    between individuals, groups, and even societies within social networks using algorithms
    and statistical methods originating in a field of math called **graph theory**.
    Graph theory studies pairwise relationships between objects. Graph objects (including
    people, towns, ideas, points in time, and many more types of objects to study)
    are represented in network science as vertices, or points, within the network;
    note that some disciplines may use the term “*node*” instead of “*vertex*.” Relationships
    between objects (such as mutual collaborations between people or bridges connecting
    different islands or statistical connections between time points) are represented
    as edges within the network and connect pairs of vertices that share a relationship.

- en: Real-world networks are usually formalized and studied with tools from graph
    theory. As we’ve mentioned, graph theory defines relationships between objects
    in the form of vertices and the edges that connect related vertices. Let’s formalize
    this a bit and explore the foundations of network science found in graph theory.
    A graph is defined as a set of vertices and a set of lines, or edges, that connect
    pairs of vertices (Berge, 2001). Thus, a graph represents the structure of a network
    well. Returning to our hackathon social network, we represent our colleagues as
    vertices and connect them with edges if they collaborate.

    of a vertex can be shown with a loop connecting the vertex to itself. For instance,

    instance, reposting content is a unidirectional interaction (usually), but friending
    someone is a bidirectional interaction where both parties mutually connect. Unidirectional
    relationships are represented in a graph with directed edges, usually denoted
    with an arrow on visualizations of the graph. Bidirectional relationships have
    undirected edges, denoted as lines without arrows. *Figure 1**.4* shows a graph

    over time and how this may impact information exchange on networks. We’ll revisit
    social relationships in *Chapters 2, 3, 8*, and *9*. Now, let’s explore some other
    types of problems that can be formulated as networks.

    relationships can be defined on a much broader range of problems. Network science
    provides useful tools for understanding spatial data. For instance, consider a
    region with several small island towns connected by a series of bridges that allow
    goods and people to travel from region to region. During an epidemic, it might
    be useful to know which routes to close to minimize the spread of disease from
    one town to another. However, cutting off routes entirely would leave some areas
    without necessary supplies, such as food or medicine. Tools we’ll consider in
    later chapters can help regions plan the optimal routing of goods and minimize
    the potential spread of an epidemic.

    citrus fruit. Stores could be connected into a network based on shared management
    across stores, based on similarity of citrus fruit sales patterns, or based on
    geography (within the same county or country, for instance). How we define our
    network will impact what insight we can gain about regional citrus fruit sales
    and factors that might be impacting those sales patterns. We’ll explore this use

    tools to gain insight into patterns over time. For example, consider daily financial
    data across the tech, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. We can consider
    weekly correlations among the sectors and build a weighted network with edges
    defined by correlation values and track network properties over the weeks that
    exist in our data to pinpoint changes that might signal a coming market crash.
    Correlation networks among stocks and financial sectors are well studied, and
    we’ll return to this example in [*Chapter 6*](B21087_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078).

- en: Sometimes, we have spatiotemporal data, where our data has spatial and time
    series components. Consider the price of grain across several urban markets across
    a country. Pricing will vary across markets, with influences of local supply and
    demand, regulations in certain regions of the country, and local salaries likely
    influencing the price of grain at a specific market. Proximity to other markets
    and influences over time (such as the conflict in Ukraine limiting grain supplies
    globally) also influence pricing. By creating a series of networks based on geography,
    time period, and some of these other aforementioned factors, we can understand
    which markets tend to behave similarly with respect to grain price, which areas
    might be most vulnerable to price increases, and which areas might be most vulnerable
    to supply chain issues. This could allow an aid organization to pivot food aid
    more quickly to areas where people are unlikely to be able to afford future grain
    prices or may lose access to grain altogether. We’ll tackle this problem in [*Chapter
    7*](B21087_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088).

    temporal data. Deep learning models are ubiquitous in data science today, solving
    problems in computer vision, natural language processing, time series forecasting,
    and generative artificial intelligence. **Large language models** (**LLMs**) and
    text-to-image generators rely on a type of deep learning architecture called transformer
    models, feed-forward neural networks that find patterns in data by embedding input
    data, tuning attention weights, and decoding the data with respect to the outcome.
    These models can have billions or even trillions of parameters to tune across
    many connected layers. When combined with pre-trained **contrastive language-image
    pre-training** (**CLIP**) models, transformer models such as DALL-E can even generate
    realistic images based on text input. For instance, inputting *hyperdetailed photorealistic
    king cobra, background desert market* into NightCafe’s DALL-E algorithm produced
    the image in *Figure 1**.15*:'

    the convolutional neural networks often used to classify images), understanding
    connections across layers is critical to building good initial models that won’t
    require as much tuning and is helpful in tuning architectures based on network
    properties.

- en: Additionally, networks themselves may be modeled through a special class of
    deep learning algorithms, called graph neural networks, that take networks as
    input data and build regression or classification models based on some output.
    For instance, say we want to understand which networks are most vulnerable to
    the spread of fake news; in the 2014 and 2018 Ebola outbreaks, fake news regarding
    public health measures and virus sources hindered public health efforts and resulted
    in a greater loss of life, as well as some violent attacks on treatment centers.
    We may have a few hundred networks that we have studied and classified as high,
    medium, or low risk based on network properties and simulations of fake news spread
    on these networks, but we want to assess several hundred thousand scraped real-world
    networks collected from social media sites around the world. We can train a graph
    neural network on our classified data and apply it to the much wider collection
    of scraped networks to classify their fake news risks.

    in the mapping of ontologies. Ontologies organize relationships between objects,
    such as semantic relationships between words, regulatory relationships between
    genes, or symptoms shared between diseases. Often, multiple ontologies exist,
    such as the organization of consumer goods across store chains. Mapping one ontology
    to another provides a way to combine information from each ontology into a single
    entity. Given that each ontology exists as its own network being mapped onto other
    ontologies, the problem can be simplified to network mapping. We’ll explore this
    in more depth later in the book.
