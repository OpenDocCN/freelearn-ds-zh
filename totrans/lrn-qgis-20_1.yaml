    Also, the QGIS Project provides ready-to-use packages as well as instructions
    for building from source code on [download.qgis.org](http://download.qgis.org).
    We will cover how to install QGIS on the two most common systems, Windows and
    Ubuntu, as well as how to avoid the most common pitfalls.

    release version and the cutting-edge developer version, also called **master**.
    QGIS master will contain the latest and greatest developments, but be warned that
    on some days, it might not work as reliably as you are used to. For the tutorials
    in this book, we will be using the QGIS 2.0 release.

- en: 'On Windows, we have two different options to install QGIS: standalone installer
    and OSGeo4W installer. The standalone installer is one big download (approximately
    of 130 MB), which contains a QGIS release and the **Geographic Resources Analysis
    Support System** (**GRASS**) GIS in one package. The OSGeo4W installer is a small,
    flexible installation tool that makes it possible to download and install QGIS
    and many more OSGeo tools with all their dependencies. The main advantage of this
    over the standalone installer is that it makes updating QGIS and its dependencies
    very easy. You can always have access to both the current release and the developer
    version, if you chose so, but of course, you are never forced to update. That''s
    why I recommend using OSGeo4W. The OSGeo4W installer can be downloaded from [osgeo4w.osgeo.org](http://osgeo4w.osgeo.org)
    (or directly from [download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup.exe](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup.exe)).
    Download it and keep it! In the future, whenever you want to change or update
    your system, just run it again.'

    **Express Web-GIS**, and **Advanced** installation. To install the QGIS release
    version, we can simply select the **Express Desktop** option and the next dialog
    will list the available desktop applications such as QGIS, uDig, and GRASS GIS.
    We simply select QGIS, click on **Next** and download and installation will start
    automatically. When the installation has finished, there will be desktop shortcuts
    and start menu entries for OSGeo4W and QGIS.

    This installation path offers many options such as **Download without installing**
    and **Install from Local Directory**, which can be used to download all the necessary
    packages on one machine to later install them on machines without Internet access.
    It''s usually not necessary to change the default settings, but if your machine
    is, for example, hidden behind a proxy, you will be able to specify it here. After
    the installer fetches the latest package information from OSGeo''s servers, we
    get to pick the packages for installation. QGIS master is listed in the desktop
    category as **qgis-dev**. To select it for installation, click on the text that
    reads **Skip** and it will change and display the version number. The installer
    will automatically select all the necessary dependencies (such as GDAL, SAGA,
    OTB, and GRASS), so we don''t have to worry about that. After clicking on **Next**,
    the download and installation starts automatically just like in the Express version.
    The dialog will look like the following screenshot:'
