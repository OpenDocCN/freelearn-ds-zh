		</div>
		<div><p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">In this chapter, you will create your first chart in Tableau and work through some basic and intermediate charts, such as tree maps, bar-in-bar charts, and stacked area charts. You will learn how to choose the optimal chart for a given scenario, look at the best ways to create a trend report, and explore comparisons across measures (using bar-in-bar and bullet charts). Then, in this lesson's final activity, you will put all you've learned into practice by analyzing data from Singapore's vehicle population audits over the past decade. By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with working with bar charts, area charts, and <code>Marks</code> cards, which are used to add contextual detail to charts and views.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Thus far, you have prepared, imported, and manipulated data for your visualizations. Considering that Tableau is a <em class="italic">business intelligence and visualization tool</em>, it is natural to now start creating your first charts. Before you can do this, however, (and certainly before you can create more advanced charts as you will in <em class="italic">Chapter 5, Data Exploration: Distribution and Relationships</em>), you must first learn the ins and out of creating charts. </p>
			<p>For this reason, you'll only be creating some basic charts initially, and then eventually work through some intermediate-level charts, such as tree maps and bar-in-bar charts. The goal for this chapter is to be able to answer questions such as "<em class="italic">How much profit was generated in sales by each sub-category in a specific year?</em>," which is basically asking "<em class="italic">How much of your total sales was generated by each sub-category?"</em> In doing so, this chapter also teaches you how to remove complex terminology and communicate about data effectively.</p>
			<p>Tableau is an intuitive and flexible tool. You can consider Tableau the Photoshop of business intelligence. In Photoshop, there are multiple ways for you to achieve the same result with an image; similarly, in Tableau, there is often more than one way to create the same chart. Tableau's <code>Show Me</code> panel comes in pretty handy most of the time, though the goal of this book is also to show you methods for creating these charts without the <code>Show Me</code> panel. This chapter will try to simplify most charts by describing when they should be used, why a chart is useful, and for what data type they are useful. </p>
			<p>The whole chapter is designed so that, as a reader, you can follow along with detailed steps for each exercise and activity, including creating both basic and intermediate-level charts. But that does not mean you need to memorize these steps; instead, try to understand the reasoning behind why we are doing what we are doing. Although each step in the exercise of this chapter includes as many details as possible, you are encouraged to ask yourself questions such as, "<em class="italic">Why is this step being done, and can I improve the method?</em>" You might find that you can indeed obtain a given visualization using different means and, similarly, that the charts will get better as you unleash your creativity.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Exploring Comparisons across Dimensional Items</h1>
			<p>Before diving into chart making, it is important to differentiate between dimensions and measures.</p>
			<p>Every column that is present in some data has a data type associated with it, such as string, integer, or date. Also, every column that exists in some data is either a dimension or a measure. <strong class="bold">Dimensions</strong> are qualitative or categorical data, such as names, regions, dates, or geographical data, and the columns have categories of distinct values. Measures, on the other hand, are quantitative values that can be aggregated. </p>
			<p>Consider the following: a <code>Country</code> column has country names such as Canada, India, and Spain. Can you sum the regions? Would a sum of Canada, India, and Spain make any sense? No, it wouldn't, so a region is a dimension. Similarly, data to which you can apply mathematical functions, such as sum, average, min/max, and so on, are measures. Hence, the rule of thumb is as follows: columns to which you can apply a mathematical function are columns of measures, and data you cannot apply functions to are columns of dimensions.</p>
			<p>In this book, whenever measures are mentioned, it means that the chart will contain numerical/quantitative data in the view, whereas whenever dimensions are mentioned, we will be using qualitative/categorical data in the view.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Bar Chart</h2>
			<p>The bar chart is a versatile chart type that makes it easy to quickly understand data for spot checking or adding part of a total comparison for some categorical data. No other charts can beat the flexibility, ease of understanding, and usability of bar charts. The length of the bars in a bar chart represents the proportional aspect of the value for that categorical variable. The illustrative aspect of the bar chart makes it one of the most used charts; it gives accurate insights into our data. Bar charts in Tableau can use a combination of zero or more dimensions and one or more measures.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Exercises in this chapter will use the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset, which comes pre-loaded into each Tableau Desktop installation. Our version of Tableau Desktop contains another <code>Sample – Superstore</code> dataset, which has data till 2019; Tableau recently updated the data file to also include 2020 data, which you will have if you are using the latest version of Tableau Desktop. So, if your metrics/charts are not exactly the same as ours, do not worry. Our goal is to teach you the skills to develop these charts, reports, and dashboards instead of having you replicate our exact charts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Exercise 4.01: Creating Bar Charts</h2>
			<p>As a business analyst for your organization, one of the stakeholders has asked you to create a report displaying the total sales and profits across categories and segments using bar charts. You will be using the <code>Sample – Superstore</code> dataset to visualize the data.</p>
			<p>Dataset: <code>Superstore</code> </p>
			<p>Dataset download link: <a href="https://packt.link/cX32T">https://packt.link/cX32T</a>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In Tableau, <strong class="bold">continuous</strong> fields are <strong class="bold">green</strong>, and when they're <strong class="bold">discrete</strong>, they're <strong class="bold">blue</strong>.</p>
			<p>The following steps will help you complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load the <code>Orders</code> table from the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance. </li>
				<li>Click on the <code>Show Me</code> panel in the top-right corner and hover over the bar chart. You will observe that it says <code>For horizontal bars try 0 or more Dimensions</code> | <code>1 or more Measures</code>. </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_01.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1:  Bar chart in the Show Me panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1:  Bar chart in the Show Me panel</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you will begin with no dimensions and only one measure, before moving on to adding dimensions to your view.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Drag <code>Sales</code> to <code>Rows</code> (for a vertical bar chart) or <code>Columns</code> (for a horizontal bar chart). </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_02.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2: Changing the aggregation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2: Changing the aggregation</p>
			<p>When you drag Sales to the Columns/Rows shelf, the default aggregation changes to SUM(Sales). </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Click on the <code>SUM(Sales)</code> capsule in the <code>Columns</code>/<code>Rows</code> shelf and change the aggregation from <code>SUM(Sales)</code> to any other aggregation average.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_03.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3: Bar chart for the sales figure&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3: Bar chart for the sales figure</p>
			<p>In the preceding screenshot, note that the total sales figure is around <code>$2.3M</code> for the whole store, which is the least granular metric in our sample Superstore dataset. Next, you will change the granularity of your bar chart. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">To do that, add a dimension to your view. Add a <code>Category</code> dimension to our <code>Columns</code> shelf. When you add the <code>Category</code> dimension to the view, you get three bars to represent each category. Thus, you've just changed your granularity from the sum of sales for all the data to the sum of sales for each category.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For better readability, also add <code>Sales</code> from the <code>Measures</code> data pane to the <code>Label Marks</code> card. As we can see, <code>SUM</code>(<code>Sales</code>) is now divided by category:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_04.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4: Sales by category&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4: Sales by category</p>
			<p>The preceding chart uses one dimension and one measure, so we can see that the total sales of Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology are <code>$742,000</code>, <code>$719,000</code>, and <code>$836,000</code>, respectively. However, what if we want to study the total sales for each of these categories in more detail? We can make it more granular by adding more dimensions or measures. Let's explore our options in the next step.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Drag <code>Segment</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will notice that the sales by category are now divided into sales by segment and category. We just added another level of granularity to our view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_05.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5: Sales by category and segment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5: Sales by category and segment</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, you can see that even though <code>Technology</code> had the highest sales, the <code>Corporate</code> and <code>Home Office</code> segments of all three categories are not so performing well and will require attention. As the total sales of the categories are now bifurcated, it gives you more visibility as to how many sales you have in each of the segments (that is, <code>Consumer</code>, <code>Corporate</code>, and <code>Home Office</code>). Now that you know the sales values in greater detail, you can also find out the amount of profit gained in each of the categories and segments.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Add another measure, <code>Profit</code>, to the <code>Rows</code> shelf. As soon as you drop the measure onto the <code>Columns</code> shelf, you can see that a new row was added for profits:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_06.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6: Sales and profits by category and segment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6: Sales and profits by category and segment</p>
			<p>As you can see, there is very little profit gained from <code>Furniture</code> and a huge amount of profit from <code>Technology</code>. This will help in making great business decisions as we now know that investing more in <code>Technology</code> and <code>Office Supplies</code> is more profitable.</p>
			<p>When you create a bar chart one way, either horizontally or vertically, you will on occasion find that your dashboard design or storyboard design (a storyboard is where you use multiple visualizations/dashboards to convey a story) would be more aesthetically pleasing if the alignment was different—say, vertical instead of horizontal. There are multiple ways to change the alignment; the manual method is demonstrated in the next step.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Drag both the <code>Columns</code> dimensions to the <code>Rows</code> shelf and vice versa. Alternatively, Tableau makes it easy to swap things around by giving us a <code>Swap</code> button in our tool menu.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The final output is as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_07.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7: Horizontally aligned bars&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7: Horizontally aligned bars</p>
			<p>In this exercise, we explored how adding more granularity to our views can help add more context and data to our views without over cluttering.</p>
			<p>This wraps up this section on bar charts for one or more dimensional items. Next, we will explore comparisons over time by using bar charts and line charts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Exploring Comparisons over Time</h1>
			<p>As an analyst, one of the most common requests that stakeholders will have is about comparing certain KPIs/metrics over time (for example, revenue quarter on quarter). In this section of the book, you will use date dimensions to create charts with which you can compare your KPIs over a certain time period. You will use date dimensions to compare metrics using a bar chart first and then move on to using line charts for KPI comparison.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Exercise 4.02: Creating Bar Charts for Data over Time</h2>
			<p>Imagine you are a business analyst who is asked to provide a report about the total sales of your organization in different segments, namely, <code>Consumer</code>, <code>Corporate</code>, and <code>Home Office</code>, over a period of time. Use the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset provided by Tableau to visualize the chart and display the output. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete the exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the the <code>Orders</code> table from the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance. </li>
				<li>Drag <code>Sales</code> to your <code>Rows</code> shelf.</li>
				<li>Add <code>Order Date</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf. Tableau will automatically create a line chart (which will be covered in detail in the next exercise). </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_08.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8: Bar chart over time as a line chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8: Bar chart over time as a line chart</p>
			<p>The preceding figure shows the sales of the products on a yearly basis in the form of a line chart. To change the marks from line chart to bar chart, click first on the dropdown in the Marks shelf, then Bar as shown in the preceding figure. The view can be read as sales by year. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">For readability, add <code>Label</code> to <code>Bars</code> by dragging <code>Sales</code> from the measures <code>Data</code> pane to the label in the <code>Marks</code> card:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_09.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9: Sales by year (bar chart over time)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9: Sales by year (bar chart over time)</p>
			<p>As you can see, by adding the labels, you have the exact sales values earned in the respective years. But you still don't know the value of sales earned over time for each of the segments. You will have to change the granularity of the view from sales by year to sales by year by segment. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">To achieve that, drag <code>Segment</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The view can change a lot depending on where you place your <code>Segment</code> on the <code>Columns</code> shelf. If you place <code>Segment</code> after <code>Order Date</code>, your view will read as sales by year by segment with the following view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_10.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10: Bar chart over time by segment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10: Bar chart over time by segment</p>
			<p>From the preceding figure, it is clear that there has been progressive growth over the years, and you can also see the exact sales values for the segments. Although you got the data that you wanted, it is also important to present it in a formulated way. It will be more useful and understandable if you have the data for <code>Consumer</code> over the years together and the data for <code>Corporate</code> and <code>Home Office</code> together.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">To do this, place <code>Segment</code> before <code>Order Date</code>. Your view will read as sales by segment by year with the following view:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_11.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11: Sales by year by segment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11: Sales by year by segment</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 4.10</em>, you had sales by year by segment, whereas in <em class="italic">Figure 4.11</em>, you have sales by segment by year. This allows any stakeholder to take a quick peek at the sales trend for each of your segments. As you can see, <code>Corporate</code> saw considerable growth from 2017 to 2018, which was not easily understandable from the previous screenshot.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you reviewed bar charts over time and practiced adding more granularity and dimensionality to your data. Next, you will review comparisons over time using line charts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Line Charts</h2>
			<p>Line charts are another set of charts that are versatile, easy on the eye, universally understood. These have been used since the 18th century when William Playfair created them. They represent multiple data points connected with each other through a single line, usually signifying the trend of the data. In Tableau, you require at least one date, one measure, and zero or more dimensions to create a line chart.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Difference between Discrete Dates and Continuous Dates </h2>
			<p>In the upcoming exercises, when you right-click the <code>Date</code> dimension in the view, you'll notice you have two options for selecting the quarter. The one at the top is the discrete date, where you will have discrete dates by year/quarter/month/day. If you observe the following screenshot, instead of 2016 Q2 to 2016 Q3 ….. 2019 Q1 data points, you just have four data points—one for each discrete quarter. Essentially, discrete dates are unique dates in the view. So, when you select discrete quarters, the view will only contain unique quarters without considering the year as part of the date.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_12.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12: Discrete dates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12: Discrete dates</p>
			<p>The main difference between continuous dates and discrete dates is that continuous dates will give you more granular dates. So, instead of just Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, continuous dates will also factor in the year that the quarter/month/day is associated with. In most cases, you will want to use continuous dates because stakeholders often want to look at their metrics by month/quarter across multiple years.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_13.jpg" alt="Figure 4.13: Continuous dates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.13: Continuous dates</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Exercise 4.03: Creating Line Charts over Time</h2>
			<p>As an analyst, the category manager of your company would like you to create a chart so that they can look at the total profit across all the categories since 2016. They do not have a favorite chart type, but they do prefer a minimal look for their charts. In this exercise, you will tackle this stakeholder request as you go step by step in detail on how to make the best use of line charts and how adding color or changing the level of detail in the view adds incredible value to your charts.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete the exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <code>Orders</code> table from the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance, if you haven't already. </li>
				<li>Similar to the steps for the bar chart, drag one of the measures to the <code>Rows</code> shelf. In this exercise, drag <code>Profit</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf.</li>
				<li>Next, add <code>Order Date</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf. As soon as you add the <code>Date Time</code> dimension to your view, Tableau automatically creates a line chart (which you also saw previously in your bar chart view).</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_14.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14: Simple line chart over time&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14: Simple line chart over time</p>
			<p>In the chart, you have plotted profit by year and connected those points using a line. The profit grew from <code>$50,000</code> in <code>2016</code> to almost <code>$100,000</code> in <code>2019</code>.</p>
			<p>That is a basic line chart for you, but as previously mentioned, the goal is to learn more than just the basics of Tableau. So, let's explore some of the options for more context or details for your line chart.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Add a <code>Profit</code> label to your line chart by dragging <code>Profit</code> from the <code>data</code> pane to  <code>Label</code> <code>Marks</code> card in your view.</li>
				<li>To have the line chart show your sales by quarter instead of by year so it is more granular and helps decision-making for your stakeholders, click on the <code>+</code> sign or click the arrow on the dimension in your <code>YEAR(Order Date)</code> dimension on the <code>Columns</code> shelf and change the granularity from <code>YEAR(Order Date)</code> to <code>QUARTER(Order Date)</code>.</li>
				<li>To make your view even more granular, add <code>Segment</code> to your <code>Color</code> or <code>Detail</code> <code>Marks</code> shelf. Your data will be split by segment with a corresponding color for each segment, as observed here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_15.jpg" alt="Figure 4.15: Line chart by segment&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15: Line chart by segment</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, you can see that the profit for the <code>Consumer</code> segment has grown at a higher rate when compared to other segments. The line chart clearly illustrates the trend by segment across multiple years.</p>
			<p>This wraps up our coverage of line charts. This section discussed line charts over time, the difference between discrete dates and continuous dates, and how you can add more color or contextual details to your line charts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Exploring Comparison across Measures</h1>
			<p>Bullet charts are a type of bar chart that allow you to add target/goal comparisons to your charts/views. As much as bar charts are useful, more often than not when you are presenting data using bar charts, you will hear questions such as "<em class="italic">How does this compare to this KPI/metric?</em>" and "<em class="italic">So, what should we do with this data?</em>" because bar charts fail to add the additional context that stakeholders are looking for. This is where bullet charts shine as they add the required comparisons to goals/targets/thresholds. Think of bullet charts as bar charts with historical context or a baseline for comparison. </p>
			<p>Say you are working on a project for which you are presenting sales figures for your SaaS products as bar charts. The first question you receive from your stakeholders might be "<em class="italic">How does this compare to our previous quarter's/year's results? Did we do well or underperform?</em>" If you had shown the same data with bullet charts, you could have also added a point of comparison for the period you want to compare your sales figures to. Here is a sample bullet chart:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_16.jpg" alt="Figure 4.16: Sample bullet chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16: Sample bullet chart</p>
			<p>In the following exercise, you will create a bullet chart that tackles that problem and learn about the impact that bullet charts can have on your reports/presentations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Exercise 4.04: Creating a Bullet Chart</h2>
			<p>You receive another request from the category manager: they now want to look at how each of the sub-categories trends toward the sales target for 2019. As an analyst, your job is to create a view with actual sales for each sub-category for 2019 while showcasing the target sales (the black vertical lines in the following sample bullet chart) for 2019.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_17.jpg" alt="Figure 4.17: Sample bullet chart&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.17: Sample bullet chart</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">How to create a bullet chart using the <code>Show Me</code> panel could be studied here, but the book wouldn't do you justice if it didn't show you how to create a bullet chart using calculated fields, where you compare the sales of 2019 to the target sales of 2019 (which is a calculated field). We have not discussed calculated fields yet in the book, but we will be discussing them in depth in <em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Exploration: Exploring Geographical Data</em>; for now, we will just try to explain each step of this exercise in as much detail as possible.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete this exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <code>Orders</code> table from the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset in your Tableau instance if you haven't already. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Think of calculated fields as formulas that you can use to manipulate a field, create a subset of data, or extract information from rows/columns. In the following calculated fields, you will be creating two fields: <code>Sales Target 2019</code> and <code>Actual Sales 2019</code>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2"><code>Sales Target 2019</code> field will be 125% of the 2018 sales figures. To create a calculated field using your <code>Sales</code> measures and <code>Order Date</code>, first, navigate to the <code>Order Date</code> dimension and right-click on it. Click on <code>Create</code> | <code>Calculated Field...</code>:</li>

			</ol>
			<p>The formula is read as follows: if the year of order date is <code>2019</code>, make the target sales <code>125%</code> of the <code>2019</code> sales figures. </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21: Side-by-side bar charts for actual versus target sales</p>
			<p>In the previous figure, you have two charts: <code>Actual Sales</code> in <code>2019</code> and <code>Sales Target</code> in <code>2019</code> by sub-category. If you observe closely, you can see that Actual Sales 2019 for <code>Accessories</code> is <code>60,000</code> whereas <code>Sales Target 2019</code> is <code>75,000</code>, which is <code>125%</code> of <code>Actual Sales 2019</code>. In the next step, you will convert these two bar charts into a bullet chart.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Navigate to the <code>Show Me</code> panel and click on <code>Bullet Chart</code>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>As soon as you click on <code>Bullet Chart</code>, you will notice multiple bars with a black reference line that has been added to each bar. The reference line is the target/goal line that adds the additional context:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_22.jpg" alt="Figure 4.22: Bullet chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.22: Bullet chart</p>
			<p>You just created a bullet chart where the bars represent the sales targets in 2019 and the reference lines are the actual sales. But ideally, you want your sales targets in 2019 to be reference lines because that is the target that you want your sub-categories to aim for. You'll make those changes next.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">If your bullet chart has <code>Sales Target in 2019</code> as bars instead of the target line, you can right-click on the <code>x</code> axis and click on <code>Swap Reference Lines</code> (this may be <code>Swap Reference Line Fields</code> in later Tableau versions) to change your reference lines to target sales instead of actual sales:</li>

				<li value="9">For the other method where the <code>Show Me</code> panel is not used, create a new sheet and drag <code>Sub-Category</code> to <code>Columns</code>, <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> to <code>Columns</code>, and <code>Sales Target in 2019</code> to the <code>Details</code> <code>Marks</code> card.</li>
				<li>Right-click on the <code>x</code> axis and click <code>Add Reference Lines</code>. In the <code>Line</code> tab, click on the <code>Per Cell</code> radio button. In the <code>Value</code> dropdown, select <code>SUM(Sales Target in 2019)</code> and aggregate it as <code>SUM</code> in the dropdown right next to the <code>Value</code> dropdown.

			<p>In the preceding screenshot, the reference lines are now the sales targets for 2019, as opposed to the initial bullet chart where they were <code>Actual Sales 2019</code>, which was actually confusing. You want your stakeholders to understand how far off the target each of the sub-categories is.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you were able to create bullet charts using the <code>Show Me</code> panel as well as by manually adding reference lines to your view. We also briefly touched on calculated fields, which we will cover further in <em class="italic">Chapter 7: Data Analysis: Creating and Using Calculations </em>and<em class="italic"> Chapter 8: Data Analysis: Creating and Using Table Calculations.</em> </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Bar-in-Bar Charts</h2>
			<p>Similar to bullet charts, this type of chart is used when you want to compare two measures or two values in the same row/column. Essentially, it adds the comparison/goal/target context that every stakeholder is looking for in your report. It works pretty much like a bullet chart, the main difference being that instead of reference lines as comparison points, you will have another secondary bar embedded within your primary bar.</p>
			<p>Think of a scenario similar to that of the bullet chart (for example, the US presidential election of 2019). As the electoral college votes were being counted, the Democrat and Republican vote counts were racing toward the target seat amount of 269. As the hours passed and more votes were counted, the actual number was updated and grew even closer to the target number of 269. That is a good example of where a bar-in-bar chart, such as the following, can be used.</p>

			<p>The previous view that you created for tracking actual sales versus target sales had a reference point in the view that, without additional helpful text and explanation, would have been confusing for stakeholders. The category manager has asked you to make the actuals versus targets comparison simpler. As an analyst, after researching potential chart ideas, you identify the bar-in-bar chart as a great chart for a simpler view. You will be re-creating the bullet chart view with same dimensions and measures but will be utilizing a bar-in-bar chart. You will be using the same <code>Superstore</code> dataset for the analysis. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete the exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <code>Orders</code> table from the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset if it's not already open in your Tableau instance. </li>
				<li>Drag <code>Sub-category</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf and <code>Sales Target 2019</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf.</li>
				<li>Drag <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> to the view and hover over the <code>Sales Target 2019</code> axis until you get two green stack bars highlighted in the axis, and then drop <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> on the <code>Sales Target 2019</code> axis as shown here:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.27: Sales by sub-category bar chart </p>
			<p>In the preceding screenshot, you just plotted sales by sub-category, and in the next step, you will color-split these bars into actual versus target so that you can achieve your desired bar-in-bar result.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Drag <code>Measure Names</code> from the <code>Rows</code> shelf to the <code>Color</code> <code>Marks</code> card on the left. As soon as you do that, the two measures will be distinguished by different colors and will be stacked on top of each other:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.28: Sales by actual versus target 2019</p>
			<p>By adding <code>Measure Values</code> to <code>Columns</code> and adding <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> and <code>Sales Target 2019</code> to the <code>Measure Values</code> <code>Marks</code> card, you will see you were able to stack two bars on top of each other, with the orange bar being <code>Sales Target 2019</code> and the blue bar being <code>Actual Sales 2019</code>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">You'll also notice that both the measures are stacked on top of each other rather than starting at zero. Essentially, the <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> bar starts where <code>Sales Target 2019</code> ends, which is not how you want your data to be presented. To change that, navigate to <code>Analysis</code> in the menu, select <code>Stack Marks</code>, then choose <code>Off</code>.</li>

				<li value="6">As much as the current view looks good, you also want to differentiate <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> and <code>Sales Target 2019</code> by size too. Do this by dragging <code>Measure Names</code> from the <code>Dimensions</code> data pane and dropping it on the <code>Size</code> <code>Marks</code> card, as shown here:</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="7">If you want, you can swap the measure that is in the foreground. The current view is good as <code>Actual Sales 2019</code> is in the foreground and is racing toward <code>Sales Target 2019</code>, but if you want to change this, just swap the measures in the <code>Measure Values</code> card and play with the size, color, or width of the bar:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.31: Bar-in-bar chart</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, the blue bar is <code>Actual Sales 2019</code>, which is racing toward <code>Target Sales 2019</code>, which is the orange bar. For example, the <code>Bookcases</code> sub-category has actual sales of <code>30,000</code> in <code>2019</code> and is racing toward the sales target of approximately <code>33,000</code>.</p>
			<p>You could have also achieved the same bar-in-bar chart using dual axis, but we will be covering that in the next chapter. Here, we went with a standard approach and learned how to utilize <code>Measure Names</code> and <code>Measure Values</code>, which play an important role in Tableau report/dashboard building.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Exploring Composition Snapshots – Stacked Bar Charts</h1>
			<p>A stacked bar chart is nothing but a bar chart with an extra level of detail embedded in the bars, where each bar represents distinct dimensions/values. Stacked bar charts come in handy when you want to compare the whole to a segment of the dimensions/value, which are essentially smaller segments of the same bar. Think of the revenue generated by a car company: as an analyst, you want to show the revenue split by car/product type in a single bar graph without using too much space. By color-coding the bar chart with the car type, you can create a single graph with lots of contextual detail.</p>
			<p>Think of stacked bar charts as showing <strong class="bold">totals against parts</strong>:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Exploring Composition Snapshots – Pie Charts</h1>
			<p>Although pie charts are quite often used, in the author's personal experience and the opinion of industry leaders in the field of data visualization, they are best avoided in reports/dashboards because it gets difficult to draw insights accurately from them. Pie charts often confuse even the best in the business. Notice how it is easy to trick people with the following pie chart (tricking people is not what we as data analysts/visualizers are supposed to do):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_39.jpg" alt="Figure 4.39: Sample pie chart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.39: Sample pie chart</p>
			<p>The goal of the pie chart is to display market penetration levels for brands A, B, and C. A simple visual inspection may cause one to believe that Brand A and C have equal market penetration, but in reality the difference between them could be several millions of dollars due to a couple of percentage points' difference. Therefore, it is recommended not to use pie charts. That said, if there is no way to avoid using them, keep in mind the following rule of thumb: if your pie chart has more than six labels, you are better off creating either a bar chart or a stacked bar chart. </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Treemaps</h2>
			<p>Like pie charts and stacked bar charts, treemaps help you answer parts-of-the-whole types of questions, but the main difference is that treemaps and bar-in-bar charts show hierarchical relationships using rectangles. Using <code>Marks</code> card elements such as <code>Color</code> and <code>Size</code>, you can better analyze the data. When a rectangle is bigger or has a more concentrated color, it represents the highest value of the dimension in the view. Treemaps allow you to quickly measure contributions to the whole. Like pie charts, treemaps are not always the best choice, but depending on the analysis needed, treemaps can use contextual labels for better readability; they are also one of those chart types where you can plot hundreds of data points in a view.</p>
			<p>Think of a case where the VP of delivery operations has requested a presentation on the total deliveries to each state as well as whether deliveries in those states were on time or not. Using treemaps, you can compare the delivery activity for each of the states, where the number of deliveries is communicated by the size of the rectangle for each state and the proportion of deliveries that were delayed is shown by color:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Exercise 4.08: Creating Treemaps </h2>
			<p>As an analyst, you want to create a view of profitable versus non-profitable states by category without using a cross-table in your view. For this exercise, you will use the <code>Superstore</code> dataset. You are required to color-code the states based on their profitability and sort the states in descending order based on total sales. The reason you are using treemaps for this is that you can use both size and color to convey information without sacrificing anything. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete the exercise:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset if it's not already open in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>For this exercise, you have two measures: <code>Sales</code> and <code>Profit Ratio</code>. You will use <code>Sales</code> for sizing and <code>Profit Ratio</code> for coloring the treemap. Drag the primary measure (in this case, <code>Sales</code>) to the <code>Size</code> <code>Marks</code> card and the secondary metric, <code>Profit Ratio</code>, to the <code>Color</code> <code>Marks</code> card:</li>

			</ol>
			<p>When you add <code>State</code> to the <code>Detail</code> <code>Marks</code> card (in Tableau version 2020.1), you will see that <code>Country</code>/<code>Region</code> is automatically added as <code>State</code> is part of the hierarchy. Remove <code>Country</code>/<code>Region</code> from the <code>Detail</code> <code>Marks</code> card because it is not adding any value or detail to your view. While you are at it, drag <code>State</code> as a label:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.47: Color coding by profit ratio</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, you have represented sales and profit ratios by states. California and New York have the largest number of sales (larger rectangles means more sales), but states such as Michigan have higher profit ratios (darker blue means higher profits).</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">You could potentially stop the analysis/charting here, and this would be your treemap representing sales by each state and their profit ratios. However, in this case, you'll add another layer of detail to your view.

			<p>The main difference between this view of the treemap (<em class="italic">Figure 4.50</em>) and the default treemap you created in the previous step (<em class="italic">Figure 4.48</em>) is that in the latest treemap, instead of color-coding your profit ratio with gradient colors, you color-coded loss as red and profit as green, so it's easier for stakeholders to quickly view the most profitable and least profitable states.</p>
			<p>If you look, you can see that California is the highest-selling state across all categories, and if you want to know the profit ratio of the state, all you have to do is hover over any of the states.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Area Charts</h2>
			<p>Area charts are among the most visually pleasing charts available and are used pretty frequently for reporting cadence. Area charts are essentially combinations of line charts and bar charts in that they show the relationships between the proportions of the total.</p>
			<p>Think of a use-case wherein the branch manager of an electronics company wants to look at the total quantity sold in each television category by the series that they belong to. You can fulfill this requirement by using a stacked bar chart, but with an area chart, you can also add time trends, which is what you will explore in this exercise here.  </p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Note: Word of caution for area charts</p>
			<p class="callout">When you use an area chart as a stacked area chart, it can easily be misinterpreted—especially if you use stacked area charts for percentages. For example, say you are creating an email marketing report where you have conversion rates for different campaigns. Campaign 1 had a click-through rate (CTR) of 3%, campaign 2 had a 7% CTR, and campaign 3 had a 6% CTR for a particular month. The true CTR for that month was 5.3%, but using a stacked area chart, the CTR for all campaigns may show up as 16%, which is factually incorrect. Just be aware of the caveats here.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Exercise 4.09: Creating an Area Chart</h2>
			<p>The director of financial operations reaches out to you, looking to understand how the sales for each sub-category trends across each month. The director wants to know whether they sell more in July or August. As an analyst, your job is to create a color-coded area chart showing sales by month of the year and how sales trend across the year. You will continue to utilize the <code>Superstore</code> dataset for this exercise. You will also explore continuous as well as discrete area charts in this exercise, utilizing <code>Order Date</code>, <code>Sub-Category</code>, and <code>Sales</code>. </p>
			<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the sample <code>Superstore</code> dataset if it's not already open in your Tableau instance.</li>
				<li>Drag <code>Order Date</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf and change the granularity from year to month by clicking the arrow on the <code>Order Date</code> capsule and selecting continuous <code>Month</code> (you will first create a continuous stacked area chart). </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_52.jpg" alt="Figure 4.52: Continuous month selection&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.52: Continuous month selection</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Drag <code>Sales</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf. As soon as you drop it onto the <code>Rows</code> shelf, a line chart is created.</li>
				<li>Drag <code>Sub-Category</code> from data pane onto <code>Color Marks</code> card to and then change the <code>Marks</code> type from <code>Automatic</code> to <code>Area</code> using the dropdown:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_53.jpg" alt="Figure 4.53: Area chart &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.53: Area chart </p>
			<p>The preceding chart represents the continuous stacked area chart. If you don't want the areas to be stacked on top of each other, you can turn off stacking.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Navigate to <code>Analysis</code> in the menu and click on <code>Stack Marks</code> | <code>Off. </code>Similarly, you follow the same steps to turn the stack marks back on:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_54.jpg" alt="Figure 4.54: Turn Stack Marks off &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.54: Turn Stack Marks off </p>
			<p>The only reason that someone would want to turn off <code>Stack Marks</code> in an area chart is if they want to look at individual trends for the dimension in question (in this case, Sub-Category). The limitation of an unstacked area chart is that it carries a risk of hidden data points because what the background area represents is not clear:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.55: Area chart</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">To change the area chart to be discrete, change the type of <code>Order Date</code> from <code>Continuous</code> to <code>Discrete</code>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B16342_04_56.jpg" alt="Figure 4.56: Discrete dates selection &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.56: Discrete dates selection </p>
			<p>With discrete charts, instead of <code>Month</code> for each year, now you only show discrete months without considering the year in the view. The view is a less granular view compared to that of the continuous stacked area chart. You will change the axis tick marks from $50,000 to $25,000 increments. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">To change the axis tick marks, right-click on the <code>Sales</code> axis and click on <code>Edit Axis…</code>.</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.57: Editing the axis </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">In <code>Edit Axis [Sales]</code>, click on <code>Tick Marks</code> (this may be <code>Major Tick Marks</code> in later versions) and select <code>Fixed</code>, then set <code>Tick interval</code> to <code>25000</code>, as shown here:</li>

			<p>In the preceding screenshot, each of the sub-categories is stacked on top of each other, while the sales trends are shown across months. From the given chart, you can easily make out that November is the highest-grossing month for the <code>Superstore</code> dataset.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you learned when and when not to use area charts, looked at stacked versus non-stacked area charts, and studied the best use cases for continuous and discrete area charts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Activity 4.01: Visualizing the Growth of Passenger Cars in Singapore </h2>
			<p>Recently, the Singapore government appointed a new head of vehicle inspection. This newly created department will analyze vehicle sales over the past few decades, study growth/trends, and create policies and rules to further help the government reduce emissions. As part of the initial onboarding, the head of vehicle inspection has asked to look at sales trends for each vehicle category, including buses, taxis, cars, and goods vehicles. They expect an analyst to create a single view showcasing the trends for sales of these vehicle categories. As an analyst, considering that the head of vehicle inspection expects to see trends across multiple categories and years, you decide to use an area chart with color coding for easier readability.</p>
			<p>In this activity, you will be showcasing the skills that you have learned in this chapter by creating multiple charts. You will be using the <code>SG_Annual_Vehicle_Population</code> data, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://packt.link/wLR2x">https://packt.link/wLR2x</a>.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to complete this activity: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Import and open the data that was downloaded.</li>
				<li>Drag <code>Category</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf and <code>Number</code> to the <code>Rows</code> shelf.</li>
				<li>Drag <code>Year</code> to the <code>Columns</code> shelf.</li>
				<li>Drag and drop <code>Category</code> to the <code>Color</code> <code>Marks</code> card.</li>
				<li>Drag and drop <code>Year</code> to the <code>Label</code> <code>Marks</code> card.</li>
				<li>Change the <code>Axis</code> title to just <code>Year of Audit</code>.</li>
				<li>Edit the axis to change <code>Major Tick Marks</code> to <code>Fixed</code> and set the intervals to <code>1</code>.</li>
				<li>Change the title of the worksheet to <code>Activity 4.1</code>.</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>That wraps up this chapter. In this lesson, you created your first charts in Tableau, starting with bar charts, which are used for comparisons across dimensions, followed by line charts to show comparisons over time. You also looked at how bullet charts and bar-in-bar charts differ and the best use cases for them when exploring comparisons across measures. </p>
			<p>You further composed snapshots, working through three major chart types: stacked bar charts, pie charts, and treemaps. When exploring treemaps, instead of using a standard treemap, you added an extra layer by utilizing multiple measures where the primary measure, <code>Sales</code>, was used for the size of the rectangle and a secondary measure, <code>Profit ratio</code>, was used for profit/loss using two different colors. The different colors made it easier for stakeholders to identify profit-making states across superstore categories. </p>
			<p>Although we did discuss line charts for time series data, we also decided to work through an area chart problem and study the issues with stacked (<em class="italic">cannot aggregate percentages</em>) versus non-stacked (<em class="italic">risk of hidden data</em>) area charts. We briefly touched on continuous versus discrete stacked area charts. We wrapped up the chapter by working through a new dataset on Singapore's annual vehicle population audit and created an area chart for understanding the different trends of vehicle growth over the past 15 years in Singapore.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will take a step forward and work through dual axis, histograms, box and whisker plots, and scatter plots, as well as discussing some statistics related to reference lines and when to use different reference line models. Consider the next chapter as covering advanced charting in Tableau.</p>
