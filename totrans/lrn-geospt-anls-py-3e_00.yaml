- en: The book starts by giving you the background of geospatial analysis, and then
    offers a flow of the techniques and technology used and splits the field into
    its component specialty areas, such as **Geographic Information Systems** (**GIS**),
    remote sensing, elevation data, advanced modeling, and real-time data. The focus
    of the book is to lay a strong foundation in using the powerful Python language
    and framework to approach geospatial analysis effectively. In doing so, we'll
    focus on using pure Python as well as certain Python tools and APIs, and using
    generic algorithms. The readers will be able to analyze various forms of geospatial
    data, learn about real-time data tracking, and see how to apply what they learn
    to interesting scenarios.

- en: While many third-party geospatial libraries are used throughout the examples,
    a special effort will be made by us to use pure Python, with no dependencies,
    whenever possible. This focus on pure Python 3 examples is what will set this
    book apart from nearly all other resources in this field. We will also go through
    some popular libraries that weren't in the previous version of the book.
