- en: Natural Language Processing is used everywhere—in search engines, spell checkers,
    mobile phones, computer games, and even in your washing machine. Python's Natural
    Language Toolkit (NLTK) suite of libraries has rapidly emerged as one of the most
    efficient tools for Natural Language Processing. You want to employ nothing less
    than the best techniques in Natural Language Processing—and this book is your
    answer.

- en: '*Python Text Processing with NLTK 2.0 Cookbook* is your handy and illustrative
    guide, which will walk you through all the Natural Language Processing techniques
    in a step-by-step manner. It will demystify the advanced features of text analysis
    and text mining using the comprehensive NLTK suite.'

    WordNet and how to use it. Learn the basics as well as advanced features of stemming
    and lemmatization. Discover various ways to replace words with simpler and more
    common (read: more searched) variants. Create your own corpora and learn to create
    custom corpus readers for data stored in MongoDB. Use and manipulate POS taggers.
    Transform and normalize parsed chunks to produce a canonical form without changing
    their meaning. Dig into feature extraction and text classification. Learn how
    to easily handle huge amounts of data without any loss in efficiency or speed.'

    Tagging*, explains the process of converting a sentence, in the form of a list
    of words, into a list of tuples. It also explains taggers, which are trainable.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Extracting Chunks"), *Extracting Chunks*,
    explains the process of extracting short phrases from a part-of-speech tagged
    sentence. It uses Penn Treebank corpus for basic training and testing chunk extraction,
    and the CoNLL 2000 corpus as it has a simpler and more flexible format that supports
    multiple chunk types.'

    Chunks and Trees*, shows you how to do various transforms on both chunks and trees.
    The functions detailed in these recipes modify data, as opposed to learning from
    it.'
