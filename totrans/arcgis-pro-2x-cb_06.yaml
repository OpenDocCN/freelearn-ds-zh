    tool is the ability to overlay multiple layers of information together in a map.
    Putting our GIS data in real-world coordinate systems and projections is how we
    are able to do this. By placing our data in a real-world system, we tie it to
    the Earth. This allows us to locate features anywhere on the Earth’s surface and
    then bring them into a map so we can see how those features are related spatially.

- en: There are two basic types of coordinate systems we can use in ArcGIS Pro, geographic
    and projected. A geographic coordinate system is based on a 3D model of the earth,
    called the ellipsoid or spheroid. The ellipsoid is then tied back to the physical
    Earth by the datum. Geographic coordinate systems use degrees as their primary
    unit of measurement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Each degree can then be broken down into different sub-units, such as decimal
    degrees, minutes, decimal minutes, or minutes, and seconds. You will often hear
    geographic coordinate systems referred to as **Latitude** and **Longitude**:'

- en: The primarily lines of reference used in a geographic coordinate system are
    the **Equator** and the **Prime Meridian**.  These are the starting points for
    determining the latitude and longitude values required to locate a feature's position.
    Geographic coordinate systems can be used to identify the location of a feature
    on the Earth very accurately. However, as the diagram illustrates, the distance
    between the lines of latitude and longitude are not consistent. It varies depending
    where on the Earth you are located. This makes it difficult to measure distances
    and areas. This is where projected coordinate systems come in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Projected coordinate systems locate and display data in a 2D plane, using a
    cartesian coordinate system. This allows us to apply standard units of linear
    measurement, such as feet and meters. The origin of the projected coordinate system
    is tied to a geographic coordinate system. This is what ties the projected coordinate
    system to the earth. From the origin, an *x* and *y* axis is defined, along with
    the units, as illustrated in the following diagram. Because projected coordinate
    systems use uniform units, we are able to easily measure distances and areas:'

- en: Of course, taking a 3D surface such as the Earth and flattening it does introduce
    distortions into our data. So, we have different methods of projecting the data
    from a 3D model to a 2D plane to reduce these distortions. There are three basic
    types of projections, planar, conic, and cylindrical. From there they can get
    more advanced.

- en: As long as all your data is in a real-world coordinate system, regardless of
    what type, ArcGIS Pro can display it in a single map or scene, even if the layers
    are in different coordinate systems. It will project the data on the fly in that
    map or scene to a common coordinate system. So, it is important that all your
    spatial data is assigned the correct coordinate system. Otherwise your data may
    be displayed incorrectly and results of your analysis might be incorrect.

    in order to display data in a location. However, it not only can impact how and
    where features are displayed, but also what you can do with the map. The coordinate
    system used by a map can impact if you can share it as a web map via ArcGIS Online,
    how well layers overlay one another, and more. So, it is important to know what
    coordinate system your map is using.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be wondering why you would want to change the coordinate system for
    a map. There are several reasons why you might want to change the coordinate system
    assigned to a map. As mentioned in the introduction, some coordinate systems are
    better suited for specific operations. If you need to measure areas or distances
    for analysis or editing, a projected coordinate system is best, especially for
    small areas such as a county, city, or district. If you are trying to show locations
    of features across large areas, such as a country or the world, then a geographic
    coordinate system is often best. If you are publishing as a web map then it might
    require the map be in the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) coordinate
    system to conform with other datasets. So, if you need to do one of these and
    your map is in a different coordinate system, you might need to change it. Luckily
    it is not hard to change the coordinate system for a map, as you are about to
    see.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Changing the coordinate system for a map does not change the coordinate system
    for the underlying data referenced in the map. This means that if you have a shapefile
    in your map as a layer, and that shapefile is in NAD 83 UTM Zone 16N Meters, then
    if you change the Map Coordinate system to the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary
    Sphere), this will not change the coordinate system the shapefile is stored in.
    In other words, changing the coordinate system of the map does not project the
    data it references to a new coordinate system. You will learn how to project data
    to a different coordinate system later in this chapter.

    changed. It is still being stored in the same coordinate system it has always
    been in. So just changing the coordinate system for the map does not change the
    source data's coordinate system. It only changes how it is displayed in that specific
    map. ArcGIS Pro projects the data on the fly from the coordinate system it is
    stored in to that the map is displaying. This is very useful when working with
    data from multiple organizations which may not use the same coordinate system
    as yours. One thing to remember though is that projecting on the fly does use
    more computer resources and will slow down the rendering of the data every time
    you pan or zoom in the map.

- en: You now know how to assign and change the coordinate system used in a map. Maps
    are not the only thing that are assigned a coordinate system. Our data is also
    assigned a coordinate system, or at least it should be. If your data is not assigned
    a coordinate system then ArcGIS Pro may not be able to display the correct location
    with all your other data. This is also true if your data is assigned the wrong
    coordinate system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where is the coordinate system information stored within your data? Well, that
    depends on what type of data you are working with. If it is a feature class stored
    in a geodatabase, then the coordinate system information is stored within the
    geodatabase itself. If you are working with shapefiles, then the assigned coordinate
    system is stored in a file with a .prj file extension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are working with CAD data, meaning `.dwg`, `.dxf`, or `.dgn` files, then
    you will also need a `.prj` file in order for ArcGIS Pro to know what coordinate
    system it is in. While some CAD files can be assigned a coordinate system within
    the drawing itself, ArcGIS Pro cannot access that part of the file, so you must
    have an external `.prj` file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you saw in [Chapter 2](b6f25e84-28a9-4d2d-aaca-3550460d4650.xhtml), *Creating
    and Storing Data*, in the *Creating a new Geodatabase* recipe, when you create
    a new feature class in a geodatabase, you are asked to assign the coordinate system
    as part of the Create Feature Class tool. So, in most cases, when you create new
    feature classes or shapefiles, you will assign the coordinate system for that
    data as you create it. However, you will find that many existing or legacy datasets
    do not have a coordinate system defined. This is true mostly for shapefiles and
    CAD files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just because a dataset does not have an assigned coordinate system does not
    mean it was not created in a real-world coordinate system. The majority of all
    shapefiles are created in a real-world coordinate system. They are just missing
    the `.prj` file required by ArcGIS Pro and other Esri products to know what the
    coordinate system is. The same is true of many CAD files as well, though you will
    encounter a larger number of CAD files that are not in a real-world coordinate
    system. You will learn more about that in a later chapter. If the data that is
    missing from the coordinate system was created in the same coordinate system as
    the rest of your data, you can still use it for maps, to perform analysis, and
    more, without defining the coordinate system for the data. It is when you try
    to mix data in different coordinate systems that you will start to encounter problems
    if you try to publish the data to a web service or convert it to another format.
    So, it is generally considered best practice to always define a coordinate system
    for all your data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you will learn how to define a coordinate system for data that

    will have new coordinates that represent values in the coordinate system it has
    moved to. To calculate the new coordinate values, ArcGIS Pro must perform many
    calculations for each feature to account for possible changes in datums, units,
    reference locations, earth models, and more. So, it can take a long time for larger

- en: Notice that a Geographic Transformation is automatically applied. Transformations
    apply mathematical adjustments when projecting data, to account for differences
    in datums. The original coordinate system for the City Limits layer referenced
    the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 1983). The WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary
    sphere) coordinate system references the WGS 84 datum. While these are both Earth-centered
    datums, they are slightly different. That difference must be accounted for when
    the data is projected. That is what the transformation does.

    that the layer’s data source is not supported, is referring to the Basemap. We
    are not concerned with the basemap since one can be added in ArcGIS Online if
    you use the City_Limits_Web layer in a web map. You will learn more about creating
