- en: The complex structure of data these days requires sophisticated solutions for
    data transformation and its semantic representation to make information more accessible
    to users. Apache Hadoop, along with a host of other big data tools, empowers you
    to build such solutions with relative ease. This book lists some unique ideas
    and techniques that enable you to conquer different data processing and analytics
    challenges on your path to becoming an expert big data architect.

- en: The book begins by quickly laying down the principles of enterprise data architecture
    and showing how they are related to the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. You will get
    a complete understanding of data life cycle management with Hadoop, followed by
    modeling structured and unstructured data in Hadoop. The book will also show you
    how to design real-time streaming pipelines by leveraging tools such as Apache
    Spark, as well as building efficient enterprise search solutions using tools such
    as Elasticsearch. You will build enterprise-grade analytics solutions on Hadoop
    and learn how to visualize your data using tools such as Tableau and Python.
